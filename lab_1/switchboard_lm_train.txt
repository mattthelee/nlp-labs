whos your favorite team
my favorite team is the $unc$pittsburgh $unc$steelers
$unc$pittsburgh
you bet
i used to be a big $unc$pittsburgh fan when i was little
i
when $unc$john $unc$stallworth played he was from my hometown in $unc$alabama
really
so i kind of grabbed on to that team way back when
thats pretty nice
yeah
thats good
i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big steel curtain
thats right
how about your favorite team
last year it was $unc$buffalo
and i still try to keep up with $unc$buffalo because they just impressed me as being so efficient
and they never score
they never blow out their opponents
they just score just enough points
uh-huh
and that really impressed me
but then down here i li-
is pretty close to $unc$new $unc$orleans
and ive been keeping up with the $unc$saints a lot
they are exciting arent they
yeah
the $unc$saints are starting to impress me this year a lot
they are just a fun team to watch
they are really
did you see the game $unc$sunday afternoon
no
i didnt
it was funny
they ha- a fireworks display at halftime
yeah
yeah
and some paper or something in the $unc$super $unc$dome up in the roof caught on fire
youre kidding
so they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire
my gos-
those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field
so theres this big fire on the field
and they were dumping the $unc$gatorade bucket and everything
i cant believe that
it was funn-
you just really cant tell whats going to happen
thats hilarious
i know
its like about $unc$two weeks ago i was watching the $unc$saints
uh-huh
and $unc$morton $unc$anderson kicked a $unc$sixty yard field goal
oh
and it was beautiful right down the middle
boy
he is tough
he has an incredible leg
he is
yes
do you think theyre going to be able to make it this year past the first playoff game
i sure hope so
im not sure who they play
right now ive got it narrowed down to the top $unc$four teams
whos that
its pretty much going between $unc$washington they are undefeated and $unc$buffalo $unc$new $unc$orleans and $unc$chicago because $unc$chicago has only lost twice
right
and $unc$one of those was to $unc$buffalo
and they beat the saints
their only time they lost
what do you think about $unc$houston
$unc$houston
i saw $unc$houston play this summer in $unc$memphis
yeah
yeah
from what i saw they were playing
when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the $unc$houston $unc$oilers
and from what i saw the game $unc$houston impressed me a lot
huh
but my brother watched it on t v and said that $unc$warren $unc$moon was just having an off night
and if that was an off night id hate to see when hes on a good night
yeah
he definitely is $unc$one of the best i think
hes
yeah
their backfield is really impressive
$unc$haywood $unc$jeffreys and $unc$drew $unc$hill and $unc$allen
right
they really impress me
they squeaked out a game on $unc$sunday
thats right
who did they play
they played $unc$dallas
$unc$dallas
thats right
they won in overtime
all because
thats right
i remember that now
so that was
i watched that game
and that was
do you have a favorite between those $unc$two
because im right here in $unc$dallas i kind of pull for $unc$dallas
really
yeah
also $unc$houston is in pittsburghs division
so ill almost always root against them
thats true
i hate to say it
but i hate $unc$dallas
thats okay
i was never really a big $unc$dallas fan until we moved here
yeah
and they just kind of grew on me
yeah
i imagine
thats the way
ive never been a big $unc$saints fan until the last year or $unc$two
and theyve actually started doing something
yeah
yeah
so ive actually paid attention to them
do you know anything about the expansion teams theyre thinking about bringing in
to tell you the truth i havent paid too much attention to that
really
what cities are they looking at
right now i think this $unc$memphis theyre trying to get the teams
uh-huh
and thats where i was when i saw $unc$houston play
uh-huh
$unc$saint $unc$louis is trying to get a team
$unc$baltimore is trying to get a team
and theres some other city
im wanting to say $unc$raleigh $unc$durham
but im not sure
i think you are right
i think it is $unc$raleigh
think so
i think i remember hearing that
uh-huh
because i know theyve got a football team
but i think it might be them
that would be fun
id like to see some more teams get in
i would definitely
i think they are supposed to put $unc$two in by either next year or the year after
and right now i think its $unc$memphis and i think $unc$baltimore have a really good shot at it
uh-huh
because i know $unc$saint $unc$louis is much bigger than $unc$memphis
and when i went up there they were saying that $unc$memphis sold more tickets than $unc$saint $unc$louis did
really
yeah
its like the $unc$liberty $unc$stadium in $unc$memphis holds about $unc$sixty-two
okay
this topic is is $unc$russia a threat to our security
i think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time
how do you feel about it
they do have a major internal problem
everybody wants to defect
and i can understand why
i think their biggest problem is just obtaining food to live
so when you have the basic needs being unmet i dont think you think globally as far as being a threat to other people in the world
so as soon as they get their own home country taken care of then theyll consider what they can do with the rest of the world
i believe communism is very much waning
its pretty much on the way out of the door insofar as the strong hold that they used to have
and the russian people are all realizing that the $unc$communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world
and their rebellions right now is the result of that
if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that it will be on the way out eventually
its just a matter of time because in the $unc$baltic states they have already massacred so many people who protested
and that hasnt set too well with their diplomacy regarding the outcome of their affairs
whats your synopsis
i do realize that the $unc$bush $unc$administration isnt too happy with how theyre handling their internal strife as far as diplomacy is concerned
i think its been a good positive direction for the $unc$soviets as far as $unc$yeltsin is concerned
he was allowed to
wh-
in the $unc$congress they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned which gives him more power overall which i think is a good sign that there will be some
politically speaking hes going to have more power
and i think its a step in the right direction
i think $unc$gorbachev realizes that hes got a major power figure competing against him
and i think its going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesnt follow suit with $unc$yeltsin as far as realizing
he does realize it with the fact that they increased the prices on their food and goods
uh-huh
it
i think that it went up a $unc$thousand percent on most
yeah
thats incredible
but they had to go in the direction of a market driven economy
and they had to bite the bullet for that
so thats a good move on gorbachevs part in doing that
uh-huh
but $unc$gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that hes moving towards a $unc$two to $unc$three party system of government nor eliminating or diminishing the $unc$communist power
and i guess thats where $unc$yeltsin steps in so far as his politics of government goes
but i dont know how convinced the people are of him yet myself
thats all they got right now
thats their ray of hope
uh-huh
so theyll go with whoever comes through for them
its just that the weird thing is that $unc$gorbachev is the $unc$one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and perestroika and stuff
and i think hes got between the $unc$old $unc$guard and the new glasnost
i think its kind of escalated to a point where its out of control
uh-huh
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on both sides
so i think thats kind of where hes stuck
you know what im saying
yeah
i understand
and thats the situation that he finds himself in
and hes a tough guy
hes been through it
so i have no doubt that hell
i think overall hes been a good figure for the $unc$soviet $unc$union
i think his intentions and his ideals are well intentioned
uh-huh
and in the long-term
but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people dont have
i think that makes the problem most severe and makes him look worse that what his ideals are personally
i agree
whats bad for the $unc$soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food
but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should
i think its a lot of oh how do you put it bureaucracy and $unc$one thing and then all the corruption
i think theres a large amount of corruption on the have and the have-nots
yeah
thats probably more true than a lot of people realize
i know youre going to have that with every society
at least were more blatant about it
but its very secret
and its been going on for years
you cant change things overnight
uh-huh
but if it gets to a point where people cant survive theres revolution
and thats
it seems to be headed in that direction too
yeah
big time
major
but thats what happens when the cork blows
and you cant handle it anymore
thats the way the world revolves that way
and i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things too
they
probably not enough
but im sure i lot of its filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what theyre missing out on
yeah
i think theyre starting to realize
but i just dont think they have the resources if you were to compare the $unc$americans to the $unc$soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to
i dont think they even realize whats out there and to what extent
yeah
im sure a lot of them are missing those household items
yeah
the major conveniences of life
yeah
what we consider just normal everyday things to them is real luxury which is unfortunate for them
yeah
and of course most of us we dont really appreciate what weve got because weve been so used to it
this is true
this is very true
and we
its human nature though to take things for granted
and it kind of
when youve lost something or dont have what other people have thats when you tend to realize whats out there and what you have and what you dont have
yeah
i agree
so the original question do we think theyre a security threat
yeah
yes and no
yeah
i can go with that answer too
the only yes i could go to is if a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange
but i dont even see that occurring because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to i guess
no
i dont really feel that the $unc$soviets really want to blow up the world
we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as nonfeeling machine type people
and theyre people just like us
they get up everyday
uh-huh
and they put their pants on the same way
and they have to eat and everything else
and i just dont feel that
okay
why dont you start cause it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an nursing home now
yes
i do
do you
i have a grandmother
shes a $unc$hundred and $unc$two
my gosh
shell be a $unc$hundred and $unc$three in $unc$august
uh-huh
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
and then my sister takes care of her
uh-huh
even though she is a $unc$hundred and $unc$two she still has all of her faculties
right
she still has her snap
she takes care of her own business
this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker
but with somebody that needs around the clock care
i have seen my family age
right
i have seen them in the
shes been there $unc$ten years now
and i have seen them age $unc$twenty in the time and with the expense and everything
yeah
i still think it is worth it if you had a good nursing home
and they needed some quality care
i would put someone in a nursing home
right
my mother-in-law finally
they had to make a family decision
theres $unc$seven children in my husbands family
and fortunately $unc$four of them live in the same home town
and she has alzheimers
it was getting where she was getting dangerous letting strangers in and things like this
uh-huh
but they were very fortunate
its a small town
and she happens to room with $unc$one of the doctors mothers
and then shes got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
thats good
but she really doesnt
nobody thought she would adjust
but she has adjusted beautifully
that is great
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick
and my mother and father reside in $unc$colorado
shes been taking care of him
i dont know how much longer this can last
and at that point because he requires round the clock
he cant do anything without her
he doesnt know when to take his medicine
and its really sad
and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
my brothers are not interested in helping me
so i would have to move him down here
that way
i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one
where i can go see it
id be very uncomfortable with him being in $unc$colorado
and
why yeah
i am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around $unc$dallas
yes
and some of them are limited care too where people can do
they have apartment styles
but that wouldnt work for him
i think he is beyond that
where if you need help you can get it
but basically people kind of have a small apartment
and doctors are available if they need them
uh-huh
i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in $unc$austin
and allows
yeah
yeah
the only problem with these are that they are very expensive
of course i guess all nursing homes there is
but
and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you have to be a pauper
right
it takes every penny
they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your care
yeah
right
and thats the sad part about it
yeah
i
yeah
and i think a lot of people who do it now
in $unc$colorado its interesting
i talked to my mother
they allow you $unc$sixty $unc$five $unc$thousand dollars and your car and your home
and my mother could make it on that
what she probably would do is disburse the money to me
and then i would send it back to her
so thats what would happen
uh-huh
i think thats what most people do
you just have to give everything away
yeah
its unfortunate
i work at a brokerage firm
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
right
yeah
its frightening
and i guess i dont know how old you are
im $unc$forty-six
were the generation moving into this
and i dont know how our kids are going to take care of us
i cant imagine
im $unc$twenty-nine
yeah
and everybody in my family has always had
we dont have any children
everybody that has has them later in life
yeah
my mother and my father are in their late sixties
so theyre not that far away
right
i also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise
and hes still living at home
and i dont know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are
i know
and so its kind of
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations
but something will have to change as more and more of us get older
luckily if we could be like your grandmother i would love to live to a $unc$hundred and $unc$two if i were okay
but you see these people in their seventies
it
but yeah
most people arent
yeah
most arent
thats the problem
and thats the bad thing
i would hate to have lived so long
she lived by herself
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was $unc$ninety $unc$ninety-one and just did everything
thats incredible
all right have you lived in this area long
no
ive only been here a couple of years
okay
but ive noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
yeah
its a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year you see a little bit more rain
by mid $unc$february we start getting a lot of rain
yeah
yeah
i remember last year we had ice and snow
but it
terrible ice storm around this time of the year
uh-huh
and this year its been so hot and sunny
its really quite amazing
yeah
unseasonable
my wife and i we used to live in $unc$san $unc$antonio couple years ago
uh-huh
and it was i remember the first day of spring
it was so much ice that came down later on that afternoon and evening
yes
it was horrible
i was just talking to my son today
hes up in $unc$boston
and it was $unc$twenty-nine there
and it was in the seventies out here
and it was really
yeah
he really wished he could be here rather than there
yeah
i dont know
i guess im just sort of acclimated to colder weather
really
i like it warmer
i like it warm
but it doesnt really matter
i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
but
uh-huh
uh-huh
i have
i don-
i think its really been delightful
ive spent most of my time in warm weather areas
and the ice and snow just doesnt hold any allure for me at all
i spent $unc$three years in $unc$germany
so im not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
but i got used to it
it was really strange
when we came to $unc$san $unc$antonio it was just swelter
and then we got used to it
and then we went up to $unc$dallas
and it was just
its not that its just hot or dry
its just not very comfortable
it just
her-
do you think $unc$san $unc$antonio is more comfortable than $unc$dallas
yeah
a little bit
uh-huh
yeah
you must
it must be quite a bit hotter down there isnt it
yeah
my wife and i the last day we were in $unc$florida visiting my parents and my brother and sister
we were down there
and the last day right before we left i had to ride with my sister
and the air conditioning went out on the car
wow
and you just get used to air conditioning all the time
yes
and this
it was just
the humidity was like $unc$eighty percent plus
and it was just killing us
yeah
its terrible
$unc$orlando is the only place ive ever been where ive seen the car sweat
yeah
thats really bad
yeah
i guess ive been in some places where the weather was just so mild places like $unc$monterey $unc$california or
uh-huh
uh-huh
just so mild
and then youve been to such extremes like $unc$san $unc$angelo $unc$texas where you walk outside and you sweat
youre sweating
yeah
you look down at your arm
but you see the water leaving your arm
its so hot you just feel it pulling away bizarre
wow
i know i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when its very temperate
yeah
it doesnt
some people say they like to watch the changing of the seasons
but id rather like southern $unc$california have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
yeah
so its kind of a luxury
i tend to agree
but i dont know
i think in some respects it probably more tolerable
yeah
i guess the weather isnt as lively a topic as some of the others we might have gotten
no
the other topics
i got $unc$one topic
they said talk about the $unc$middle $unc$east situ-
i guess were supposed to say good-bye or something and think about what
my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye
we messed up the conversation anyway
ive had i guess some pretty controversial topics
so its just like that was my fault
but then the weathers
man it gets pretty mundane
you can only talk about the situation just so long
yeah
i know
weathers just not all that inspiring
okay
its nice talking to you
okay
bye-bye
bye
being a former drug user i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
whoa
uh-huh
because i know that in using drugs i was not a good employee
uh-huh
and so i can see from the companys standpoint that there
whenever you are an employee of the company you are using its assets
b- you are also under their liability under the workmens $unc$comp
uh-huh
on my job we had a lot of workmens $unc$comp cases
where do you work
oh
and its also a retreading plant
and thats where most of our injuries occur
uh-huh
and what we do is well have a drug test if or a man has an accident
then hes automatically given a drug test
right
do they do it within hours of the accident
or is it
yes
when he goes to the doctor the first time
yeah
and so that kind of
i dont know if its been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it for the past year or so
uh-huh
yeah
weve let some people go that we found that drugs were used in their system
i dont know how $unc$t $unc$e $unc$c would handle it
they havent pursued it
uh-huh
if theres some problem i know
there was $unc$one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
and he went to a separate drug testing firm
yeah
and they showed it negative
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried
yeah
yeah
i think thats probably true too
thats sort of scary
uh-huh
really
and then i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine
yeah
and he tested positive on cocaine
then you always wonder is he just saying that
yeah
yeah
really
really
yeah
yeah
thats a bad situation
i think most companies now as far as entry exams require that
uh-huh
yeah
i think they should
uh-huh
im a $unc$t $unc$i employee
and im really gung ho for it
uh-huh
in fact i
some of the places now like $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m dont allow them smoking in the plant
uh-huh
right
we have designated smoking areas
yeah
but i work in sort of a building thats not really
its on the campus of the $unc$t $unc$i facility
but its a little bit separated
we lease the building
and its a factory environment
uh-huh
and they have designated smoking
but its just wide open
its not ventilated properly
yeah
and i think thats bad
but as far as the drugs being in the factory kind of environment that way i think its essential
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
because youre endangering everybodys lives if its something like that
yeah
in fact weve had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years
uh-huh
and i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to come up
they never called me
they never
and finally the day we declared war was my time
youre kidding
no
and my boss has gone for about $unc$three times i think
and i told him hes obviously in a high risk group
the executives right
right
right
and of course they did specifically single them out when we started that they were going to do all them first
the executives
uh-huh
yeah
wouldnt that be awful if you were using and lose your job and everything
which i thought was interesting
man
yeah
yeah
i cant believe i was so brazen before
like i say im a former drug user
uh-huh
but i accepted $unc$christ as my $unc$lord and $unc$savior
and so i dont use drugs any more
what kind of drugs did you use if you dont mind
marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
wow!
yes
uh-huh
and all on the job too
really
it had gotten that bad
its really lucky that you got away from that
really
cause thats really downward spiral
its
life is so much more enjoyable
uh-huh
and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job
yeah
yeah
thats it
theres all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
yeah
just life in general
uh-huh
thats right
yeah
im definitely for it
yeah
plus you want to think that youre working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life
thats right
in some cases
uh-huh
uh-huh
my husband several years back worked for $unc$motorola
uh-huh
and they had
it was a chemical handling type
goodness
yeah
and they have some serious chemicals out there
yeah
they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water that kind of thing
yeah
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
my gosh
and thats really frightening
yeah
so i think some places like that it should be mandatory on a greater frequency than maybe just paper pushers like i am
uh-huh
right
i would think there would be
youd think so
but
but they werent
i dont know if they do it till yet
isnt that awful
because when he was at
course now its been years now because it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff at $unc$t $unc$i
uh-huh
uh-huh
i forgot what
i guess it was $unc$eighty-four $unc$eighty-five something like that
yeah
and at that time they had no testing whatsoever
so thats scary
yeah
that reminds me of
i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living
and she said hes the supervisor of this chemical land fill where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
lord
oh
and i just went where
yeah
should we move
let me move as far away as possible
ooh
yeah
thats awful
but im proud though that i grew up in the sixties
and back then it was popular
uh-huh
yeah
but people have really become wise about drugs
yeah
and they really have a good campaign for the young people
uh-huh
they know its not smart
so i guess it was just a generational thing
yeah
yeah
peer group is the other way now instead of
thats right
and thats good
uh-huh
thats
thats the best way to stop it
yeah
it really is
yeah
i think we did it
okay
its good talking to you
i enjoyed talking to you $unc$cathy
yeah
bye-bye
okay
are you on any kind of regular exercise plan
i do aerobics step classes and toning classes
step classes
yes
whats that
its a new form i think
its like low impact aerobics
but it
instead of hopping and jumping you just step
uh-huh
yeah
you have a step
and you literally step up on the step and move your arms
its new
its fun
i probably couldnt do that because of my knee
uh-huh
bad knee
yeah
and i do toning a lot and some
every once in a while i play tennis
yeah
im not too great at it
but i try to play
yeah
ive kind of gotten out of the habit myself
its
i guess what i do now is i play softball right now
uh-huh
thats about
right now im on $unc$two teams
so its $unc$four nights a week
gosh
but i enjoy it
but as far as
uh-huh
instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and dont ever hardly use it
uh-huh
ha
right
ye-
i need to make myself do that
yeah
i slacked off a little because of
im about to graduate from college
and so this past couple months have been really hectic
so i havent really gone
and ive really been faithful these past $unc$two months of going to the health club and working out
but
what school you going to
im at $unc$east $unc$carolina
oh
but no
i
my step classes and toning is about the only thing
whats toning
is that lifting weights
its isolated movements for certain muscles groups
okay
you can do with
isometrics stuff like that
yeah
you can do it with weights if you wanted to
but you leave out of there
usually the next morning if you havent done it in a while you wake up the next morning
youre like no
what did i do to myself
and your whole body aches
yeah
i know im looking forward to getting back into getting into shape
i feel like im out of shape
but i feel guilty for not going because im so used to going for $unc$three or $unc$four years now
uh-huh
yeah
i stayed in pretty good shape during school
but
i played baseball all the way through
uh-huh
and working out $unc$six hours a day usually $unc$six or $unc$seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape
yeah
yeah
but ever since i got out of school just jumped right into the job
and i guess the job that im in its stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
because i work some weird hours and do some traveling
uh-huh
no
some
i walk a lot because being in school we
yeah
i dont know if your campus was anything like ours
but our parking lots in $unc$one end of the campus
and the buildings are all at the other end
you ut-
no
i didnt have much of a problem
i guess i went to a small baptist school
and we had about when i was there maybe $unc$thirteen $unc$hundred people
uh-huh
okay
thats if
so its pretty small
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant
uh-huh
yeah
its
i live on the second story apartments
so i walk up and down stairs all day long
weve got a $unc$one story house now
thats enough
i guess i push the lawn mower around
thats fairly regular
yeah
thats $unc$one of the exercise now
yeah
i would like to start running
ive never been much of a runner
but i want to start
i want to run
but i dont know if ill be able to do it
what
just because you dont like to or because you wont be able to
im afraid i wont be able to
if you do aerobics you shouldnt have any problem running
i wish id
yeah
i hope not
we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough
uh-huh
i dont even own a bike
i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about $unc$twelve
i dont know
id be afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike
no
you cant forget how to ride a bike
yeah
but no
i guess thats about the only form
im trying to think of other things that i do that will be considered exercise
yeah
there are things i should do
i know it ju-
when i was going to
i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred
when we were at this junior college our coach
we
$unc$one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics
and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting
uh-huh
so they
it was a regular
we had it for course credit
uh-huh
but still it was pretty high impact stuff
those aerobic classes are tough the high impact
uh-huh
definitely are tough classes
yeah
and shed
most of the guys were all in $unc$one class
so shed kind of lay it on occasionally
uh-huh
first at $unc$eight i think we had
$unc$eight oclock in the morning was our class
uh-huh
wake up
now they have those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for toning instead of using a weight
uh-huh
you have bands
i dont know if youve seen them
yeah
theyre weird
i think my wife has some
theyre just made of i guess its different kinds of rubber
uh-huh
and they get
or sand even some of them
no
theyre elastic
i guess it wouldnt be sand
uh-huh
and theres some that the different colors denotes how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move
i know theres purple gray and green
and some of them are real short
and theyre the ones that are the tough ones to use
yeah
but those classes i enjoy
i think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor thats fun
if you dont have one thats fun and not acting like shes enjoying what shes doing the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class
yeah
if the
are you going to get into instructing
what are you studying
im an interior design major
okay
not in the aerobic instructor type field
oh
no
no
no
no
i could never do that i dont think
id rather just be the student
and occasionally i do the weights at the health club but low weights just
yeah
yeah
some of the $unc$nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting
they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups with those things
uh-huh
but man they are i dont know
to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back
uh-huh
right
i just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines
and you set a speed on it and the weight
and it makes you do it
and it tells you
if youre going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you and stuff like a turtle goes faster
and it tells it
and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you
a little negative reinforcement there while youre going
yeah
do stuff like that
but just ive never used those machines
i just use the regular machines and the free weights like little $unc$five pound hand weights and $unc$eight pound hand weights
yeah
just to do some bicep tricep exercises
sit-ups of course
yeah
thats where im really starting to get noticeable
uh-huh
im just getting real soft in the middle
yeah
i think thats number $unc$one problem with everyone
uh-huh
i havent really started to put on a lot of weight
i guess i probably put on about $unc$nine or $unc$ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about $unc$four years ago
uh-huh
but i just notice myself just real soft
and im sure i dont have near the endurance that i did
yeah
but i keep saying i intend to get back into it
uh-huh
yeah
i just need to put the old nose to the grindstone
i guess at that point it would turn into a task
uh-huh
i dont consider it fun doing that
but
right
yeah
i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend
next weekend
next weekend
all right
yeah
$unc$one week
then i plan to get right back into it
it does a lot for you i think
yeah
makes you feel a lot better
no
yeah
theres no question the end result is great
and i enjoyed
we
when i was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired
uh-huh
and you feel so much better about yourself
yeah
uh-huh
just that you dont feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner
i still dont
but thats a problem
yeah
yeah
good luck on your graduation and your
all righty
thank you
it was nice talking to you
yeah
you too
okay
bye-bye
bye
seems to be a topic thats going to probably take about a generation to catch on it seems or maybe a generation to $unc$two
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up
it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
i wasnt raised as a kid on it
but my kids are
and so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was $unc$one of the first things to do
and we were doing all right there until the price dropped out
and they werent worth anything anymore
uh-huh
and we
it took us almost a year to get a garbage sack full
we just dont drink that many
so as far as at home use well pick up a $unc$six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of $unc$doctor $unc$pepper or something
and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in
at the time it was still about $unc$forty or $unc$fifty cents a pound
and we came out with about a dollar
it just really wasnt worth it
and a lot of hassle all year round
and cans laying
yeah
yeah
they realized
of course to them a dollar was a dollar at $unc$four and $unc$five years old
that was a big deal
but we decided it wasnt worth us keeping it
and then $unc$t $unc$i started keeping up with cans there
so occasionally ill bring whatever ive got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there
least it gets back into the system
but as far as a habit at the house i havent started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
have you all got the individual containers yet
no
i read in the paper this week where maybe
i dont know if it was
i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time
but it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if everything goes that
im not sure all what were going to have to do whether we have $unc$three separate containers
i really dont understand that part on what theyve told you to separate everything
right
yeah
it seemed like
if i recall its been a long time
theyre way behind schedule on that particular part of it
they were fine on the big green containers
uh-huh
but seems like they said they were just going to have a bin
and all different types would go in there
and then that they would sort it as needed
oh
it seemed that there was
at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at the collection sites where everythings clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting
but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses
the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor
so they felt that having $unc$one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it
uh-huh
but i dont know
that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire weeks worth of trash for a house
it would get messy too
yeah
yeah
i know other places when they recycle they have to wash out their glass jars and whatnot which were not in the habit of doing
right
thats true
i was brought up long time ago that they didnt even have cans
they had bottles
and youd return them to the grocery store
right
and youd get our money back
and that was all well and good
they dont seem to still be doing that
if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass
but i guess this day and age they dont
yeah
they dont do that
we live next to a set of railroad tracks
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to break them
uh-huh
but they werent that successful
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
uh-huh
and
yeah
and they p-
i think kids dont appreciate maybe the value of money that its so little that they dont care
they can get more somewhere else
yeah
just a little bit of begging will
for a good
right
theyre
the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarters $unc$fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get the kids just dont seem to care that much about a small amount of money
right
i wonder
but we did buy a can crusher
and we are crushing cans
and we buy the soda when its on sale for $unc$ninety-nine cents
so i would say in the last $unc$three years weve probably used a lot more cans than ever before
yeah
it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat
right
yeah
so thats the main reason we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles
where do you take your cans
as you say it takes a while to build it up
since weve had the crusher all summer i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we havent ta-
i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a recycling place probably at $unc$one of the li-
hello $unc$lynn
yes
okay
do you have any pets
yes
i have a dog and cat now
what are their names
$unc$tibby and $unc$liberty
which is the dog and which is the cat
$unc$tibby is the dog
and $unc$liberty is the cat
wife and i we have $unc$two cats
oh
ones real nice
but the other $unc$one is a
shes pretty wild
ours are pretty calm
yeah
are they just house pets
uh-huh
yeah
thats what ours are too
yeah
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep
so thats why we call her $unc$liberty
really
thats a nice story
do you want to hear about my other animals ive had
sure
sure
ive had a skunk
yeah
ive had a burmese python
ive had rats
ive had mice
wow
lets see
ive had gerbils
i had a son hes now gone from the home that was an animal lover
uh-huh
so at $unc$one point i had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
wow
the skunk was it kind of like a cat to have around the house
yes
yeah
it was litter trained
yeah
and we had it perfumed
uh-huh
and it was very aggressive
right
but all $unc$three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house
uh-huh
and the skunk
and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa
yeah
nobody came near it when he was there
oh
i had a dog $unc$one time
and he chased after a skunk and got sprayed
oh
so we had to give him a tomato juice bath and get him cleaned up
yeah
ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them
but the glands had been removed
uh-huh
right
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready
right
yeah
why i dont know
i think theyre kind of nice to have
theyre kind of just relaxing to pet and to
i dont know
when they sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to have
i dont know
something giving you some affection as well
yeah
i always said if i died id come back as a dog
what do you think
yeah
yeah
thatd be the best way to be
yeah
do you like big dogs or little dogs
we had a german $unc$shepherd
and he had dysplasia
uh-huh
and he had it for about $unc$three or $unc$four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
really
when he died we got a little one
yeah
but our $unc$shepherd was almost $unc$thirteen years old
and it just was almost cruel because
uh-huh
almost cruel for him to walk
yeah
he couldnt get up
he couldnt walk
he was a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty pounds
so it was a chore
yeah
so we said the next time around wed get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
sure
yeah
and then weve had $unc$three cats in our married life
and weve got a calico now
yeah
weve got a calico cat too
do you
yeah
yeah
shes the nice $unc$one
we used to live in an apartment
and our cats never went outside
but the neighbors used to let their dogs out
and our neighbors were i dont know kind of slimy
and our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in
so we had to flea bath them
and it was an experience that they didnt enjoy at all
yeah
dont even talk to me
when i was single i had gone away for the weekend
yeah
and my husband then $unc$fianc3e was to keep my cat
and he let her out
and my house was loaded with fleas
you walked in
and your legs were just black
really
and we had such a time and never got the cat back
really
yeah
i found it in the street
oh
i was a social worker at the time and found it
now is it $unc$stacy
$unc$angie
$unc$angie
im sorry
okay
if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make
lets see
i like seafood
lets see
shrimp steamed shellfish with maybe herbs
spicy lobster with linguini
that sounds good
yeah
what is the steamed shellfish you said
uh-huh
and what would that be like a clam or
right
okay
yeah
i think $unc$hors $unc$doeuvres are good too
and that way you can have a variety
so if you have a dinner party and youre going to serve seafood for supper what type of $unc$hors $unc$doeuvres would you serve prior to the meal
cheeses or fruits or vegetables or
yeah
fresh vegetables would be good
or just
probably not nachos and dip
no
and would it be appropriate to drink when you have the $unc$hors $unc$doeuvres
yeah
yeah
okay
and then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood
all these hard questions
what white wine
that would be my guess
yeah
and then dessert
im not really a drinker
so i dont know a lot about that
something sweet
goodness
chocolate something chocolate
you must like chocolate
yes
lets see
usually when we have a dinner party i like to grill
you do
we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese
$unc$one of our favorites is to take some lets see $unc$philadelphia cream cheese i think is that what comes in those little blocks and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and wash them and cool them and then dump them in the sauce and then take crackers
uh-huh
yeah
and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail
and then i like to barbecue steaks or pork chops
and then lot of times well have baked potatoes with them and a salad
uh-huh
and then i dont know what we usually have for dessert
cake sometimes
but thats what we would do for a dinner party i guess
that sounds good too
but thats more for when friends come over
traditional
right
traditional
yeah
yeah
i wouldnt be the big snotty kind
i just really started learning about that
and i bought a $unc$martha $unc$stewart
i dont know if youve heard of her
huh-uh
her cookbook
and she talks about catering and goes into all that and the different types of parties different types of foods
do you work in a setting where you are in the food business
my father owns a restaurant
is it in $unc$dallas
its just a cafe
so its not really anything that i want to
its not the same
its in $unc$lewisville
okay
all right
you graduated from which high school
$unc$trinity
$unc$trinity
okay
and thats a public school or private
thats public
okay
i have to get to know this area a little better i guess
is your fathers cafe one that you could cater out of
no
uh-huh
its not
and hes not interested in letting his $unc$twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably
lets see
what else for catering
lets see
what about hawaiian luau
that would be good
could have fruits and pineapple
lets see
and you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to
i think decorating your food is really
we have a $unc$sheltie $unc$collie a miniature $unc$sheltie
do you
yeah
its about $unc$six months old
and were try-
we live in an apartment
so we dont have a yard
so it has to stay inside
and were having a difficult time trying to train it
how old is it
its about $unc$six months
youre in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think
really
but theyre supposed to be real intelligent dogs
but i guess every once in a while you get $unc$one thats not so intelligent because this $unc$one it
i dont know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the training bit
ive had dogs through the years
right now ive got $unc$two and $unc$three cats
and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a $unc$sheltie mix
and we watched it this summer for $unc$two to $unc$three months
and it wasnt trained quite fully either
uh-huh
but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
yeah
how do you
whats the best method
i dont know
im old fashioned
and when i got my dogs when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside
right
they say thats not the way to do it now
youre just supposed to
stand outside with them until they
no
just put them outside i guess unless you catch them in the act
were hardly ever at home
so its kind of difficult
yeah
and you dont want to spank it or scare it or anything like that
so
no
no
you dont want to do that
but
yeah
we try to take it
it gets frustrating when you take it outside
and then it runs right inside
does it just want to sniff around
does it just want to sniff around and play when its outside
yeah
a lot of times
and it wont its little job outside
yeah
and it comes inside
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside
yeah
weve tried that
and theres certain spots in the house where he likes to go
yeah
and he chews on plants and all that
but thats natural for a little puppy
thats nothing
itll catch on pretty soon ill bet you
i have a almost $unc$sixteen year old $unc$golden $unc$retriever
and shes gone the other way
because shes so old she doesnt have much control
really
so were battling with that problem
thats sad
and she still feels good
she cant hear worth a darn or see very well
but shes got a great appetite
and she knows were there by smell
how old is it
shell be $unc$sixteen in $unc$may
man thats sad
and yeah
but we cant bear to do anything because shes been our friend for all these years
of course not
so were putting up with all her accidents
i couldnt
and the la-
$unc$two nights ago she had diarrhea
and so that was a bad one
but i think were buying a carpet shampooer this weekend
that is really sad
whats the deal
were trying to take it on walks now
uh-huh
and we cant because its not accustomed to being on a leash
yeah
and so this dog really feels like its being killed or something when you try to tug on it to walk it
it just goes like a mad dog
it just jumps up and down and starts yapping
and its not even close to even being trained on a leash
does it
uh-huh
maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
uh-huh
weve heard some bad things about some of those
they sometimes misuse their license or whatever
oh
they treat them bad
we went to the junior college $unc$richland
really
and we took
my daughter was living at home then
and she took the $unc$norwegian $unc$elk $unc$hound over there
really
and its a pretty good class
and they did pretty good except this dog is
shes just pretty
shes not smart
uh-huh
so she didnt learn a lot
but i think it calmed her down a little bit
and shes used to being around other dogs now
how long did it take
i think it was a $unc$six week program
every what
i think it was $unc$one night a week for $unc$six weeks
really
and it was a group class outside
it was fairly reasonable too
$unc$sheltie $unc$collies are timid
and they dont really
unless they get used to something theyre really nervous
and
yeah
theyre usually a high-strung dog arent they
yeah
yeah
and if theyre not accustomed to something theyre really scared
so
our friend has a
the topic is hobbies
in your spare time
yeah
who has spare time
i dont really do any handicraft things like that
i used to do salt ornaments and things
uh-huh
but that was good many years ago
and my spare time
yeah
i usually go do aerobics and read
and thats about it
yeah
yeah
i understood that
i work full time
and i have $unc$two kids
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids
yeah
hobbies
i cant really say that we have hobbies
its more like maybe projects or something on the weekend
we like to go out
yeah
family
thats what i meant by salt that we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it during the $unc$christmas season making them up for other people and things like that
oh
uh-huh
right
but as far as
uh-huh
ive just never been very skilled at far needle work cloths
uh-huh
and the things ive tried to do just dont look very good
and
i guess mostly as far as crafts go ive done some needlepoint
ive done mostly cross stitching
i used to do
$unc$one that i did for both kids are
theyre plaques with different kind of animals
and then you have their birth date on them
yeah
and then you have a little picture of them
and you frame them and stuff
uh-huh
but nothing steady
just when i get some spare time here and there ill work on it
but its nothing that i can really
its not like you sit and knit every night
no
not at all
yeah
i dont even know how to knit
and my mother used to knit all the time
uh-huh
and i dont even know how to knit
im like thats a lost art from this family
yeah
but its not a very good topic
it feels like if
no
not when youre n-
neither $unc$one of us are really
i have seen things i really like that were done especially like needlepoint
uh-huh
needlepoint cushions and things
yeah
but it just seems like thered be so much time involved in it and that the petty point and things like that
yeah
god it seems like its easier just to go out and buy it already made
i dont know what is its like there
but here a lot of the country stuff is in a lot of the woodwork a lot of stenciling
yeah
and you can go to a flea market and stuff
and theres just tons of stuff everywhere
and people just do it in their garage
yeah
and then on weekends they go out and sell it
and during the week they go back and do some more
and they do that as their job whereas for us it
right
and they make it cheaper for us to buy
yeah
definitely
and im sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
because i can remember when i used to do those figurines and things
it was relaxing creative
you felt very creative
uh-huh
but it just was so much time involved and the different steps and things
yeah
uh-huh
and
okay
i think were okay
i think we did the $unc$five minutes
so we dont have to keep talking about nothing anymore
yeah
okay
thank you
okay
i hope you have a good rest of your weekend
thanks
bye-bye
okay
bye-bye
where are you from $unc$tina
im from $unc$maryland
and i have $unc$one son whos almost $unc$sixteen months old
are you married or
yeah
uh-huh
you are
i have $unc$two children
i have a $unc$seven year old and a $unc$three year old
oh
so i try to spend as much time as possible with them
thats good
what kind of things do you do
we do a lot of things with them
$unc$taylor my youngest is
or my oldest is in school
and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that
oh
was it a big change in your life to have a child
yeah
yeah
its really nice
my husband is working most of the time
hes working long hours
but im staying home
uh-huh
uh-huh
im just working a couple days a month
and
uh-huh
what do you do during those days
we spend a lot of time at the playground
and we go to the zoo
and we go
and we wa-
you said you worked a couple days a month though
yeah
yeah
what do you do
im a nurse
are you
yeah
its real easy to work out my schedule to still stay in with that and to have enough time to spend with $unc$matthew
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
hes just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things
yeah
i understand that
yeah
they really grow up quick especially at that early age
yeah
but my wife was
she worked part-time when my oldest was little
and now shes staying home all the time
but that worked out really well because its a big transition i think to have children
yeah
to go from nothing
if you want to do something every night thats fine
but when you have children it doesnt work that way anymore
thats right
and i think a lot of people are realizing that
but still there are so many people that have their careers first
and i think its really hurting the kids
yeah
yeah
but
yeah
i agree with you
i think that my wife leaned that way
and im really glad she did
and im glad shes staying home
but i know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work
i know
thats why i like to work a couple days
i think it gives me a break
yeah
yeah
well thats why im glad my wife did too
cause she worked either $unc$two to $unc$three days a week
and that got her out of the house
and yet shed get to spend $unc$three or $unc$four days with
most of the time at home
yeah
yeah
yeah
and so
we had started out like that
and i think that was really ideal
yeah
i do to
i agree
but then when you start having $unc$two of them its a little bit tougher because youve got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff
its
yeah
yeah
yeah
its difficult
but
are you from the $unc$maryland area
uh-huh
ive lived here forever
really
yeah
i live in $unc$germantown
and
where are you from
im in $unc$dallas $unc$texas
in $unc$dallas
oh
yeah
ive lived here like $unc$eight years or so
my wifes from $unc$fort $unc$worth
yea-
but
yeah
i work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
okay
oh
so that explains
yeah
that explains it doesnt it
i dont know
we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family
yeah
yeah
but as far as during the week its usually just my son and i
and were
yeah
whats your husband do
he works for $unc$coca $unc$cola
uh-huh
he manages a plant out here
oh
and it takes a lot of time
yeah
im sure it does
but it
we take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that
uh-huh
yeah
but
yeah
what
my wife did some teaching at a private tutoring place a $unc$sylvan $unc$learning $unc$center this year
oh
and so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff cause normally if they need something they just go to $unc$mom no matter what it is
oh
yeah
im perfectly capable of doing it for them
but its so much easier to go to $unc$mom
right
i guess they get used to it
but wed go to the library and do things like that
yeah
but
thats good
thats good
i know my husband was real
in the beginning when he was transferred to a larger plant
and he works about an hour and a half away from our home
uh-huh
so it takes him a little bit of time
yeah
and im not able to work during the week because of that
i was working in the evening
uh-huh
and he was coming home
and i could go to work
but their relationship when i was able to work in the evenings really grew
yeah
uh-huh
he
just the time that they were spending together
yeah
i think it really helped to have that time together
uh-huh
it really does
because i think you grow closer
was your husband naturally a child
had he been around children
or
yeah
he has $unc$seven other brothers and sisters
oh
and we have $unc$thirteen grand
his parents have $unc$thirteen grandchildren
uh-huh
so theres a lot of kids in the family
and he really enjoys it
yeah
yeah
but right now its kind of a difficult time
but
yeah
and the cost of living here is just so tremendously outrageous
yeah
yeah
its difficult to do it any other way
yeah
i understand
yeah
i
its hard because
then youre not getting to spend as much time at home
your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as hed want to
thats right
yeah
thats a tough situation
but then again some
you got to do what you got to do to get along too
yeah
yeah
yeah
at least i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home
it
uh-huh
like i said my wife normally feels that way
there are days when i come home and she says here take these kids
im getting out
i know
so shes had about enough during those days
but for the most part ive really feel like thats led
i know
the way that we- jus-
like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people cant afford to get by on just $unc$one salary and wont
yeah
yeah
and so i think thats tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially
yeah
it has
and i really think that thats $unc$one of the problems the nations facing that we need to do something about
but i dont know what
i believe that too
and i think the kids are where they need to
yeah
they need to really focus on the children in this country
yeah
would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think
no
i didnt even really think about it that much
uh-huh
i was vaguely aware of it
but it wasnt really that important to me
and
uh-huh
its amazing how your whole focus on life changes after youve had a child
it really does
i
just the whole
seeing how you really are forming the mind
uh-huh
in the next year or so youll see so many instances where hell mimic something that youve done
and everything im doing hes learning from
thats right
and you think if i wasnt here hed be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care
yeah
thats how theyre developing their patterns
and i think a lot of people either dont care or dont realize it
thats
or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
yeah
ive seen a lot of people just say hell learn everything when he gets into
yeah
eventually
yeah
its true
but it
i know
even just this first year that ive been with my son here hes
i can just see how much of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
plus i think it becomes part of you too
you get to stay home
its not just for him
but its also for you because youre both kind of bonding together there too i think
yeah
thats true
its been nice talking to you
its nice talking to you too
okay
good luck
okay
okay
good-bye
$unc$lynn do you want to start
certainly
okay
do you want to tell me about summer vacations youve taken
or
i tend to take $unc$two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that
uh-huh
which is your favorite
i couldnt live without the family vacations
but my favorite is the indulgent ones where we go off and see places that have interested me since i was a kid for the most part
uh-huh
and
your family doesnt live close then
not anymore
theyve been in $unc$san $unc$diego for the last few years
and theyre moving to $unc$florida
okay
and thats $unc$one of those things
you just have to go once a year
yep
i understand
basically it sorts out into that
and then about once every $unc$three or $unc$four years i try to get over to $unc$england because i lived there for a while some years back
wow
ive only been there once
oh
and id love to go back
beautiful country
beautiful country
and it was
beautiful people
yeah
it
but
and id really like to go because im fairly recently married
we had a great time
and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
but hes never met them
so id like to do that
but thats our typical vacation
and we enjoy the family vacations
but the other ones are very special getaways
and we probably take $unc$one of each every year
how about yourself
we as you do take family vacations sometimes $unc$one a year
but this year were not going to be taking $unc$one for several reasons
but vacations we really enjoy
i think weve been on $unc$three cruises
ive never been on a cruise
and we really love cruises
weve gone on $unc$carnival $unc$cruise $unc$lines
uh-huh
and weve gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go
we usually book just a month before its ready to go
yeah
and we get upgraded
last $unc$two times in fact we had an outside room
and it was beautiful
and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around
its kind of
what do you do on a cruise
ive never been on a cruise
my $unc$god you do everything
you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be
you can sit in the sun all day around the pool
or you can take part in the games that they have going on
they always have bingo
they have a casino
they have a massage parlor
they have exercise
you can do anything
and thats just aboard ship
and then when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping
uh-huh
and thats quite fun
uh-huh
and where have you been on these cruises
$unc$nassau $unc$san $unc$juan $unc$saint $unc$thomas
weve been there twice
we went $unc$two cruises that hit those islands but with different people
weve gone with friends each time
i see
and then we went to the western $unc$caribbean which is $unc$port $unc$cancun $unc$cozumel and $unc$ocho $unc$rios
the mexican coast
pardon me
thats all $unc$mexico i think
yes
uh-huh
but it was wonderful
so we really like those
and i guess we just like to go someplace entirely different
weve been to a few places in this country
we still have a lot to see though
where are you from originally
were from $unc$illinois originally
uh-huh
and weve been down in $unc$texas $unc$eighteen years
and so like you we always try to make it back home to see the relatives
we both still have family there
uh-huh
and thats fun
it brings back a lot of memories
yes
things are different there though
theyre
i dont know
its just entirely different world than this area
i grew up in $unc$dallas
so its not like im going home
did you
my parents retired first to $unc$san $unc$diego
uh-huh
and theyre going now to $unc$florida
and so theyre going very nice places
thank $unc$god
uh-huh
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know
i really came to love $unc$san $unc$diego and feel very comfortable there
theyve been there $unc$eight years
uh-huh
and i just grab the car and drive everywhere
thats great
it is nice
but its not home
this is home
and ive never thought about a cruise
its so funny
they really are
as i said weve done them $unc$three times
wed be going again this year if circumstances hadnt changed
wed probably go
uh-huh
my husband would
the minute i said the word hes chomping at the bit
he kind of likes the casinos a little bit
uh-huh
but i like all of that
whats the best part from your point of view
i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places
uh-huh
i like shopping
i can shop anyplace shop in $unc$london and $unc$france and wherever
now my kids are moving to $unc$toronto
so were going to be able to go up there
that will be nice
so im kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
sure
but
sure
dont go in the winter
thats what everybody says
and i think its
i think ill try to stay away except my second grandchild will be born in the winter in $unc$january
oh
so that will be hard to stay away from
there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
yeah
but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of $unc$texas in the summer
isnt that the truth
uh-huh
that sounds wonderful
i guess i would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it
theres all age groups too
and thats kind of fun
if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people
uh-huh
you may meet people $unc$thirty years older than you or younger
and everybody is really interesting
and everybody is there to have a good time
and
how long are the cruises
weve only gone on the $unc$seven day cruises
uh-huh
they have shorter ones
and then they have $unc$ten day ones
but i think $unc$seven days is long enough for us
by that time were ready to get home and get back to our routine
yeah
i think most vacations $unc$seven days is enough for us
weve gone
i think when we went to $unc$england and $unc$france we were there $unc$ten $unc$twelve days
and that was pushing it a bit
yeah
i tend when i spend enough money to go overseas i go for a long time
yeah
that makes sense it really does
we went to $unc$panama too
thats interesting
went to $unc$panama last $unc$august
uh-huh
our son-in-law is from $unc$panama
oh
and we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there
uh-huh
and his father is a doctor
and his mother is a kindergarten teacher
and they took time off
it was their winter
and they were having a little break
so they took some time off that they could show us around
and it is a beautiful country
it is beautiful
they have mountains
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
thats really nice
and it is gorgeous
they live in a small town called $unc$david which is northern $unc$panama up near $unc$costa $unc$rica
uh-huh
and its just a gorgeous country
most people dont realize it
i think if they could get tourists coming to their country theyd improve the economy considerably
maybe now things are calming down again that will happen
yeah
we really hope so
thats really great
yeah
as i said basically all ive done is go back and forth to parents
and
thats pretty good
thats pretty good
and my husband had a conference in $unc$l $unc$a
so we spent a week in $unc$l $unc$a
and of course
do you like $unc$l $unc$a
im very unusual
i like
you ready
yeah
okay
what have you seen lately
its funny when i tried to make the call the other days
i thought
i hadnt seen anything since dances with wolves
but today i went to see regarding with $unc$henry
im dying to see that
it was really good
we
oh
$unc$jeff $unc$wariner just got out of the hospital
uh-huh
and $unc$jeff and $unc$deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood
and we all liked it
we had both moms and $unc$fifteen year olds and a $unc$twelve year old
and everyone enjoyed it
my goodness
and
i am just dying to see it
i went to dinner with some friends last weekend
and they said get a baby-sitter
and well all go see regarding $unc$henry
yeah
and i said ooh i want to see it so bad
my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and $unc$one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see
oh
and so since he had this friend up from $unc$houston and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this i thought i want to see this one too
i
yeah
finally its my first summer movie
my
let me see
was it
we went to see $unc$one $unc$hundred and $unc$one dalmatians last weekend
and that may be
no
right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on
were going to the movies
and we wont
she goes all the time
but i go maybe once every couple of months
yeah
and when i go i go see $unc$two at a time
so we went to see soapdish
and
was that good
cause
hysterical
we laughed so hard
it was just you couldnt hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard
yeah
i want to see that and city slickers both
i love comedies
yeah
but thats what i was
thats the other one that we went to that night
was it
and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love $unc$billy $unc$crystal
and course growing up on the back of a horse and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true
and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles
it was so funny
both of them were great
good
im glad to hear that because they
they are
we just laughed so hard
and like i said with soapdish it is so cornball
and it is so overacted that youre just hysterical
uh-huh
they just carried it off to the tee
i dont know if you got to see weekend at bernies that was out a couple of years ago
no
they had a free showing at the $unc$berkeley $unc$united $unc$artist
how neat
and i dont know who was here or whether $unc$jay called a friend
and we didnt think wed have much chance of getting in
but we thought wed try it free movie
shoot
yeah
it was so funny and it sounds like what you were just describing soapdish too
we hurt by the time we came out
yeah
and the whole theater was hysterical
and its just goofy
its
if you have a chance to rent it at least
or it should be out on t v i would think
yeah
i think it is
i think it is
cause its just a fun summer light comedy
make your cheeks hurt laughing
especially in the theater it was contagious
yeah
i imagine the way soapdish was but with everyone laughing
gosh
i never laughed
and people were just screaming and applauding
and it was just hysterical
im glad you did that before your surgery
me too because i dont even know if i could live through it now
yeah
im getting around real good
and im just still real sore
yeah
and today course i went back to work $unc$two weeks after
gosh
but i dont have permanent work
right now im working with a temporary agency
and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free
oh
so i went up to do $unc$wordperfect cause that seems like thats what everybody wants
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
yeah
and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day
and i said yeah
and i went
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that
and i worked about $unc$three days a week ever since $unc$two to $unc$three days a week
and so i went to my doctors last $unc$thursday
and this was my fourth week checkup
and he said gosh youre just healing really well
i just cant get over this
he says in $unc$two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things
if you want to play ball you can go play ball
he says im not going to say youre going to feel like playing ball
but you can if you want to
yeah
and he was teasing me
and he says yeah
youll be out there waterskiing
i can just see it now
and he says so you just take it easy for $unc$two more weeks
youve only got $unc$two more weeks
i said okay fine i will
whatever you call easy ill do it
and ive been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
yeah
yeah
and so im real glad that we didnt go see those funny ones when im still sort of on the sore side
yeah
but
whats your next
have you seen $unc$robin $unc$hood yet
no
that was $unc$one $unc$jay got to see with a friend
and so i
and to try and find time its hard with jims schedule too just to get a time that we can both go
yeah
and im holding out for city slickers for the $unc$two of us because we had friends that went to see that and said its just perfect for our age group
uh-huh
because i think he needs a comedy too
and thats what he would have liked to have seen regarding $unc$henry too
but knew that
weve got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful
were really enjoying it
but some of the different things were doing theres just not enough time to do it all
uh-huh
and realistically he knew he couldnt get them all in
yeah
but $unc$jay really liked $unc$robin $unc$hood
when the choir group went to see backdraft they thought it was funny cause he sounded like the critics
he said the plot line and the characters arent real big
but the fire scenes and that action part is fantastic
uh-huh
but he thought $unc$robin $unc$hood was great
it was real different then youd expect
but he enjoyed it
really
and so
i went
course i am a $unc$kevin $unc$costner fan
yeah
me too
and yeah
supreme
i really like him a lot which is why dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months
uh-huh
but
gosh was that wonderful
it was
i
in fact a friend from $unc$germany was visiting in $unc$march
and we didnt ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it
we were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it too
yeah
i just thought that was terrific
and i really enjoy $unc$harrison $unc$ford which is $unc$one of the reasons i wanted to see
i do too
i think hes really good
and hes very good in regarding $unc$henry
thats not an easy part to play i dont think
i wouldnt think
my kids are going to their dads tomorrow night
so i sort of think i may go do that
yeah
that $unc$one wont your sides
good
it
was this the first time you got to see $unc$one $unc$hundred and $unc$one dalmatians
or
i hav-
my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between $unc$ashley and jamies age
uh-huh
and we went to the
push my number
okay
okay
are you a golfer
or are you a spectator
im a
i play golf
but i dont actually play golf
im the same way
i go out there and hit the ball
yeah
hack it all over the place
yeah
its sickening isnt it
in the $unc$carolinas its just weve got a bunch of golf courses around here
yeah
weve got tons up here
but i dont know
how do you feel about your game
i guess thats a good question
im not a serious golfer at all
a friend of mine goes golfing a lot
and he drags me out every now and then
and i dont really even have a game
i usually
when i go out and play golf its usually like at $unc$one of these par threes that you
yeah
but i like watching it on t v
yeah
i like that too
i dont know
i try to play
but god a couple years ago i played $unc$two $unc$three times a week and got lousy
i guess thats the best i ever got was lousy
and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come
and then i got worse again
so
to get me they say i hit worm burners because i cant hit it up in the air
yeah
im pretty bad
but i get great distance hitting it across the ground
and if its going over water or something $unc$one of them have to take the shot for me because im
but im getting better
ive got where now i can hit it in the air some of the time
thats pretty good
yeah
so im kind of a novice at it
im that and worse
i play
next year i
actually i take it kind of seriously
but ive been doing so bad
i always say this every year but next year im starting over from scratch
im going to go take lessons and everything
im going to do it right and see if i can actually play this game or not
i guess thats what i need to do is get some kind of lessons or something
because my tee off is not bad
im good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
its just that initial tee
yeah
what do you do when youre putting
thats a good thing
thats something i could learn actually
thats when i do my worst
i finally get to the green
and i think im doing all fine
and then
just walking around the hollow and making sure theres not really
checking the ground and so forth
yeah
see how its going to break or whatever
can you really see it though
yeah
what about the speed
if you get down on the ground you really can
but can you tell how fast youre going to hit it
you know if its up on a slope that youve got to hit it not kill it
but youve got to hit enough speed and the right angle that its
because when its going up a hill its going to break in a direction
yeah
but you can feel that
yeah
i dont know
i can get it within $unc$four or $unc$five feet or something
but i dont have enough field
now im t v watching
yeah
they make you die at the hole every time
yeah
it just dies and rolls in
i dont know
but i
its hard for me
the
its like i said
once i get up on the green im fine
but that tee shot it
when teeing off ill go probably a $unc$hundred feet across the ground
so it takes me awhile to get to the hole
but
once youre there youre all set though
im all set
we should play team golf then
ill get us there
and you put it in
that sounds good to me
i s-
the $unc$t $unc$v golfers they do that
it takes them $unc$two to get there and $unc$two to get it in
so its $unc$fifty percent
and me it takes me $unc$five to get there and $unc$five to get it in
it usually takes me about probably $unc$two or $unc$three to get it there
and then thats according to the hole
and it ju-
maybe $unc$one or $unc$two putts
its according to where im at on the green
yeah
thats good
but the friends i play with they play all the time
and theyre really good
$unc$joe pros
theyre not $unc$joe pros
but they golf in the high sixties low seventies
so i guess theyre pretty good
thats pretty good
for $unc$eighteen
yeah
for $unc$eighteen
wow
thats pretty good
yeah
im talking to the wrong guy
your shitty golf is probably the best golf ive ever seen
no
no
no
thats not my golf
thats my friends
mine
im usually in the eighties or nineties
so im not good
when im in the nineties im feeling good
im usually around a $unc$hundred
thats my thing around a $unc$hundred
i can hit a great drives and think im going to do all awesome on this hole
but it aint going to happen
teeing off i either slice it
or i hook it ever single time
and i alternate
its a good thing with me i slice it every single time
thats good
i aim
okay
okay
universal health insurance
right
thats right
what would we like to say
i think
uh-huh
i think thats what the subject is about
did you read the article in the paper today about this particular subject
in the $unc$morning $unc$times
yeah
i guess i did not
the state of $unc$washington and the state of $unc$minnesota is going to begin testing a state funded program for citizens of those $unc$two states
and theres $unc$fourteen other states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning
i think its a trend thats probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need
its getting to a point that you have to have it
you have to have some form of health insurance
its been interesting that we
extremely expensive though
yes
we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
uh-huh
and yet i dont think weve ever quite decided whos really supposed to pay for it
thats the thing
unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are paying for the people that dont have health insurance
which is why people are talking about
we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way thats more fair
yeah
i dont think you
you have health insurance
yes
i do
through your company
through my company
yes
but i have been in a situation recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year
and my wife developed cancer
we didnt have any insurance
my goodness
and it was a go to $unc$parkland type situation
thats must have been hard
how was your care at $unc$parkland
because it was a life threatening situation it was very good
as it turned out $unc$one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at $unc$parkland
but yet $unc$parkland is not free either
no
its not free
but its a situation that because i didnt have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county
is it affordable
you did have a good experience
i had a bad experience as it turned out
i was fortunate that there was $unc$parkland
is your wife better i hope
no she passed away
im real sorry
thats all right
sure
that happens
it does happen
but its very sad
yeah
but in any event im in favor of national health if i had to vote for it
so am i
actually im a pediatrician
is that right
and i feel very strongly about children and developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year where we certainly proved that were not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most
uh-huh
uh-huh
so im really quite active in trying to be proactive at least for childrens issues
its very complicated
but i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits
when i grew up and
i grew up in south central $unc$kansas
we had
and my mom worked for the county health department
and we had x-rays every year
we had a dentist come to our school and check our teeth once a year at least
we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff
and when my children were growing up we didnt have that
we had to pay for it which i wasnt opposed to paying for it
i had the money to pay for it
but im sure that there were people that dont
and so much has gone up so much
the cost of immunizations for example and just the legal benefits
that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily $unc$et $unc$cetera
uh-huh
i dont know
it is interesting
in case you didnt know $unc$texas leads the nation in uninsured children
$unc$thirty-one percent of all $unc$texas children do not have insurance and are not on $unc$medicaid
did not know that
so $unc$one out of every $unc$three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care
and i work in the childrens $unc$parkland system
and its pretty overwhelming to me
uh-huh
but its pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in $unc$dallas county
okay
now what are your opinions on recycling
i definitely think that we need to start recycling
i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until
i think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late
yeah
i have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year $unc$two $unc$thousand
yeah
i have heard that too
and that is not too far away
but i dont know how it is there
it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much
i take my paper
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
uh-huh
and i can take plastic milk cartons or if they have water in them
and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to
and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
i started saving newspapers
and i would take a ton of them
uh-huh
and i cant remember where i went to take them
but they wouldnt take them
yeah
it is real hard to find a spot
and then i dont know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible
bottles
i know
glass
it could be recycled
but there is no place to
there is no really recycling facilities
no
we have a pilot program in $unc$arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they have people separate the trash as they put it out
i think that is a good idea
and i think that is what it is going to have to come to where we are just forced to
besides a law or whatever
an- thats how it is in $unc$new $unc$york isnt it
yeah
i think so
just because they have to
uh-huh
and you get ticketed if you dont do it right
right
uh-huh
and i think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the
its trouble for me to do what i do
yeah
i am willing to do it
but
plus you have to have a place to store all of it
yeah
and i live in an apartment
yeah
it is very difficult
our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
and so i dont know
i think there needs to be more places
and also i have a real strong opinion
in $unc$iowa the state i am from i believe it has gone up to a dollar now
uh-huh
every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether its a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay $unc$ten cents for it
yeah
and then you take it back to the store
and you get it back
so that way it kind of forces you to recycle
you are forced to
and you also dont see the litter there
people just
yeah
thats true
it makes it worthwhile to take it back
and ive just started drinking a new water called $unc$clearly $unc$canadian
i dont know if youve tried it
yeah
i have seen them
and they have on the ba- that they pay $unc$five cents
uh-huh
and it even shows the states that
that take them back
yeah
some of them are $unc$five some are $unc$ten cents
i am looking at it right now
is $unc$texas $unc$one of them
$unc$texas is not $unc$one of them
so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
yeah
no
i dont think that there is enough being done
i work at $unc$j $unc$c $unc$penny at their corporate headquarters
uh-huh
and we have a paper recycling program that is company wide
and i do the recycling for that
do they save the paper they use at the office paper
yeah
good
because there is a lot of waste there isnt there
yeah
and i know there is a lot of computer paper that you cant use
right
right
but we use to have
i dont even remember the money that theyve made from the recycling program
they have donated it to charities
right
they have made a substantial amount of money from it
yeah
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage
i have decided $unc$downy $unc$fabric $unc$softener now has where you can buy a little carton
yeah
you add wa-
i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later
but i am going to stick with $unc$downey because they were first
yeah
and i want them to have my business
and i think packaging could be done much better
there is so much plastic
but
i know
you see some of the stuff
and then when they come out with the new things you are like why didnt you think of that before
yeah
yeah
and i think that its just people have got to be aware
unfortunately there are a lot of people that just dont care
and they dont want to think about it
yeah
thats true
and i just look at it i dont want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didnt you do something
i want to feel like i at least tried
yeah
and i dont know
it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it
then we will be forced to
it may be too late
i mean i dont know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like
very little
thats another thing that
there were no
then thats pollution
i know $unc$amway
i use a couple of things from $unc$amway that it says this is burnable material
that doesnt do me any good because i dont have any place to burn it
yeah
i know
i guess you run into the pollution factor
yeah
and then just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle i can get $unc$ten cents but not in $unc$texas
yeah
and there is no place i can take glass to
so i still throw away a lot of glass
it is really sad
yeah
and then the packaging thing really grips me
you buy some
and its got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
okay $unc$mary
yes
the latest $unc$one ive seen had to do with basically a manhunt
and it was called manhunter actually
the guy apparently had a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people just kill them with as much blood and guts as possible
how awful
it was truly awful
it was not one that i picked
but it did show some interesting things about the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i
because the characters trying to get him were $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i people
and of the few good things that were in it it did show a lot about the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i about the training and how they go through training and how they try to develop a mental picture of who theyre looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that
and it was pretty telling about the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i and their procedures
i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction
yeah
i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i going i guess
yeah
they keep it rather secretive
yes
yeah
yeah
the most recent movie i saw im afraid was
$unc$two of them actually
the rain man was $unc$one
that was great $unc$one
wasnt that fabulous
and driving $unc$miss $unc$daisy
i loved it
i havent seen that $unc$one yet
and i need to go see it
you need to see that
yeah
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between $unc$two people $unc$two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that $unc$one was jewish and $unc$one was black
uh-huh
and this all took place in the $unc$south
my
and normally never the twain shall meet
you bet especially in the $unc$south
yes
right
and it really was a fantastic movie
the acting was phenomenal
as i recall it got some $unc$academy $unc$awards didnt it
yes
$unc$jessica $unc$tandy won best actress
and
yeah
thats right
it might have one best picture too
yes
it did
yes
it did
yeah
just as rain man with $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman that was tremendous and $unc$tom $unc$cruise
that was
yeah
i think it was more a lesson for $unc$tom $unc$cruise than anything else in terms of how to act from $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman
but
yes
that was what much of the hype was that $unc$tom $unc$cruise learned so much from $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman
yeah
it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff
yeah
and a good bit of that was filmed right in $unc$cincinnati which is just $unc$forty-five miles from where i actually live in a suburb of $unc$dayton
oh
is the $unc$kmart there
we do have $unc$kmart here
you better believe it
isnt there a $unc$kmart everywhere
that was so funny
he had to
was it $unc$kmart
yes
he had to buy his underwear at $unc$kmart
right
right
yeah
that was hilarious
the first scene in that movie that really got my attention concerning the disease and all that was when he dropped the toothpicks
yes
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image
yes
yes
unbelievable
there are people referred to as savants also who can do most phenomenal things
yeah
and everyone feels they are totally retarded
yeah
because thats the way they might seem outwardly
thats right
but boy theres a lots going on in there
its amazing
yeah
yeah
and i think the best thing about $unc$rainman was the way that they put together the real awfulness of the disease only
yes
and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it
and you need to work with it certainly on a daily basis but then again work with it toward a good end not toward winning in $unc$las $unc$vegas for example
yes
and the
right
the warmth that developed between them
and again it i think was a picture of relationships
yeah
again the relationship between the $unc$two that never would have occurred by accident
right
right
i was so impressed with that movie
i saw it $unc$three times
did you
i can tell you so much about that movie just because it really rang a lot of my personal background
i have a brother myself thats older
and hes not
nothing of course serious is wrong with him
but we have gone through these lapses of a relationship sometimes
yes
and then for no real direct reason i guess we get into a really good relationship for a while and then back and forth
so i was really able to relate to the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers
that was neat
uh-huh
thats tremendous
its good because it does make you think about your own family
yeah
a lot
and it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother
uh-huh
no question
hes $unc$one of these guys though that doesnt really like to go see movies like that
he likes the bang them up and shoot them up things
uh-huh
and it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it
but boy he gave the best response that ive heard him give of this type of movie for rain man
he certainly didnt
he only saw it $unc$one time
and he didnt go back for more
but he said he enjoyed it
and
he at least saw it $unc$one time
yeah
yeah
and he really
i dont know
hes kind of a $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman fan anyway
but before he saw the movie he was disappointed that $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman would do this
im like come on
just think of what a phenomenal actor $unc$dustin $unc$hoffman is
yeah
he will do that to research it and to be able to mimic a person with the kinds of problems that he had
and to make it believable
yes
i was believing it
i dont know about any body else
but it was great
im sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them
he did great
its just been delightful talking with you
yeah
yeah
you take care up there
and lets hear it for the summertime
absolutely
im ready for it
but theyre predicting some more snow for our direction
no
no
take care
take care now
bye bye
bye bye
where do you get most of your news
i watch the $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer news hour
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends
where are you
im in $unc$dallas
yeah
are you in $unc$dallas also
no
im in $unc$san $unc$antonio
really
okay
i get my news from a combination of sources
i take the paper every day
uh-huh
and i read it on the way in to work in a carpool
really
uh-huh
and actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work
and then usually over lunch therell be a big topic of conversation on something from the news
uh-huh
i normally find that im probably the most news hungry of my friends
so we dont normally talk about the news at lunch
i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week
uh-huh
but i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
yeah
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work
the $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer news hour is on public television
uh-huh
and i enjoy that quite a bit
yeah
$unc$one of the women that i work with her husband is $unc$iranian
uh-huh
so here lately with all the $unc$middle $unc$eastern news weve had some very interesting conversations over lunch
i will admit i work with someone whos $unc$iranian
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news
uh-huh
hes very very skeptical of the news media
and i will admit im reasonably skeptical also
but i dont know hes much more so
its sort of interesting though because he does bring a much different perspective with all the $unc$gulf goings on
he was always speaking in terms of american imperialism reasserting itself
i suppose its a different attitude that we normally dont hear in the country
uh-huh
i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize
uh-huh
true
the
i understand that the $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer probably doesnt
they tend to spend quite a bit of time on $unc$one story
uh-huh
they will have maybe $unc$two or $unc$three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time
sort of like what is that $unc$a $unc$b cs nightline
uh-huh
i guess they only normally stick with just the $unc$one story
but they can do a much better job since they dont have to chop it into little $unc$two minute stories
they dont report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town
no
no
its very much national interest news
yeah
a lot of times they end up with these panels of experts
and they go back and forth where everyones giving some opinions
and sometimes that
i dont know the value of that because i saw plenty of jokes and editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making a living during the $unc$gulf $unc$war
ive been getting a kick out of those lately
uh-huh
although
im only $unc$twenty-five
so ive never actually been through a period of war
uh-huh
and i dont know anyone in the military
and i dont have a lot of background knowledge in military strategy and weaponry and all that kind of stuff
and i thought the generals were very interesting
when they started to speculate i saw that for what is was and thought all of these guys dont know whats going on
uh-huh
but i thought they were interesting
and they shed some light on what was going on for me
i will admit its interesting
im $unc$twenty-six
so i dont have any more experience in that than you
it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind
there were some that were screaming for air power
there were some that were saying the air power wasnt going to do it
uh-huh
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does
but these guys had a national soap box to stand on and express this view
$unc$one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a $unc$saturday morning on $unc$a $unc$b $unc$c
and it was for children
uh-huh
and it was hosted by $unc$peter $unc$jennings
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
and they had all their correspondents in the different areas in $unc$saudi $unc$arabia and $unc$israel and all
they had them all on
i dont know what youd call it other than on line
they had them all on hold
uh-huh
and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person
and that person would answer the question
it was just very informative and interesting
and i was real impressed at how $unc$a $unc$b $unc$c handled translating the war for children
uh-huh
yeah
i didnt see anything like that although i did
i guess $unc$one thing that i found sort of interesting
this is getting a little off the topic
but there was a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children
uh-huh
i thought that was a really unusual thing
and our local $unc$h $unc$e $unc$b stores here
i dont know if its $unc$h $unc$e $unc$b statewide or whatever
but they have videos that
i dont know if they still have them
but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war
uh-huh
ju-
it was
with the childrens aspect
right
it was something for children that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
uh-huh
i suppose that is a valuable service
again not having lived through another war i dont know if thats a common thing that people thought of
or if that was a new concern with people
back during the $unc$viet $unc$nam conflict that no one will have the guts enough to call a real war
uh-huh
that type of technology just wasnt at peoples disposal
thats true
thats true
so i dont think theres ever been a war thats been so thoroughly covered by the news
and probably more importantly $unc$one that lasted short enough that peoples interest didnt flag too badly
yeah
i tell you what
the first $unc$three days i was glued to the television
i will admit the same thing
and i would come home and flip on $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer
and i
and they would run these extended $unc$two $unc$three hour versions of the program
yeah
and i was horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing
i tell you what
the war start-
lets see was it a $unc$wednesday or $unc$thursday
must have been $unc$thursday
and $unc$friday night i stayed up until $unc$two oclock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
uh-huh
because i was watching $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
and they would switch back to $unc$one of their $unc$israel bureaus
and the people would be standing there in gas masks
and youd be hearing the sirens
and it was just
i was amazed
uh-huh
i didnt have that experience
i dont have cable
oh
so im pretty much limited to $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s which i thought they did a very good job
uh-huh
ive got $unc$one question for you
you say you take the newspaper
uh-huh
i found the newspaper situation in $unc$dallas very interesting
weve got the $unc$one relatively weaker paper the $unc$times $unc$herald and then the $unc$morning $unc$news which has a very strong subscription
uh-huh
does $unc$san $unc$antonio ha-
you said $unc$san $unc$antonio right
uh-huh
do you have just $unc$one paper
or do you have several
no
there are $unc$two
and theyre pretty close
the $unc$one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper
i grew up near $unc$houston
uh-huh
and there are $unc$two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck
and the $unc$one i picked here had the same format as the $unc$one that my parents took as i was growing up the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff
uh-huh
its piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over
and i enjoy
the comics are better in this newspaper
this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy
and the other $unc$one has some weird ones that ive never heard of
so
i actually take both newspapers on the weekends
do you
i figure im only taking on the weekend
and i can afford that
yeah
i find the news reporting in the $unc$morning $unc$news to be better
but i sort of have a liberal political slant
and the $unc$morning $unc$news just has an incredibly conservative editorial outlook
and my fiancee takes probably $unc$six $unc$sunday papers
i get the $unc$times $unc$herald just to balance that out a little bit
he takes both $unc$san $unc$antonio papers an austin paper both $unc$houston papers
i guess he takes $unc$seven the $unc$san $unc$marcos paper and the $unc$new $unc$braunsfel paper
but hes a football coach at $unc$southwest $unc$texas $unc$state $unc$university
so hes getting all the sports sections
uh-huh
and he has these stacks of $unc$sunday newspapers that go unread
i guess dont really have a problem with capital punishment
im not really sure what the exact specifications are for $unc$texas
i know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes
and thats probably the way i feel about it is it kind of depends on the crime thats committed
my belief all my life i guess has been that if you take someone elses life then you automatically are giving up yours in place of it
but i dont
seems to be a lot of controversy about that
yeah
i tend to agree with you
probably pretty similar views on it
but thats $unc$one of the things i dont understand is so much of the controversy
because i do also myself believe in capital punishment
it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the $unc$state when they so callously and usually without even thinking or without any concern end somebody elses life and in a lot of cases several peoples lives
thats true
i guess theres probably $unc$two or $unc$three different types of views as far as the controversy goes
i can see where if a life was taken by accident or i dont know what youd call it not premeditated or i guess primarily by accident there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for
but i lean towards if its premeditated or if its kind of or a tendency that people may get into then i guess i dont really have a problem with it
yeah
yeah
thats kind of the way i feel
if youve got a guy whos been to trial and has been in and out of jail basically a $unc$three time loser for the twelfth time and he goes out and kills somebody hes not going to be reformed
hes not going to get any better
its just not going to get any better
and the only thing
a lot of people have the opinion dont have capital punishment
but give them life in jail
and i could go along with that if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after $unc$ten or $unc$twelve years
yeah
yeah
i think thats what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty
and they wind up back on the streets after $unc$five years or $unc$six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in $unc$mesquite who was out in $unc$six months
uh-huh
yeah
its just our criminal system is just so i guess overloaded
but the problem is not so much with the prison system
because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws
and the prison system are just
theyre trying to cope with them
but the thing about capital punishment i
a lot of people dont think it would be a deterrent to future crime
and the way it is now its not
no
because you
if
the $unc$state of $unc$texas for example may execute somebody twice a year
thats no kind of deterrent because weve got literally hundreds of people on death row and many of them who have been there literally for $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen years on death row
right
and thats certainly no kind of deterrent
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that its not a deterrent because its not
no
its not
you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after committing a crime are really pretty slim right now
and you can probably spend a lot of time or maybe eventually just waiting it out
yeah
uh-huh
and thats where a lot of aggravation comes i think is these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process
uh-huh
they may spend years
and the last i heard it was costing $unc$ten $unc$twenty $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars a year to keep these guys waiting
yeah
its amazing
theres a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact
her father was murdered her father and $unc$three other guys up here in $unc$sherman
and the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death hes been on death row for like $unc$eight years
yeah
and this was her father that got killed just cold-blooded murder him and $unc$three other people
but still for some reason this guys sentence has not been carried out
hes sitting on death row for $unc$eight years after having killed $unc$four people
and the $unc$state still cant bring itself to execute this guy
to carry it out
it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system
it does
it really does
she and they have to go back
occasionally she has to write letters to the parole board and lawyers
and just ever so often she mentions shes got to do something else write another letter or do something
yeah
its just
it should be over and done with
yeah
yeah
she should be getting on with her life getting that part behind her
but yet its kind of tied to her the way it is now
yeah
it is
and she winds up being a victim day after day after day
yeah
yeah
right
a victim
not only indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement
right
its ridiculous
shes an emotional victim
yeah
yeah
its terrible
and
and like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window
yeah
that
man i couldnt be a cop for that very reason because they do
the criminal gets right back out
and the cops just got to go back and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are done by repeat offenders
yes
they are
its
thats about $unc$five minutes
so unless youve got something else
yeah
no
its a pleasure talking with you
all right
$unc$ron well see you later
okeydoke
good-bye
bye-bye
okay
tell me about your home
its an older home
it was made back in the early sixties
its a pier beam house
huh-uh
got $unc$three bedrooms $unc$one bath and that just makes me scream
thats pretty tough
what area do you live in
i live in $unc$houston
okay
i see
is that pretty typical for your area
for the neighborhood im in
yeah
yeah
this is $unc$one of the more established neighborhoods
huh-uh
that sounds real interesting
i live in a suburb of $unc$dallas
and i live in the basic $unc$three bedroom $unc$two bath home
so at least i have $unc$two bathrooms
thats not so bad
but its pretty typical for the area as well
ive always been interested in older homes personally
i think you can end up doing more with them it seems like
what about yard space
do you have a big lot or anything like that
the whole lot im sitting on is roughly half an acre
i see
about half of that about a quarter acre of that ive got a garden
huh-uh
thats nice
because i have just those basic tract houses like that
we have a very small yard
and i do have garden
but its extremely small
but it seems like though for your area that is sort of different
in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like what we live in just a basic tract house
in the newer neighborhoods and development communities the houses are so close together
yeah
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow
thats exactly right
thats the way we are
$unc$one thing we have that we really enjoy here is we have a hot tub in the back
so we have quite a few parties
and seems like everyone that lives around us ends up hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone
so thats true
that is $unc$one thing that i dont enjoy about it is the houses are too close together
but its fine for now
hopefully eventually well move in a larger home
the only thing that i dont like also is the rooms are so small
its very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that
so
are your rooms in your house bigger since its a sixties home
because it seems like then that they built the homes much larger
is that true
yeah
and theyve got better closet space
yeah
new houses that ive seen
yeah
yeah
thats really it
thats a plus
at least we do have $unc$three walk-in closets here
so thats maybe not so typical
but
it helps a bunch
yeah
it really does except when you have to fill them up
and then you get those $unc$visa bills in
and
yeah
anything else about
can you compare yourself to any thing around there
most of the neighborhood im in is pretty typical
this whole neighborhood was built between $unc$sixty and $unc$sixty-five
yeah
so its
everybody has got a pretty good size yard
yeah
i got probably the biggest
if not the biggest yard ive got pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood
yeah
thats nice
that is nice
but too the only bad thing too is that then you have to keep up
you have to the yard to deal with
i enjoy that though
and
do you
you must have more time than i have
im sitting out here right now
we had this terrible rain
and im looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
and it seems like
now thats
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something
its rained
yeah
i dont know do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time
do you know
no
we can
after you go to somewhere between $unc$five and $unc$ten minutes theyll get a little master recording on this
okay
okay
can you tell me anything else about the house
are you working on it
do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation
yeah
this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice
yeah
thats nice
yeah
the town that i came from is a older town
it like
the typical homes there are early $unc$nineteen hundreds late $unc$eighteen hundreds
wow
and i renovated a house there
and that was so much fun
there if you dont live in a house thats at least $unc$seventy-five to $unc$hundred years old youre just nobody practically
and that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline
and was considered typical for that area
so it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now thats just a very square little box
and theres not a whole lot you can do with it
but
living in the city has some advantages
yeah
thats true
if given the choice im getting out
really
i have lived in a small town for
this town was less than $unc$ten $unc$thousand people
and it was about $unc$sixty miles south of $unc$dallas
and i didnt move out of there until i was $unc$twenty-seven
and that was just
so i love the big city
i had lived in a rural area for so long
so ive enjoyed it
but it can get kind of tough
its like a rat race sometimes
thats just something ill never adapt to
i dont want to be a part of the rat race
i want to be basically just kind of left alone
yeah
if i want to sit around and mess with my garden ill mess with my garden
yeah
if i want to work in the flower beds
yeah
it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well
i
very much
yeah
i really do enjoy that
but i havent planted anything yet
or i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo
but i havent done that yet
ive had finals this week
so im just kind of trying to stick in with that
huh-uh
but since thats over with now maybe i can get this yard in shape
do you do a lot of gardening
landscaping is more than the gardening
yeah
in the garden ive got my beans peas
yeah
ive got some onions out tomatoes
yeah
im not real sure what theyre going to do this year
i never have much luck with tomatoes
i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the bugs get on them so easily
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that
so the only thing that i use is soap
i spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
but i dont have luck with that tomato plant
so i hate to spray them with anything
what do you do
do you have any tips you could give me
my favorite $unc$one dust
yeah
yeah
and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time
thats true
thats true
my dad is a farmer
ive heard him talk about that forever
i guess it works
but you have to really wash your vegetables after that
so it wont make you sick
lets see what else do you do to your house
ive done some rewiring on it
yeah
eventually if we stay here im going to have to rewire the entire house
really
do you plan on adding any rooms or
you have enough space
you could probably do that
or is it
ive talked about adding at least $unc$one more room and definitely adding another bath on
yeah
i would think so if you only have $unc$one bathroom for $unc$three bedrooms
thats tough
do you not have a half bath
not even a half bath
yeah
yeah
thats rough
the house that i used to live in had $unc$one bath and a half
and that was even just with $unc$two people
that was a pain
the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works were getting ready to go to work at totally different times so that its not like were tripping over each other in the morning
thats good
really
that could account for a lot of marital problems i think
you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
it doesnt work if youre trying to shave and shes trying to put her eyeliner on
and youre both fighting over the mirror
no
thats right
it does not make for a happy situation
thats true
do you have any children
ive got $unc$one
$unc$one child
and they enjoy where theyre living
well
hes $unc$nine months old
so he doesnt know
i guess hes a big help out in your garden
right
he likes to dig around a little bit
his mother comes in and says why did you let him play in the dirt
i guess hes enjoying himself
thats right
its healthy
why not
yeah
he was eating the dirt
i wouldnt worry about it
no
it wont hurt them
i was a big dirt eater supposedly when i was a child
and i turned out okay
so dont worry about it
just let him enjoy himself
you think that you want to move away from the big city
thats what ive always
i was raised up in a town that was about $unc$ten $unc$thousand people
yeah
so youre just the opposite from me
you want to go back to that
after we got married we ended up moving to the $unc$houston area
yeah
yeah
are you from $unc$texas
yeah
you are
so its not
thats true
$unc$houston in itself is a pretty tough place
okay
im back on
okay
you say you watch evenings mostly
i watch evenings because i work all day
i used to watch daytimes
uh-huh
mainly like all my children that kind of thing
so
and then sometimes $unc$oprah and sometimes $unc$donahue
but now its mainly evenings
do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when youre not going to be there
yes
which ones
i tape $unc$thirty something and $unc$l $unc$a law
oh
those are the $unc$two i like the best
$unc$two theyre going to change
$unc$one theyre taking off
i know
its going to be history i know
i dont know whats going to ha-
yeah
we like $unc$l $unc$a law
uh-huh
we dont watch $unc$thirty something
but thats kind of young for us
my husband and i are grandparents
so we dont watch that type of show
but we like $unc$l $unc$a law
we like that
uh-huh
were just
im sorry theyre breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
i know
im amazed
im not sure i like the new ones too much
huh-uh
i was surprised at the ending with all the funny things happening and different things
i just wonder if they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since its gone on for so long
it looks like it might be $unc$one of these $unc$seven or $unc$eight year run things where you kind of can spend your whole career on $unc$one show
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know
of course i guess thats not bad
$unc$alan $unc$alda did it on mash
i know
isnt that funny
it hasnt hurt him at all
do you mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
i dont usually like stuff that continues
thats why im surprised i like those $unc$two shows because usually i like stuff that just ends sort of that you dont have to have watched
in $unc$one hour like quantum leap
yeah
you dont have to
thats $unc$one of our favorites
yeah
you dont have to have watched it last week in order to follow
so i usually dont like that
right
which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
uh-huh
thats always a bummer too
i know
sometimes its better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in $unc$one
uh-huh
we do that sometimes
i guess im not into real heavy stuff
$unc$l $unc$a law is about the heaviest thing i watch
mostly im into it for relaxation
yeah
so i like things like golden girls or $unc$cheers
or $unc$monday night is real good with me $unc$major dad and northern exposure and
whats that $unc$one with $unc$burt $unc$reynolds
that type of show is what we watch
uh-huh
we generally just stay on $unc$one channel for all of $unc$monday night just to watch those
just some of the times theyre continued
but mostly theyre just little vignettes
a new $unc$one we found we really like is that dinosaurs
have you seen that
huh-uh
its really funny
they use animated
its not a cartoon
but its dummies and things that are used
uh-huh
and its really
and robots probably
but theres always a moral to each story
and what night is it on
we watched it
the times weve seen it its been on $unc$friday night
but its
weve only seen it a couple of times
but its real
the first $unc$one we saw it involved a tradition of when a person reaches $unc$seventy-five
and i cant remember what day they call it
but the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when theyre $unc$seventy $unc$five over a cliff
great
it goes on
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
oh
and she said no
you cant do
he was running in a wheelchair to hide her
and she said you cant do that
this is tradition
this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff
and he said i dont understand
its real funny that they give the teenagers as the $unc$one that questions whats going on
uh-huh
and in the end the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you cant do it and then oh well weve got to do it its tradition
and the son was why
and so in the end he doesnt throw her over
uh-huh
he doesnt
and of course the town thinks hes just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and hes broken it
and then we saw $unc$one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood
they call it the night of the howling or something like that
uh-huh
and they all go out and howl
and the son refused to do it
he did
he thought it was not
he didnt go howl
no
he wouldnt go howl
so all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
how funny
it is
its real interesting to watch the show
and the relationship between the family is really now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them
so its
our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it
but it moves real fast
its real short
and theres always like i say a moral to it
and
its just a half hour
or is it hour
half hour
oh
thats all there is to it
and they
theres not many half hour shows
it seems like that
yeah
theyre trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to $unc$jackie $unc$gleason show the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth
uh-huh
and i guess maybe there are some parts of that
but i didnt really see that in there
but what ive read about it they talk about that
but anyway weve enjoyed that
and i guess mostly i like the news shows too the news magazines like $unc$sixty minutes or $unc$twenty $unc$twenty or prime time live or something like that all of those shows if i can do it
yeah
no
i watch those if i
but my husband likes to watch old movies especially war movies or sports which im not
i like sports
no
i dont
i like ice skating
and i like gymnastics and some track and field
uh-huh
but i
and ill watch snippets of baseball games
and i just dont have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
uh-huh
and no matter whats on i dont ever just sit and watch t v
im usually either doing dishes
or i may be sewing
or i always have letter writing
i know
or i may be working around in the room somehow
but i dont ever just sit and
thats something that comes from your old age
no
i dont sit
idle hands are the devils workshop
i know
who has time
i dont have time to sit i know
no
its
thats why i dont get to watch that much
i watch $unc$nine oclock
right
i do okay because the kids are all in bed
but before that theres not much time
right
or at $unc$six $unc$thirty ill watch wheel of fortune or something like that
right
our
yeah
if our grandchildren are with us they have to watch that
we dont watch it unless theyre here
uh-huh
no
i like that
no
ill watch game show kind of stuff
but they
but yeah
its
and the kids will get you started on stuff like americas funniest home videos
weve wound up sending in $unc$one
thats something i didnt think that wed ever do
did you send $unc$one
yeah
my oldest grandson pulling his tooth
he wouldnt let us pull it
how funny
and it got to the point he was eating a pear here
and he bit into it
and it was just hanging by a thread
and id tell him its getting ready to fall out
and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldnt let anybody pull it
and he wound up pull
do you have p $unc$c
i have a personal computer at home
its an a t compatible
i dont use it very much any more
i used to use it quite a bit
uh-huh
i also have a p c at work that i use as a terminal
i do some p c stand alone work on it
and i can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame
uh-huh
what about you
do you own a computer
i sort of own a computer
we have $unc$two p $unc$c at home
but neither one do we really own
are you leasing them
no
both of them are sort of work related
and
loaners from work
yeah
thats the nicer way right
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
no
actually im doing consulting right now because i just had a baby
and my husbands working at $unc$bell $unc$labs
but hes really from $unc$france
and these computers actually are from $unc$france
what brand are they
$unc$one of thems a $unc$compaq
uh-huh
its a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six
im jealous
and the other is actually a i $unc$b $unc$m p c compatible
its a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six
i guess its $unc$twenty-five
yeah
$unc$three $unc$eight $unc$six $unc$twenty-five c maybe
i dont know
no we dont have the
we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner $unc$one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
and
what kind of consulting do you do
i actually do some work working at $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t and at $unc$nist $unc$national $unc$institute of $unc$standards and $unc$technology in $unc$washington
uh-huh
and then i worked for $unc$dragon $unc$systems for a while
what kind of work do you do when youre consulting
it depends
its very different in the different places
but
is it programming related
yeah
yeah
program related research related
and i work in the speech field
and i do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech
uh-huh
and i do that type of stuff typically for other people
and here we use the p $unc$c to do that
mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
word processing
more
do you know $unc$latek word text processing
no im not familiar with that
i dont use
you can call it word processing
but i dont usually use a word processor to do it
uh-huh
and we dont have too much standard software
we havent really bought any commercially available software at all
we dont use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also just as a terminal
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
youve got a modem in it then
neither one has a modem
but we have a modem
at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them
neither one
right
and so its an external modem
yeah
we have
when i got mine i had an internal modem in it
uh-huh
i used it quite a bit when i was looking at information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in $unc$fort $unc$worth
uh-huh
but went out of town for a while
and sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely
uh-huh
and after a while the modem started making noises on its own even without using it on the computer
i could turn a computer on
itd start squawking
so i finally opened up the box and took it out
that was it
i think thats the $unc$thirty second warning
i didnt hear it
do you hear the beep in the background
yes
thats an ambulance or something going on here i think
okay
where are you
i havent ever noticed the $unc$thirty second warning actually
and
in $unc$manhattan
are you at home now
yeah
im at home
youve got a lot of traffic noise real close
uh-huh
itd be interesting for the people that look at this signal because theres a lot of background noise that people can hear
so itll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up
yeah
and often times that
i cant do this much later than now between sort of $unc$five $unc$thirty and $unc$six $unc$thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i cant even hear the phone call
what time is it now where you are
about $unc$twenty after $unc$four
so youre an hour ahead of where i am
im in central time zone
okay
yeah
were eastern
and did you ever try using like $unc$prodigy or any of those systems
no
i havent done that
i know someone who has
and shes very pleased with it
she told me some of the things you can do
and its just a very handy tool to have
uh-huh
yeah
and you can do a l-
it makes things very convenient
you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if thats what you have in mind
uh-huh
yeah
ive never tried using that
i dont know too much about it
what about
did you use commercially available software
or
i have used $unc$lotus
i have used $unc$word $unc$perfect
uh-huh
i
not heavy use
ive used $unc$d $unc$base
and ive used a substantial amount of shareware
i havent done much $unc$lotus work connected with my job
ive been through $unc$three classes
uh-huh
and i have a great deal of respect for it
uh-huh
i havent done much word processing work with my job
i do some
uh-huh
and i
and the $unc$d $unc$base work ive done was strictly class related
ive never used $unc$d $unc$base
but ive heard both good things and bad things about it
its probably the granddaddy of most data base management systems
uh-huh
its got some pretty strong competitors
some of them have reviews that are better than $unc$d $unc$base
so i think by now its a matter of personal taste
yeah
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
i can understand that very easily
ive had a class on $unc$r $unc$base and also in $unc$paradox
uh-huh
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to $unc$d $unc$base
uh-huh
do you think $unc$d $unc$base is more flexible or allows you to do more
or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
i wouldnt say compatible but certainly comparable
but
yeah
i didnt mean compatible
i meant comparable
my brain is going to mush
uh-huh
and what do you work on at $unc$t $unc$i
im a computer programmer on the i $unc$b $unc$m main frames
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do mainly business data processing
uh-huh
i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
uh-huh
sometimes i get called late at night at home because theres a production problem
and that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if i cant think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while were on the phone
right
i also handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
okay
i guess first of all i could have asked that before
do you have children
no
no
okay
because i didnt know if that would make a difference in how you felt
yeah
what do you think about the proposal that all young $unc$americans should spend a year or $unc$two
i think its a good idea
i think everybody should put in their time so to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves
yeah
i think its
would everyone grow up and mature and realize what this countrys all about
i just
i guess thats something that my family has always believed strongly in
and i had opportunities in high school to work in some programs
did you
oh!
and i agree with what you said that it benefits the person doing it so much i dont think they realize
uh-huh
and i think it gives you a better perspective on life
and it gives you a little bit more a glimpse of the real world
and it would certainly help the country too
yeah
really
yeah
i think thats probably quite a few things that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through
yeah
they did things for people for their communities for their families for their friends where now im not sure they really do
yes
yeah
i think sometimes through groups and organizations
when they asked the question i thought that sounds wonderful
and then i wondered if people were unwilling
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i dont think it would stay negative very long
but i do know through some organized groups like $unc$scouts and church they do still have opportunities
uh-huh
yeah
thats probably true
but i think thats a small number could
but even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to
no
not as much as i remember growing up
and that was something i think in the fifties and sixties seemed more common in the last $unc$two decades
uh-huh
yeah
i think thats probably true
but
i think its probably more true still in the smaller communities then in the larger cities
yeah
yeah
where abouts do you live
what part of the country
i live in $unc$richardson right now which is just
okay
were in $unc$plano
so were not far apart
right
yeah
okay
$unc$one of the calls id gotten before was down to $unc$austin
and i know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest
so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
yeah
gosh
i hadnt even thought about it being out of the area
but youre right
yeah
i grew up in a real small town in $unc$florida
oh
i mean a real small town
and i think it was just
of course it was back in the fifties
and i think it was real prevalent back then
i think people thought more of others than they do now as far as doing things for them and then gaining benefits from it
yeah
and maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back if weve lost some of that
and it seems in the last decade or $unc$two thats true
maybe thats a way
if young people had to do it maybe that would start the trend back because thats $unc$one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country is helping others
uh-huh
yeah
i do to
i do to
im not sure that todays kids would go for it though
i think you would have to start younger
yeah
i dont know how young youd have to go
but i think by the time theyre early teenagers anyway i think its too late now at least around here
yeah
i think it does help even preschoolers
theyre things even just starting around the home
right
little ones can do a little bit to help the family
uh-huh
and just watching the parents do things too it can start a pattern
theres always something no matter how young
and then that helps develop that attitude
i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more
i think this is certainly a possible way to handle it
but i wish
thats something that i think that has been lost in families
and i think thats a good place to start again
yeah
i think it has to start in the families first because if you dont do it for your own immediate family youre sure not going to do it for anybody else
yeah
and i do think the schools
if youre trying to do something even with food drives
and sometimes what $unc$richardson and $unc$plano both
when you live in areas like that where theres so much they dont realize what a small percentage of the world that is
uh-huh
thats
gosh im sure not even $unc$one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas
and its
thats probably true
thats probably true
i know our church youth group starts with projects young
but they have a high school group that works in the $unc$appalachia area every year
uh-huh
theyve done this for $unc$fourteen years now
thats great
and its
and theyve also see that theres a different way of life and those families are really close
some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there
uh-huh
and it really
every youth thats ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and its changed their perspective
and thats just the $unc$two weeks during the summer
uh-huh
so if $unc$two weeks could have that kind of effect i would think
thats great
im glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing
thats
like i said i think it does
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes
yes
i guess
did you have anything else
no
no
i guess thats about all
okay
okay
i enjoyed talking with you
good talking with you
and i hope you have a good evening
you too
thanks
okay
bye
bye
bye
okay
have you ever had to put your children in child care $unc$mary $unc$dell
yes
im an old experienced hand
i started back when it wasnt stylish to do that at all
my daughter thats $unc$seventeen now i worked even when she was a baby
uh-huh
oh
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were $unc$two
and then i was really lucky to have put them in a methodist day school at $unc$preston $unc$hollow $unc$methodist right off of $unc$walnut $unc$hill and $unc$preston
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it was a wonderful environment
i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
uh-huh
i see
so it worked well
oh
how about you
i have a $unc$nine year old and a $unc$six year old
and neither one of them has ever been in day care for the reason of me working
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they both went through preschool
yeah
and weve just been real lucky i think anyway to not
uh-huh
its not hard to find anything thats part-time
so many of the churches have really strong preschool and childrens day out
right
half day programs
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it was a nightmare back when $unc$cheryl was little
and this is $unc$one of the few churches that did it
there were a couple downtown $unc$dallas
but they seemed cold and impersonal
i just couldnt hack it
uh-huh
and what i liked about $unc$preston $unc$hollow is that the people that were there when $unc$cheryl was $unc$two which was $unc$fifteen years ago many of them are still there today
so there was real continuity
oh
she went back as a teenager
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was $unc$three were still there
my gosh
so it was really neat
but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts
uh-huh
my goodness
and im really glad my kids had it because $unc$plano schools do so little of that that if they hadnt had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
right
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that is a big drawback i think in the public schools out here to
uh-huh
youre lucky to have an art teacher
and if you do you get them once a week or something
or pay for it after school
our emilys in the third grade over at $unc$huffman
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take $unc$french and music and art
and i willingly did it
is that right
i had no idea
but i thought this makes me angry
this is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do
my goodness
and with our budget cuts im sure thats not going to change anytime soon
yeah
thats the only way theyre going to be able to do it
and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that
my goodness
so in some ways i think the day schools do serve those purposes
yeah
thats true
even the preschools they get so much of that in preschool
and then when they hit kindergarten its like wham culture shock
yeah
yeah
its just
put the colors away
yeah
yeah
get the computers out
which is too bad
and
uh-huh
thats hard
uh-huh
its so difficult for them
did you have your children did you say in private care
was that in your home or in someone elses home
until they were $unc$two
yeah
yeah
both times they were at our house
uh-huh
so you were able to have somebody come there
and that was hard too
i lucked out with really good people both times
but i know so many people that are never able to find that
and id practically give my paycheck away to do it
yeah
yeah
did you have a nanny
or did you have someone that lived in with you
yeah
no
she didnt live with us
the first $unc$one was an elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money
oh
my goodness
and she kept $unc$cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night
uh-huh
and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead
yeah
oh
so that was a plus from that respect as well
gosh
and then with $unc$emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her
uh-huh
uh-huh
i have
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center
uh-huh
i was just listening to a program this morning
i guess it was on the home show
but they were talking about a new
i cant even think of the name of it
i was halfway listening while i was painting
uh-huh
its some kind of advisory board theyve put together for parents and children
uh-huh
and theyve now moved it to $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
and the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said i cant imagine leaving a $unc$three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there
yeah
that would be hard
they give a lot more leave
i work at $unc$n $unc$c $unc$n $unc$b now
and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people are really expanding
uh-huh
we have more options now then we did when my kids were born
with being able to take off full-time longer you can phase your schedule in so that its not full-time for up to $unc$six months
uh-huh
boy thats great
its really neat
ive had a couple of assistants that came back just $unc$three days a week
or theyve whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
uh-huh
uh-huh
we try to work it with their hours
and that helps because you dont have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for $unc$eight hours a day again
yeah
right
right
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals
ive
of course its too late for me so ive not tried them to see how effective they are
yeah
but i think were finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
uh-huh
uh-huh
god its amazing
and for our age group its too late too little too late
right
right
but i do think its an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work
uh-huh
uh-huh
$unc$two income families i think are here to stay
and i would think since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do the people that work in big business have families
uh-huh
right
they have children
yeah
so its only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working
oh sure
and
you retain employees and keep them longer
that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our $unc$employee $unc$assistance $unc$programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in $unc$fifteen $unc$million pieces
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
right
so i hope it helps
it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time
good
because thats hard
thats good to know
i have a couple of friends that have found a private home to take their children to when theyre young until they hit the preschool age
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they
usually youll find a woman thats keeping $unc$six children or $unc$four to $unc$six children in the home
uh-huh
and my future sister-in-laws mother does that too full-time
in $unc$plano though the problem is you find
and this is what i found with $unc$emily
from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in $unc$plano area
uh-huh
and i kept finding neighbors and friends
and theyd move
oh
she ended up being in a different home every year
too transit
uh-huh
and i finally decided i didnt like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move
and her surroundings
so this year i tried $unc$kinder-care
and then shes old enough to
okay
lets see
we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and plastics
and we make the dump over to the $unc$wal-mart bins there as soon as theyre full
i guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable
are you in the part of town where they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling
no
no
i didnt think that anybody had those at all yet
maybe they dont
i know that was supposed to be in $unc$may
and i couldnt tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were
right
no
i havent seen any
so i thought that it had all been delayed several times
so i have no idea what they look like
and im kind of anxious to see them
yeah
thats going to be interesting because weve gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is
i look at our big green containers
and i say they work fine
and i keep mine outside the garage so that i dont have any odors
but its clearly a place where
right
it will be interesting to see how well that works
and im glad the community is doing it
its $unc$one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
i dont know what you saw back years ago
but for me the thing that strikes me growing up in rural $unc$south $unc$dakota where the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that in the fifties you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now which was all the milk bottles were glass
right
right
and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them
pop bottles all had a deposit on them
oh
of course
that they did
we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
oh
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
uh-huh
you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
yeah
and so you just put the empty ones back out there
and he took them away and put another gallon of glass bottle in there
yeah
yeah
i look back at my childhood
and id say they were doing things then that we should be doing now
and so it doesnt bother me at all that were kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
right
right
it would be nice to see it take a good turn here
it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away
so i hope that this time it stays
just to see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing
yeah
when we go dump our things we collect newspapers too and then take them
seems like theres a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
uh-huh
so thats kind of encouraging
i didnt know if we started to do that
i didnt know what to expect
yeah
ill have to say the only one im good at at this point is the newspaper taking that to the $unc$boy $unc$scouts and my aluminum cans getting rid of those
right
but on the plastic i dont have any habits there yet
and guess im waiting for the city to push me in that direction
but it just seems like on the larger scale that we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things
i guess they will shortly
i
and i think if we just start to put the nickel deposit on things like was the case years ago that it would have more immediate effect because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money
right
and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
and so outside my little town we would go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
yeah
right
do you know in $unc$tom $unc$thumb yesterday i saw the return to the small $unc$coke bottles
yeah
and i dont know if theres a deposit on those or not
i
thats interesting because
theyre back to glass youre saying
they were the glass
lets see
theyd be i dont know maybe $unc$six ounce or $unc$ten ounce sort of a small size and we didnt stop and look at them a long time
uh-huh
yeah
and they were packed in the old sort of $unc$six pack stick them down sort of a basket type thing
uh-huh
the paper carton
right
right
i hadnt seen that in a long time
yeah
i mean the
you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing
and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold $unc$twenty-four bottles
and im not really say going back to good old days
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now
yeah
yeah
it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because on the grass i know your husband doesnt really like the paper sacks
no
he doesnt like the paper sacks
but he likes to pick the grass up too
he doesnt
yeah
im the same way because otherwise
i generally listen to $unc$neal $unc$sperry on $unc$saturdays and neals a person who says i like to pick it up
but i dont believe in throwing it into the landfill
so i have my compost pile
but most of us dont have the sufficient lot size to do that
right
right
so im glad the citys willing to take that on
thats nice
i guess they dump it the same place
i wonder where they dump that
theres someplace
if its
because really when i look at what my grass does in actually about $unc$twenty-four hours knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally composts or stores
and so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it
and it will naturally decompose
so you just have to kind of keep in separated
and then who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into
but its certainly usable material
yeah
yeah
they must keep it separate if they have this date in
uh-huh
they have this day now that its separate from the other trash pick up
right
but the thing i dont understand about that is when
its $unc$one thing to send grass there
but ive trimmed trees and other things which end up being something that clearly wont decompose nearly as rapidly
no
okay
what kind of music do you like
i was thinking about it for a long time
and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music
i dont have a whole lot of dislikes
i like jazz especially the blues
and i like a lot of of course the classics everything back from $unc$bach and $unc$beethoven and $unc$chopin and just in general everything
uh-huh
i enjoy a lot of the modern forms
do you like rock and those kind of things punk even
right
right
that gets
some of the punk when i was in high school that was $unc$one of the big things was punk music
and some of it has a lot to say the lyrics do
but the actual
i dont think they have a whole lot to say even
it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music
yeah
i guess
but as far as a musical art form i just dont see a whole lot of art to it
uh-huh
do you like rap
some of it
it depends
the $unc$two types of rap i enjoy to listen to and $unc$one is the rap that is just funny
and they usually do a lot of satire
yeah
that kind i kind of like
right
some of it is kind of pointless
right
the monotonous
yeah
no
thats not
i dont enjoy that at all when theyre just talking about im better than you and blah blah blah
uh-huh
i dont like that
yeah
yeah
i like the funny satire
and then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society
yeah
it really does
it talks about race relations and police relations
and that
i guess i dont really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times
uh-huh
im with you though
i like classical
uh-huh
i dont like to listen to it all the time but some of the time anyway
i like easy listening just kind of
i guess i dont care much for rock and roll any more
i used to like it all right
but i dont really care to listen to it any more for some reason
lets see
country western im not quite as big on that
some of its okay
yeah
thats about my opinion of that
yeah
its okay
some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess
the thing about country western that i dont enjoy is doesnt seem to be any imagination behind it
yeah
$unc$one country and western song sounds like every other country and western
a lot of them sound really similar
yeah
and so the musicians dont get to really get into their music
they just play a certain number of chords
yeah
the drummer plays a certain beat
and you have a country and western song
and
thats kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess
they dont really
has kind of the same sound over and over
and the other thing i dont like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you cant understand what the lyrics are
right
you cant understand what theyre saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them too
yeah
and i cant say that i like a lot of the very modern rock and roll
yeah
but i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll
yeah
earlier things
and i really enjoy especially the sixties
hello
hi
hi
my name is $unc$leslie
hi
im $unc$jennifer
and where are you from
$unc$pennsylvania
nice
im from $unc$dallas $unc$texas
really
yeah
thats neat
did you understand what it was for what we
television shows
yeah
sure
that sounds good
okay
i dont watch too many
but we can try it
okay
are you ready to start
sure am
okay
just a minute
okay
i guess were recording now
yeah
okay
what are your favorite television shows
i dont really watch too many t v shows other than occasionally ill turn on $unc$donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here
really
so if theres no one else around its just me and i have a chance to listen to something ill turn that on but just for the conversation factor i think
and then i think i enjoy when i catch it i dont even know what night its on but designing women sometimes
i love that show
yeah
do you
yes
that is great
yeah
its fun
and then theres a new $unc$one that started out that ive caught a couple of times called good and evil i think
i heard they just canceled that
really
i read in todays paper they just canceled that show
it is a real different one
its different
i guess i watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that i have to see it
but
have you seen the show its new this year called home front
no
i havent watched that
its really good
i think its on $unc$tuesday nights from $unc$ten to $unc$eleven
uh-huh
and its set in post $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two times
and its about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyones going through
its really interesting
yeah
its kind of like a nighttime soap opera type thing
sounds neat
its really well written
yeah
is that on what station
i dont even know to tell you the truth
okay
what other shows do you like
i prefer $unc$oprah $unc$winfrey to $unc$donahue
yeah
she comes on later
and i usually have kids around so i dont end up watching that $unc$one is the only problem i have with it i guess
oh
i did watch soap operas
but i work full-time now and cant catch those anymore except when im home sick
yeah
and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
thats right
theyre stupid
yeah
so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day
uh-huh
but not anymore
that can happen
so do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy
tonight im looking forward to seeing golden girls
thats always fun
yes
i like that show
yeah
and if i can stay up late enough i like to catch $unc$saturday night live every now and then
uh-huh
and right now were watching a $unc$penn $unc$state football game because thats where we live
yeah
uh-huh
its exciting
were winning
so thats really exciting
yeah
i think
i also course like to catch the news during the evening hours
uh-huh
but its a little tough because thats when im usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time
so usually i dont get a whole lot of news watching in
yes
we watch $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n in morning while were getting ready for the day and eating breakfast
uh-huh
well catch our news that way
watch the weather channel so that we know what the weathers going to be like
yeah
yeah
what have you seen interesting on $unc$oprah $unc$winfrey lately
lately i havent been catching it because of my work schedule
uh-huh
i cant remember the last time i saw it
its been a while
yeah
i dont know if weve talked our full $unc$three minutes or not
i dont know
sometimes they come on and say
thats right
today on $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n they were talking about something like this about learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research thats going on which is kind of what were doing helping them get a data base for words
yeah
it was really interesting
it is interesting
do you work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
no
no
just doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
thats nice
yeah
so it kind of makes it easy to do a little something for it
sure
because weve talked to a lot of people from $unc$texas it seems
and we thought maybe they work for $unc$dallas
all right
i think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight
which is movies
correct
that is correct
okay
are you a movie buff
yeah
i dont like going to see them in the theaters
but outside of that rent a lot
watch them on t v mostly
i have a v c r
and i see most all of mine there
what have you seen recently that you enjoyed
i dont know
earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in $unc$l $unc$a
have you seen that movie
no
i havent
its kind of one of those psycho ones
i live alone
consequently i dont like these psycho things
its not too bad
$unc$one of those cop thrillers
but
okay
have you seen the mov-
if
do you have a v c r
yes
we do
have you seen the movie class action with $unc$gene $unc$hackman
no
i havent yet
i saw it this weekend
and it is to me an outstanding movie
i thoroughly enjoyed it
he is an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
and she has a suit against his company
its $unc$one of those things
yeah
that
but theres a lot of l-
its something that anyone can watch and enjoy
hes a good actor though
beg your pardon
$unc$gene hackmans a good actor i think
yes
he is
do you see $unc$hoosiers
yes
ive seen $unc$hoosiers
saw it just again the other night for
yeah
we saw her just the other night too
did you
yeah
its $unc$one of our favorite movies
i live with a roommate and my girlfriend the $unc$three of us
weve seen that movie probably $unc$six times in the last $unc$six months
have you seen the movie crossing $unc$delancy
yeah
thats $unc$one i have watched $unc$six or $unc$eight times
i always feel so good when i get through with that movie
yeah
i like those movies that you watch time and time again
i do too
dirty dancing and crossing $unc$delancy are $unc$two of my favorite
what business are you in
im an electrical engineer
oh
in $unc$new $unc$hampshire
all right
i work in $unc$massachusetts actually
all right
okay
is everything going all right up there
its only about half an hour
i live on the border
thats that bad then
half an hour we do that just going to downtown $unc$dallas
thats right
we live up in tax free $unc$new $unc$hampshire and drive down to $unc$massachusetts to work
that makes a lot of sense
but we
are you a native of that part of the country
yeah
i grew up in $unc$new $unc$hampshire
it seems southern town
its called $unc$portsmouth
its i dont know $unc$fifteen minutes from the $unc$mass- border and $unc$five minutes from the main border
we live right in the corner
oh
that $unc$one little spot in $unc$new $unc$hampshire we have $unc$ten miles of coastline
i live on that little $unc$ten mile spot
sounds wonderful
did you have damage this year with hurricanes
not up where i live
but further down the coast in $unc$massachusetts they got hit pretty bad
i happened to be in $unc$nassau
and we got the backlash of that thing
and they had record high waves $unc$thirty year high waves come in there
and it was quite an experience
what movies are you looking forward to seeing now
im only $unc$twenty-seven years old
so the $unc$doors movie thats out on video i want to watch that
okay
have you seen green card
that would be pretty good
no
i havent seen that $unc$one
thats a real warm movie
it really just turned out nicely
so i would recommend that if you have a chance
im in for it
we rent a lot of movies
so we often sit around and say what movies should we rent
and we dont know
if you can get green card go for it
all right
well try that $unc$one
i have been working as an accountant at the medical school here in $unc$dallas
and i have watched gross anatomy
have you seen that $unc$one
yeah
i did
okay
and i dont know
i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school
but i hope you have a very $unc$merry $unc$christmas
you too
im looking forward to it
i think were going to have a white $unc$christmas up here just like the song says
to begin
i guess space is real important i think
so its real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess
yeah
i agree
its definitely new frontier stuff
but im not too up-to-date on the space frontier
but i guess theyre going pretty far into it now
$unc$star $unc$wars is not too far i dont think
but
i worked on some of it at $unc$t $unc$i once upon a time
have you
yeah
what do you know about it
actually im quite versed lately
i get on a computer network all the time
and people are talking about the current space program all the time
theyre talking about new rockets that theyre designing now that are just like science fiction
its like they take off
and then they land with the
the afterburners are going not like space shuttle landing gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
really
my gosh
yeah
its called $unc$v $unc$c $unc$x or something like that
also called $unc$delta $unc$clipper which is a decent name for something like that
wow
i dont know
you think youd go up in space if you had a chance
yeah
do you
i think i would
i think thatd be neat
i think i would just sitting here talking about it
but if the time came itd be real nervous
id be scared
scared me worse than $unc$six $unc$flags roller coaster
thatd be pretty hairy
i had a tire come off of a car
so i know what its like to
yeah
imagine
depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
right
right
i guess theyre talking about people going to the moon and stuff now wherever and opening up those stations whatever filling them
yeah
theyre talking about doing that again too
uh-huh
i dont know if well ever see that up there
at least were going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years
really
yeah
and theyre going to put
thats all beyond my imagination really
yeah
but science fiction books
you look at the $unc$jetsons cartoon show and its not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons
so you never know
yeah
yeah
any of that stuff from the $unc$jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would become possible and now we have a lot of those
uh-huh
so you never know what may occur
but as far as me seeing it i dont know
yeah
i dont know
but i think its real vital important for the future generations to come
uh-huh
yeah
i
its something definitely that
its got the extra little oomph of interest
yeah
im sure itll draw a lot more interest too once its more possible
but when they start showing the drawings and all that im sure when they
yeah
yeah
i wish
$unc$boeing or $unc$mcdonald $unc$douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it purely commercial
right
uh-huh
and theyd go up and do things
and
did they scratch that $unc$star $unc$wars deal they $unc$one we was all worried about $unc$russia and all that
oh
no
its still probably going
but i dont know whether research will go on
yeah
but the economy the way it is all over they probably cut back on that because its not
yeah
theyre going to be cutting back so much on just the number of troops weve got in $unc$europe and the number of troops we have here
right
yeah
i know
and then
but russias still going to have missiles
theyre still going to be subs and things
yeah
and we dont know whos handling them now
yeah
so thats a whole different story now
latest i heard it was just going to be $unc$russia itself that was going to have them
really
at least thats what everybody says
yeah
yeah
we want only $unc$russia to have them
uh-huh
and now theyre saying yeah
yeah
youre a republic
you dont want those
you dont want those
some crazy hit man over there with those little republics or whatever
they splitting it all up now
and $unc$one of them crazy guys get a hold of it
uh-huh
you never know
but the guy thats taken over for $unc$gorbachev hes supposed to be on our side isnt he
pretty much
one hopes
uh-huh
i think we went through him though to get to $unc$gorbachev on a lot of subjects
uh-huh
but that way you cant never tell that
yeah
kiss some butt
but
$unc$michael what do you think about funding for aids research
do you
thats something ive thought a lot about
uh-huh
i work in a hospital
uh-huh
and ive worked in the hospital for $unc$fifteen years
and ive taken care of a few aids patients
uh-huh
when they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more spend less i think right now what theyre spending is adequate for my personal opinion because i think its something thats going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont think its going to be that easy to come up with
yeah
or i think they already would have by now
uh-huh
so i dont know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now
i think theyre doing as much research as they can possibly do
uh-huh
and what about you
i guess im not too aware of how much theyre spending right now you know
im not either
im definitely not aware of how much
yeah
thats something ive never really kept up with at all
uh-huh
yeah
im not sure
i
go ahead
i know ive always thought more about the disease rather than the research
you know what i mean
uh-huh
yeah
and that sort of thing
if we were talking about the money id just have to say what theyre spending is probably enough simply because i dont know that much about it
yeah
yeah
i can see that research is needed
and
yeah
definitely
i think so
i think so
its becoming a major problem
yeah
but i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on preventing it in more
yeah
yeah
thats true
thats true because its such an easily preventable disease
right
and i feel like just saying safe sex is not the answer
its abstinence in certain cases
no
its definitely not
and
thats true
thats true
yeah
and knowing
myself im about to get a divorce
uh-huh
and course im not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything
yeah
but its sort of scary to find yourself single again
uh-huh
and because you never know whats going to happen
you dont know who youre going to come across
yeah
course im not going to want to go and have sex with everybody i see
uh-huh
but its something you got to think about these days
yeah
a single person
uh-huh
and it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry
yeah
yeah
and
i think for a lot of people it has
certainly
yeah
but i know that in some of these larger cities theyre passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing so that the drug addicts wont be getting dirty needles and everything
uh-huh
drug addicts
uh-huh
yeah
and i dont know
i dont think thats a bad idea
uh-huh
i know it sort of doesnt address the problem of drug addiction
yeah
it just sort of keeps that going
yeah
but i dont know
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids so far cannot be
uh-huh
so i dont know
i think thats
im not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself
uh-huh
i dont know
what do you think about that
yeah
boy thats a hard issue
it really is
it really is
it really is
they gave us a hard topic
yeah
i definitely think that its the drug problem that needs to be addressed
but as you say people in the meantime
someone whos not ready to give up drugs
uh-huh
thats true
thats true
if theyre perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then
yeah
i guess if you consider the $unc$two problems drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first i guess as far as something to do about it
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
so i dont know
course theres so many things in the world where if you solve $unc$one problem you may be creating another
yeah
so i guess you just have to take the $unc$two problems and see which is worse which is the most important to solve at the time
yeah
and
uh-huh
i dont know
yeah
but ive never looked into how much money theyre spending
i have no idea
uh-huh
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that
yeah
but i really have never looked into it
i have no idea
yeah
i havent either
ive heard different voices speaking up and saying were not spending enough
yeah
yeah
and mostly thats what ive heard
right
sure
so i dont know
yeah
and yet i know it sounds like big money to me
yeah
but it probably takes a lot
i think it is
i think it is
yeah
it does every
it seems to take more than for any little thing they do
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would
uh-huh
yeah
but
did you have any fear working in the hospital with that
thats $unc$one thing ive never really feared
uh-huh
i
a lot of my family they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions
but i dont fear it at all
uh-huh
uh-huh
i work in the operating room a lot
uh-huh
and of course when w-
hello
hello
how you doing
fine
im $unc$lee with
im over here in $unc$plano $unc$texas
okay
let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off
sure
okay
oh
okay
where are you calling from
or where are you at
$unc$arlington
$unc$arlington $unc$texas
$unc$arlington
yes
theres a lot of stuff going on in $unc$arlington these days
yes
not all good stuff
are you involved in any of that
no
no
no
im not personally
what benefits do
do you work
im going to school right now
you are
i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husbands or what i think
okay
yeah
ive got a lot of
because i work for myself
uh-huh
and so theres a lot that i guess i do miss a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation
i miss insurance and the steady paychecks that come
yes
right
yes
but
yes
ive been in my own business $unc$mary $unc$kay in fact
im selling in out now to go to school full time
and i enjoyed the freedom of having that
is that right
go to work when i wanted to or not
uh-huh
but the benefits werent there
yeah
i own part of a roofing company
do you
in the $unc$dallas $unc$fort $unc$worth area
uh-huh
and unfortunately we were part of a bigger company
uh-huh
and we had all the benefits there
and i do miss that
yeah
but on the other hand i enjoy having the time that i have with my family and being able to work when i want
right
yeah
uh-huh
and
i think today the thing that i would appreciate the most
because my husband gets his medical through his company
but we have to pay for mine
uh-huh
and im the only $unc$one thats being insured
and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has $unc$four children has
is that right
so its kind of
yeah
and i would
i really
and the way medical expenses are i think thats probably $unc$one of the biggest benefits you need to have
its
yeah
it
yeah
ill tell you what
that is the single most benefit that i enjoyed and i do miss
right
because i looked into picking up some medical insurance just for my family and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it
its out of sight
right
its out of sight
and yeah
even at a group rate i couldnt believe how much is our
yeah
even at a group rate
its unbelievable
and the amount that you have to pay for kids
and if you want to add dental to it that eats even more
right
it goes up
right
yeah
i guess the other benefits that i miss i guess is some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company
uh-huh
and course these days you cant count on that because
right
i feel bad for the people that are involved in that $unc$g $unc$m deal there in in $unc$arlington
right
and im sure it will be quite a few people are affected by that
right
its going to hurt the city
although i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank
and i would see the $unc$g $unc$m people come in when they would shut down to retool
uh-huh
they were paid that whole time
and i dont know if youre aware of this r-
really
yes
they come in there
they go off fishing and stuff and come in every $unc$friday and go to the safety deposit box
and im sitting there making a $unc$hundred dollars a week
and they had all these gr-
is that right
i really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked
the union
yeah
and right now anybodys thats laid off from $unc$g $unc$m will have a full years paycheck
i just read this in the paper the other day
is that right
plus probably an additional $unc$six months through the workers stuff that they have through the company
so im sorry its happening because its going to hurt
yeah
but i dont feel as sorry for them
if my husband were laid off tomorrow wed get $unc$one more check
really the
and that would be it
yeah
really the ones its going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area
yes
yeah
thats already hurting
thats the ones thats going to hurt because they depend on that
but i think theres a case where benefits have gotten
they voted them in
and they got so good like $unc$two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things
yeah
yeah
and it made the prices of cars go up
and the
uh-huh
i believe in unions
but they went too far
ill tell you ive had my fill of unions
i cant make $unc$eighteen dollars an hour
i
i know someone out here that makes $unc$eighteen dollars an hour
yeah
okay
do you want to go ahead
or
sure
i went to school at $unc$madison for $unc$two years
and they are really big on womens rights and equal treatment
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so ive seen a lot of rallies and things like that
but im not that liberated
i mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned
uh-huh
you pick up some traits from her and stuff
but i think its interesting and better for women to see that theres more of them doing mens fields
i like to see that
and i dont like to see women waiting on men hand and foot
right
but i believe in sharing and doing things for each other
i do too
i like the idea
i see a lot more
my children i have $unc$five children
and theyre all married
uh-huh
and i love seeing the men help the women so much
right
and they both cooperate together on
i think its great
me too
i hope that happens to me someday
i dont mind doing stuff
i have a boyfriend
and i got to make him dinner and stuff
but hell help me do the dishes
i dont want to expect to help to clean up then after
right
yeah
thats right
thats right
yeah
ive always taught my men that
they better clean up with their women and help them
if they did that
right
and theyre good about it
but it is neat to see them all work together
and a big thing that i see most of the women getting married now have gone back to
uh-huh
they stay at work or go back to work or whatever
right
and theyre well educated
uh-huh
and i believe well see a lot more c e o in companies
theyre having a fit about how little there are
oh
and i think well see a lot more dont you of upper management then we do now even
yeah
uh-huh
right
i think itll escalate
yeah
and i think black women now
in fact i work at a high school
uh-huh
and boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted
and shes very sharp
and i think that th-
and the ethnic thing is a good thing now
me too
theyre moving them up
and theyre sharp
and they
so youre going to see a lot more of that in leadership i believe
yeah
i like to see that
i think its really neat to see and all that educated minority person who really knows what theyre talking about
uh-huh right
and its just too bad that some people still look down on them just because of their color
right
thats a shame
especially black women
yes
yeah
but they wouldnt know what theyre doing
right
but im not big on subserving as far as to the men at all
uh-huh
right
but i never have gone along with that even far back
but i was brought up pretty good in a home that
years ago my mother was that way
the same
i
my bo-
ther-
some people say the boys shouldnt have to do those jobs the inside jobs
but we never were taught
they had to do as much as we did
so that was good
right
same here
yeah
so i think thats good to keep the equal as far as not necessarily by sex type thing
right
same here
you should be able to accomplish as much
and i think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
uh-huh
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you can do it
yeah
if he can do it you can do it type thing
yeah
exactly
i see more men participating in the family things with children helping to take care of them more and doing the jobs equally
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
what about politics on it
oh
do you think the political scene
im not that big on politics
im not that educated on it
yeah
im
im kind of disgusted this year because i dont see many women into the political scene
and i really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do and even for $unc$president and $unc$vice $unc$president this year
yeah
i agree with that
theres nobody again
i think theyre all scared out after
what was the ladys name that ran a couple of
fitz-
i forget her name now
i dont know
but you know who i mean
yeah
i know who youre talking about
yeah
she took such a rough go of it
and their tax deal and
yeah
at least she was strong to try it and
right
right
so thats good
but i wish they would get some more on that
i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that theyre talking about
i didnt see any of the women in there
uh-huh
and that disappoints me
oh
and right now i dont think we have too many in the forefront
schroeders about the biggest $unc$one in $unc$washington
uh-huh
$unc$congress woman
and other th-
we really
okay
i think the first thing they said
i have written this down
so it would
do you think its possible to have honesty in government or an honest government
okay
youre asking what my opinion about whether its possible to have honesty in government
yeah
i suspect that it is possible
i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
right
thats a good point
but other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
thats interesting
i had read something $unc$one time
and it was just applying to governments in general
it was written many years ago
it said that its impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers
and i thought that was interesting
it wasnt just talking about our government
it was just government in general from times past on
uh-huh
and
so theyre saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers
right
and that would be a next question to ask
or are they in there for their own gains
and personally i feel theres probably some of each
right
yeah
but i think maybe a lot of them
say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more matter of not what can i steal while in an office but how many friends can i make while im in office
uh-huh
yeah
and how good a name can i make for myself and so forth
so i guess it would be like anything else
yeah
the president of $unc$general $unc$motors probably has the same
yeah
and they talked
the other lets see
third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on
then they
thats hard to answ-
i agree with you theres a lot in business
i think thats very normal that we should not ex- i think
i think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be more to the point
i think we put too much on politicians
we expect them to only be there to serve us
yeah
if you knew what you were getting when you voted
thats a problem isnt it
yeah
its interesting
because im taking a $unc$texas government class right now
and $unc$one of the things
its so easy to blame them to
a lot of times i think its our own fault
they lie to us because we dont want to hear the truth
yeah
they say you get the government you deserve
and it
if they tell us the truth we dont elect them especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about peoples past
uh-huh
and i dont know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore
its hard to imagine
because i think its gotten just care-
were not talking about issues were talking about somebodys personal life
and were getting away from what we ought to be looking at
yeah
and it almost seems like in order to avoid some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find say in the $unc$bobsy twins or something like that
right
i also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out
i dont think there would be too many left
youre taking a government course
uh-huh
at what
the university
its $unc$t $unc$c $unc$j $unc$c
$unc$tarrant $unc$county $unc$junior $unc$college
oh
yeah
okay
and its really enjoyable
i like it
and then they also do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption
and i dont think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
you can make laws against corruption
yeah
but that doesnt mean
but that doesnt eliminate it does it
i dont think making laws will stop it
i dont know how many laws you would have to have
theyve got laws against cannibalism but that didnt stop that guy in $unc$milwaukee did it
no
sure didnt did it
so no
i think you can legislate
but i think theres no way that you eliminate it all by legislating
and we would end up with so many more laws that
i just think thats human nature that youre going to have corruption in government in business personal life
actually i think other countries may have it worse
the japanese government is always having some kind of a scandal
right
usually involving the $unc$prime $unc$minister or people very close to him
yeah
yeah
i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes
but when i think about where id want to go this is still the best
or i can
yeah
ive been around to a few other countries
and i have not found $unc$one yet that i would rather live in
i think
yeah
yeah
at its worst i think weve got the best
hello
hello
hi
hello
this is lois
hi
hi
this is $unc$lisa
and i called from the $unc$t $unc$i $unc$data $unc$base $unc$calling $unc$instructions
uh-huh
yeah
i got a call yesterday too
this is a different subject though
yeah
this is about changes in the women in the
uh-huh
theres really a lot isnt there
yeah
i think there really is
its kind of an easy thing to talk about
i guess the work force would be the main wouldnt it
yeah
i think you have to push $unc$one
and then we can start recording it
okay
all right
okay
are you ready now
yes
okay
like i said i guess it would be the work force as far as changes in the generations
yes
i know because i know when my mother was going into the work force there wasnt very many opportunities for her i guess
shes in her late forties
you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids
and ive never faced that at all
no
i think now you go to work when theyre $unc$six weeks old
uh-huh
and you stay there
and i feel like the next generation youll probably just work right along with your husband
yeah
uh-huh
i think its definitely gotten better
i do to much
and its just going to get better
uh-huh
it really is
because women are in every field now
i cant think of a field that theyre not involved in
i cant either not a $unc$one
and i know at least in the medical field it seems like theyve come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field
uh-huh
i dont think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
yeah
even in $unc$washington there seems to be a lot more women involved
yeah
hopefully the next generation it wont even be an issue
people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman
yeah
yeah
i think that would be the best goal
i do too
just your qualifications
and that would be it
uh-huh
exactly
not what color you are how old you are what youre male or female
that would be wonderful
i guess its kind of an ideal world though
yeah
i kind of think maybe in time that youll go by social security numbers
yeah
and that way they cant say they picked a male over a female female over a male
exactly
or the way you look
or the way you
yeah
yeah
your age or anything
i think that would be a wonderful way to do it
i do to
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you have
uh-huh
and then
and then if you get it then
uh-huh
also with women in the work force theyve gotten a lot more options as far as whats it called job sharing
uh-huh
if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
yeah
as a matter of fact thats what im doing
is it
uh-huh
it sure is
that would be great
it sure is
or a lot of women i know now and $unc$one of my supervisors when she went on $unc$l $unc$o $unc$a to have her baby we hooked up a terminal at her house
and we could send her messages
and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house
oh
i would just take her the actual paperwork once every week or $unc$two
and that worked out great too
yeah
yeah
that is
and thats a real attractive option if you have the technology for it
uh-huh
all it was
she just used a phone modem
and she was sitting in the office
so i think thats real nice too to come up with different options
do you like the job sharing
i do
do you
i really do
i think its great
do you work like half days or half weeks or
$unc$one week shell work $unc$three days and ill work $unc$two
and shell work $unc$two
thats great
and we just share off like that
uh-huh
do you get the full benefits
uh-huh
yeah
we get the full benefits
thats wonderful
but weve just really got a wonderful system that were working under
yeah
especially with children and so many things going on that would be great
yeah
it really is
and that way were not really missing any thing out of children
either way
uh-huh
yeah
you have your career and your home life
and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children
it is
it is
both of ours is school age
but we dont want to miss any of those $unc$p $unc$t $unc$a and all of that
uh-huh
no
i think
yeah
my sons just in day-care
but even that they have extracurricular activities
and the older they get the more that youre involved in that
uh-huh
i think its great
i really
yeah
and i look for more of that in the next generation
i do too especially as women get up in management and can be in on those decision making
when that subject comes up they can say yes
that would be wonderful
yes
i do too
plus i bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because youve got $unc$two days off that you can do everything
so you dont have to unless youre just really sick or the childs sick
most of the time now its just the weekend
or just forget it
uh-huh
yeah
i have to plan way in advance because
or what ive done is found doctors and dentists office with extended hours
uh-huh
thats been real helpful too
my doctor stays open til $unc$nine in the evening
so thats real helpful
so you dont have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour
i dont know how many times ive done that to do something post office or the bank or any kind of errand
to do
yeah
so
uh-huh
i think weve really come a long way in that because
uh-huh
i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just
its always been that way
uh-huh
but i know
yeah
but i can remember back growing up my mother
it was
she always worked
but it wasnt that easy for her to just take off
no
i can remember my mother getting in trouble if $unc$one of was sick
and i know she probably didnt make hardly anything compared to the work that she did
yeah
i think there is still some discrimination there where men and women work in the same job
i think men get paid more
i do too
but i think thats improving
its such a slow process
its frustrating
but you can see that its wrong
yes
yes
and you just want to make it right
but at least the wheels are moving forward
they really are
yeah
i think its getting better not worse
i should probably get back to my job
i know
i know the feeling
call again
okay
i sure will
bye-bye
okay
bye-bye
hello
hello
hey how you doing
not bad
not bad
whats your name
$unc$fernando
$unc$fernando
my name is $unc$nick
wait
let me turn off my stereo here
sure
because ive been waiting for about $unc$ten minutes to get connected to somebody
really
yeah
phew
man im
yeah
what time is it over th-
are you in $unc$dallas
no
no
im in $unc$detroit
or not $unc$detroit im in $unc$california
are you
yeah
i
because every time i got through i went to $unc$dallas $unc$texas
really
yeah
im in $unc$north $unc$carolina
oh
youre on the
lets see
on the other coast
yeah
$unc$twenty-one
yeah
shoot man its what midnight almost
what
yeah
yeah
its
im watching $unc$saturday night live here
yeah
okay
all right
i guess were supposed to talk
what about
credit card
wait
how did you get to know about the $unc$t $unc$i thing
$unc$one of my instructors said that they were doing something like this
and
what are you working on
a $unc$masters in information systems
really
im doing my $unc$masters in computer science and computer engineering
yeah
where at
at $unc$north $unc$carolina $unc$state $unc$university
hey
how do you like it out there
i dont because i come from a bigger city than this one
and im in $unc$raleigh
yeah
and
oh
$unc$raleigh $unc$durham
yeah
yeah
that area
and its really small
all you have is like towns built around universities
uh-huh
like $unc$chapel $unc$hill
yeah
so its basically a bunch of small towns anyway
kind of quaint little towns
but they dont have a whole lot there
yeah
where you at
im in $unc$monterey $unc$california right now
yeah
okay
its like this town probably has $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand people
and thats about it
$unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$fifty
yeah
okay
its a lot bigger than $unc$monterey is
but were just south of $unc$san $unc$jose and $unc$san $unc$francisco
okay
and its only a hour away to a large city
where do you go
do you go to $unc$berkeley
no
no
its the naval postgraduate school out here
okay
because i was looking at the doctorate degree in computer science center at $unc$berkeley
uh-huh
and theyre asking for a g p a of like $unc$three point $unc$seven or something like that
uh-huh
and theyre looking for $unc$g $unc$r $unc$e like $unc$ninety-nine percentile and this and that
yeah
and its like
thats what they look for
whether or not they get it is hard to say
yeah
i know
thats why i didnt apply
for me it was practically impossible to get between $unc$ninety and $unc$ninety-nine percentile on the verbal part
yeah
yeah
its pretty tough
its pretty tough
i
lets face it
and i did the
as far as
i found it a lot of times with regards to education the school only takes you so far
its what you do you know
yeah
so i dont lose any sleep over stuff like that
are you going to go for your $unc$doctorate
probably not
im in the $unc$navy
yeah
and most of the $unc$navy funds that i probably wont do it until i
if i do do it it will be after i get out of the $unc$navy
when do you get out
probably be another $unc$twelve years
okay
i like what im doing right now
but what if they pay for it
excuse me
what if they pay for
if they pay for a $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d
yeah
nah
they wont pay for it
i think they have maybe $unc$two people a year go get their $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d
because i know a couple of people here that work for the $unc$army
yeah
they civilians or military
i think theyre military
but mean the guy is still in
uh-huh
uh-huh
and he works over in $unc$maryland
uh-huh
and so hes doing his $unc$masters here
they gave him a scholarship for a year
yeah
and hes doing it in a year and a summer
uh-huh
and so hes getting that
and they said they got a lot of benefits and that
yeah
thats why you want to join
uh-huh
but this guy
you can earn a lot more money
so you say
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once youve get your $unc$masters
uh-huh
they go they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
so
a lot of times its not the money that keeps people in
yeah
they like what theyre doing
they feel good about what theyre doing
that type of thing
its more
but you
the
once you get your $unc$masters you can be earning anywhere between $unc$thirty-seven $unc$forty-five $unc$thousand a year
uh-huh
and thats not what theyre paying
easily
im sure
no
it depends on what rank you are of course
yeah
yeah
i know
like i say if youre at an upper level in the rank category youre probably pulling down close to $unc$seventy grand a year
yeah
but thats
yeah
those are few and far between though
yeah
its like in $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
in $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m you can get certain points
uh-huh
and everyones a manager
but nobody can get $unc$one more point to become whatever you need to earn so much money
yeah
since i imagine its fairly competitive
yeah
its like
no
$unc$i $unc$b $unc$m is like
theres a joke about $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m which says its like
all the major companies get into a boating race right
uh-huh
and so $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m says we have to have a team right
uh-huh
and then they come in last
and they have this whole team analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
yeah
saying
he goes the problem was that there were $unc$five people saying row row row and $unc$one person rowing right
so he goes have you come up with a solution
they go yeah
change the rower
its like everyones a manager
but its like $unc$one person does the work
yeah
so
too many chiefs and not enough $unc$indians
yeah
yeah
i dont know
that can really slow you down
yeah
thats the way it works
thats why theyre having problems
everyones a manager
and
i didnt realize that
yeah
its like the people that actually do the work there are very few
uh-huh
and then the other people just plan it
its like have you ever seen the commercial for $unc$federal $unc$express with the think tank
push paper around
uh-huh
all these people are just sitting around just going what shall we do
has anybody thought of anything
no
and then this guy from $unc$federal $unc$express comes along
they go whats that this track which its going around the world
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
uh-huh
and so its the same thing with $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
so they have this think tank
and they got to come up with ideas
but the thing is that $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
yeah
yeah
theyve got basically a lock on a lot of the market
yeah
and a lot of times you figure with the support that they provide
people generally go with that because they figure that you probably wont get fired for getting $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m material
whereas if you try something different theyll say yeah
and it fails
and youre dead
why didnt you try something more mainline
yeah
$unc$i $unc$b $unc$m doesnt fire anybody
because what they do is they put you in a different job which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything
no
uh-huh
so you quit
thats their policy
they never fire anybody unless youre caught doing something illegally
illegal or something like that
yeah
yeah
if youre stealing something or doing anything like that
uh-huh
but they wont let you off
what theyll do is
suppose youre a manager
so theyll put you into keeping up the paper
uh-huh
its like how much paper is going in
and then you say thats not my job
uh-huh
so you quit
so in other words thats the way they force people out
right
thats why they can say theres no layoff policy
right
but they dont really say that
youre always going to have great career conditions
right
hey thats kind of sad
no
but its like they have just different policy
i dont know
my dad works for them
but its like in their commercials they never put down any other company
its like they wont say
no
theyre the standard right now
or as far as that goes people think of computers they think of $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m a lot of times
and the main
yeah
because what happens is they have a good backup policy
and anybody can fix it
uh-huh
and so thats what youre going to go for
yeah
thats a big thing
and its like for example $unc$leading $unc$edge
have you ever heard of $unc$leading $unc$edge
yeah
they are out of $unc$korea right
what
$unc$leading $unc$edge
dont they pro-
they made small personal computers
yeah
small p c
theyre out of $unc$korea right
i dont know
i dont know
but what they did i dont know is buy all the parts that $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m would throw away and build an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m p c with all the parts that $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m would throw away
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
for example you test a chip
it cant last $unc$seven years
but it can last $unc$five
$unc$i $unc$b $unc$m says lets throw it away
$unc$leading $unc$edge will say well buy it from you
okay
and so thats
theyre still around i think
yeah
ive seen them around anyway
so thats what they do
they buy all the things that $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m throws away
and thats why theyre so compatible because
uh-huh
and by the time you have computer for $unc$five years youre going to throw it away anyway
most people do
or they have to anyway
theres
in a way you realize
$unc$one of my teachers got this computer which
its voice synthesizing stuff
uh-huh
and he got that
he said its like
i was testing it
and it was wonderful
and then when you tried to erase and correct all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
wow
and i want more
and its like jesus christ
its like why do you want more
because its $unc$one second of recording
you put into $unc$wave
uh-huh
and you want to correct the errors into $unc$wave
it takes so much
its like
of course it does
by the times it transforms into $unc$wave by mark off model
and you put it in there
and you want to correct those
and then youre trying to make the $unc$wave smooth
so you can approximately
of course its going to take a lot
imagine what it is for us to make mark off models
its amazing
yeah
its like jesus christ
when you get right down to it the more they can do for you the more memory theyre going to require
yeah
yeah
yeah
both in terms in $unc$ram as well as standard memory or disk base
yeah
so
like they say nobody can get enough
its like once you have something
and its like
yeah
you find out more
i was watching this program on t v yesterday
in $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-six $unc$nasa came up with $unc$three d graphics
yeah
right
uh-huh
and they were showing this $unc$three $unc$d graphics view of
like the deal
what
no
no
no
like a hologram
this is like video game stuff
with just graphics on a
okay
okay
but the only thing was that it was just lines
okay
like if you
i guess im going to school while im working at $unc$t $unc$i
so theres not a whole a lot of time that ive got for hobbies it seems like lately
but $unc$one of the things that i do when ive got some spare time is i do some woodworking
and that i guess ranges anywhere from carpentry work to some types of furniture and i dont know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on
and i made some candle sconces that you hang on the
yeah
i have quite a few of those that my uncle made
theres something about working with wood that i enjoy that
i dont know if its the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood
but
as you know i think its more like the mess you make isnt it
you dont have to worry about cleaning it up
yeah
because its out there
i dont have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that
but then i get the opportunity to vacuum
so i guess i get some of both
what are some of your things you like to do
when i have time i do like to sew
i had been doing a lot of crocheting
i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them
yeah
my mother was real heavy into crafts
and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing
and then she would go to these arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
yeah
so a lot of times id help her with that
i havent had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately
weve been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going
yeah
its a good time for gardening
yeah
its been beautiful this last week
but
i could do with a little less wind
but i think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
yeah
do you find you do most of your crocheting or your knit work around $unc$christmas time
i usually start in the fall
yeah
and my husband says i do it make afghans so i can keep my lap warm
thats kind of what my wife says
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because shes always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it
yeah
i know it seems like she
i think she made $unc$three this year $unc$one for my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters
so those things they take some time to make
yeah
i found $unc$one thats real easy
its
shoot i cant even remember the name of it now
but you make it in strips
and its real easy to do
and its just that it doesnt keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
but its
thats kind of like quilting
yeah
yeah
i think tha-
$unc$mile a $unc$minute
thats the name of it
$unc$mile a $unc$minute
$unc$mile a $unc$minute
im not sure what she does
i
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of afghan
i guess that is your standard knitting isnt it
yeah
yeah
usually single crochet always starts it off
yeah
i know
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other dont worry about it
we have a very small phone company down here
okay
and my husband says thats called rinky-dink
instead of call waiting or call anything else
no
no
we cant have that down here
we get disconnected all the time
i guess thats $unc$one way to end a conversation
yeah
it gets a little aggravating
ive got kids all over the $unc$united $unc$states
and sometimes they get disconnected when im talking to them
yeah
what
have you started your garden yet
yes
we planted potatoes and onions and bell peppers
boy
what else did i get in there
and jalapeno peppers
yeah
always got to have those
yeah
i think i had $unc$four jalapeno plants last year
i think $unc$one of them died
but i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because there is no way that i can eat all of those
nobody else in the family likes them
but always got to keep those planted
yeah
my husband doesnt like them either
but i can always give them away
thats kind of the way i am
besides theyre fun to grow
i planted zucchini last year
i planted $unc$four hills of them
i think i had $unc$three or $unc$four seeds in each $unc$one of them
and those things just flat took over
it wasnt until late i guess in the summer
maybe it was because it was too dry
they finally started making zucchini
and im not sure when a good time to plant those is if they should be planted early or later
it seems like all i got was
supposedly after the soil warms up
i would think so
seems like they all went to leaf
and it wasnt until late in the summer they started making fruit
so i dont know if i
$unc$mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon
uh-huh
but i hadnt looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
i doubt if zucchini is in there
it may not be
it may not be
probably the same time the other squash is though
you think theyre later in the year
yeah
about the same time that you plant okra because its supposed to be warm
thats true
most of the okra that is growing around higher is later okra
yeah
well thats about
we decided this year
go ahead
im sorry
go ahead
i was just going to say its a little over $unc$six or $unc$seven minutes
so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding im
that would be fine
just any time
all right
i guess well call this $unc$one quits
and thanks for participating
all right
ive enjoyed talking to you
all right
have a good time
okay
bye
bye
you said you have $unc$four cats
yes
i have $unc$four cats
how old are they
they range from lets see about a year and a half to $unc$nine years old
gosh
yes
i havent had my oldest one quite $unc$nine years
ive had him probably $unc$five years
okay
you get so attached to them
yes
i love my cats
i lost $unc$one $unc$one time
oh
the first $unc$one i got
he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment
no
and hed never been outside by himself outside
uh-huh
and it started raining
and i was hysterical
i was
you would have thought a child had died
yes
uh-huh
i called everyone i knew
i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat
yes
i understand
and they laughed at me
they thought that was so hysterical
no
i understand
weve gone through the same things with ours
theyve been ill
i take off work to take care of my cats
yeah
my boss thinks im absolutely crazy
and then we had a baby
and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby
the cat was here first
so i know
its hard
and then when we go to sleep at night its like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all $unc$four of them up there with us
how funny
its like all right whose corners is this one
thats sweet
i have the $unc$two
the other $unc$two cats i have are outdoor cats
uh-huh
and they didnt used to be actually
but they got kind of wild and werent doing very well inside
so i put them outside once i got a house
and theyre doing great out there
they love it
but the first one i got he doesnt want anything to do with outside unless youre there
uh-huh
other than that he gets scared to death
if you shut that door he goes into hiding
no
i think its from the time he jumped off the balcony
yes
uh-huh
thats it
and $unc$lord knows what happened to him
hes probably been through all kinds of nightmares
right
traumatized for life here
probably
yeah
weve
all $unc$four of ours are house cats
are they
we started out with $unc$two outdoor cats
but our neighbor decided he didnt like cats and shot $unc$one of them
no
he lived through it
i couldnt believe it
we went through $unc$twenty-two $unc$hundred dollars worth of vet bills
my gosh
the cat almost died
but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat
he loves life now
i imagine
and hes like thank you so much
i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
i know
we wondered about that
but that was a traumatic experience for us too
i can imagine
what did he shoot him with
from what we can tell it was a pellet gun
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
my gosh
people are crazy
yes
absolutely nuts
but luckily enough we found the cat in time and rushed him to the vet
and it took us about $unc$six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
and tod-
$unc$lord
he started off as a stray
and then we did all this for him
man
but hes been a wonderful cat
i imagine
they usually are after something like that happens to them
it seems to mellow them or something
yes
but we wouldnt have them
i dont see us without pets without cats
no
they just fill this void
yeah
i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i cant take care of them as well because theyre outside
uh-huh
and it worries me that $unc$one day $unc$one of them wont come back
yes
and i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things
but i cant give them up
no
i go hysterical when they dont come home
right
and you worry about whos taking care of them
yeah
and every time you see $unc$one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat
uh-huh
and you go crazy thinking it might be yours
right
i didnt realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought $unc$one home $unc$one night
i had $unc$one we had to put to sleep he got so sick
uh-huh
and i fell in love with this its a $unc$chinchilla $unc$persian and brought him home
ugh!
and my husband just died
really
it was like we cant take it back
weve got to keep it now
its here now
we have to keep it
yeah
my first $unc$one that i got
i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment
it took me about $unc$two weeks to realize that was real lonely
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
so i found this one
and actually it was on a sign at $unc$taco $unc$bell drive-thru that said free kittens
uh-huh
and i thought well thats interesting
ill call them
right
and he was the only $unc$one left
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure shed gotten all her kittens
uh-huh
and he was the last $unc$one she carried across
the whole big sad story
oh
so of course i had to take him
i felt so sorry for him after that
right
right
and you can tell he was weaned too young because hell nurse on your ears and your fingers
no
yeah
he
i asked the vet why he did that
and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed
so
yeah
but he is the lovingest cat
people who dont even like cats like him
oh
he never meows
he doesnt have any front claws
i had him declawed
uh-huh
but he doesnt bite anybody
hes just kind of there real friendly and docile
thats good
we just love them
they get to feeling so lovey and dovey
and theyll come up and just start kneading in our chest
and its like your claws need trimming
yeah
yeah
we call that doing biscuits
yes
yes
it looks like theyre kneading bread
it just drives us nuts
i just love cats
i like dogs
theyre okay
i had a dog when i lived at home
yeah
but theyre a lot more trouble than cats actually
they really are
the cats are so independent
and they have so much more personality than a dog
yeah
they do
but theyre so much fun to watch them play
they are
i love it
its so funny to get more than $unc$one cat together because it brings out their personalities
yes
and they just act so funny
weve got
the $unc$two that were outside theyre like brothers
ive never seen $unc$two cats so close
really
and they will get to playing chase through the house
uh-huh
and it is hysterical
and then the other $unc$two cats will follow in pursuit
its like this train
a train of cats running around
it sounds like a train
we have wooden floors
and so it just sort of echoes through the house
how funny
i can imagine
yeah
i wouldnt give anything for my cats
i love them to death
no
theyre wonderful
what are your cats names
we have $unc$bonzo $unc$bear $unc$poindexter and $unc$felix
how sweet
and what do you have
i have $unc$xanadu and $unc$precious and $unc$rascal
oh
$unc$precious and $unc$rascal are brother and sister
and they dont look a thing a like
nothing
$unc$precious is a medium hair yellow cat
uh-huh
yeah
and $unc$rascal is a black and white short hair
nothing
they dont look a thing a like
not a thing goodness gracious
and they came from the same litter and everything
we have tortoise which is a black and orange
oh
and shes so ugly
so ugly shes cute
right
yes
uh-huh
you cant help but love her
shes the oldest $unc$one but very possessive
really
its like nobody messes with her mamma
oh
and it comes bedtime
and shes right there
is she the oldest one
yeah
shes the oldest
and she
in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also
really
and so yeah
its
wouldnt have
if something happens to her
i know
its like the end of the world
it will be
i know thats how i am about $unc$xanadu
goodness
you get so attached to them
definitely
my mother has dogs
and im like no
yeah
this is nothing like cats
you can walk a dog
and thats okay for weekend
but cats are good all the time
right
im so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldnt have worked
it wouldnt have
no
that would be a problem
thats $unc$one of the requirements i asked him
i said you do like cats right
we dont li-
have you seen those
do you ever read $unc$cosmo
yes
uh-huh
there was cartoon in $unc$cosmo about a year or $unc$two ago
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes
they had ripped him up
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom
he said of course i love cats
and they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole $unc$nine yards
it was so funny
yeah
the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats
are you getting rid of your cats
you cant be pregnant and have cats
im like no no no
watch me
right
the child will learn to like cats and deal with them
definitely
im sorry
we are not getting rid of the cats
i wouldnt either
thered be no way
the whole family was so disappointed
really
right
thats life
thats how life goes
right
but yes
we just love them to death
i know
i love mine too
its been nice talking to you
it was nice talking to you too
i enjoyed it
me to
bye
bye
bye
bye
you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
i suppose i do because ive seen a lot of those changes the changes that women have had in not even the last generation the last $unc$fifteen years $unc$twenty years going from
uh-huh
take it back $unc$thirty years
im going back too far from my parents generation when mom stayed home period
yeah
and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job unless
if you were educated you might teach for a year or $unc$two before you got married
yeah
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something
yeah
if you were a teacher then that was it until the kids were little
yeah
you werent supposed to want a job
yes
theres not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
yeah
and then of course today its supposed to be all the other way
youre supposed to only want the job
and your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care
yeah
and we have these wonderful people who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care
uh-huh
yeah
but a really good day care is probably going to cost more than youre going to make at the job
and well see how the generations go
yeah
i
at least for a lot of women depending on what she did
yeah
i was mechanical engineer with $unc$t $unc$i
and i did it for $unc$six years
and for $unc$one
i had $unc$one while i was pregnant
and then $unc$one while my oldest was a year old
and it just drove me crazy
did you
i could not do either well enou-
i couldnt put in enough overtime that was necess- or things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on $unc$saturdays as is needed because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with work for $unc$three months
uh-huh
yeah
and
so it was you and the kid
and your work schedule is
yeah
thats the thing
maybe if you get along
for example if youd been a technician instead of an engineer
the technicians work the $unc$eight to $unc$five job and know when theyre going to be there
yeah
might have been better
yeah
but if youre going to be more professional oriented then youve got to be able to perform well on the job
youve got to have the flexibility that doesnt really go with the family
yeah
and so it was
in my case i just decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
uh-huh
so you figure $unc$one of these days youre going to go back to being an engineer
is that what youre saying
actually ive found out that im not going to go back to being an engineer
what will you
im a photographer now
okay
youve found something else
i have branched out
i was a photographer before
but when i went to college i felt like i couldnt support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby
yeah
and im very mechanical
and mechanical engineering interested me
so i did that
and then i did that for $unc$six years
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that it was great
yeah
but i was bored part of the time too
and i wanted something else to do
yeah
you figure theres got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
yeah
its great while theyre really little
but as they get older and theyre more independent and theres things to do then its good for them to go to different
uh-huh
he goes to a mothers day out program now once a week
both of my kids do
and so they get the socialization with other kids and not really school but a different authority than mom once in a while kind of learning how to deal with society
and they need that to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day
yeah
i think they do too
and i need it for the break
yeah
thats the other thing
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work
still taking care of the children is a very important job
uh-huh
and someones got to do it and be able to do it right
and if its not mom then dad or somebodys got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
and enjoy it
thats the whole thing
yeah
i think thats the thing that were going to see
i think the biggest thing were going to see coming up in the next $unc$ten year even now theyre starting to do it
but i think its going to be more in the next $unc$ten to $unc$fifteen years is that theres going to be a lot of women
and theyre going to have to work it out to working part time
uh-huh
because if i had been allowed to work maybe $unc$thirty hours a week instead of $unc$fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there had been some way to work it out
yeah
because i liked my job really well
uh-huh
but i was just pulled in so many different directions
it was just driving me crazy
and now with the photography its working
thats what im doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the week and use those hours to do
yeah
the thing that im doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mothers $unc$day out programs and also soccer teams and different stuff like that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week
or my husband when hes at home can take care of them
yeah
so jobs have to i guess become more flexible
i think theyre really going to have to and not just for mothers for fathers as well
yeah
its going to have to be both
thats another thing that has to adapt is the fathers attitudes about whose job is this
yeah
its his job too
and i
to me the only important issue is the children
because as far as housework goes men can do housework just as easily as women
and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesnt take as much time as it used to
so
its just convincing your husband that its important enough for him to do it
yeah
conv-
yeah
just
yeah
con
yeah
because if he saw mom doing only that all the time he was growing up then its hard to think of it that i should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it
uh-huh
yeah
and you
yeah
you talk
yeah
yeah
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done
uh-huh
yeah
this is what you do it now
and a man might say out loud i understand this
and i agree
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him
yes
and
and thats a very hard attitude to change
yeah
and its just they dont look at things
most of the men dont walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
uh-huh
they just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down and in a while get around to it
and i think most women walk in and with got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this taken care of instead of having someone say now this is the time this needs to be done
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
but
and a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea someones got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in the right ideas to so that they know that male and female are both responsible for doing this
thats right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and
and i think thats going to show up a lot more now in the next generation of boys and girls
the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there
uh-huh
yeah
they were both working at whatever things needed to be done
uh-huh
theyre going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because its a womans job or a mans job but because its dirty and it needs to be clean
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but i think in between we got a generation of kids who didnt learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didnt move in to fill the gap
and so basically no one was taking the responsibility
and its going to
and i think thats happened in a lot of cases
yeah
some kids are really having it
if theyd been in day care the entire time and it wasnt
yeah
the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college
uh-huh
some time day care is really good
yeah
but sometimes its baby-sitting
yeah
its someone keeping an eye on the kids
but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say heres whats right
yeah
and heres what wrong
and heres what we expect of you
yeah
i think that was $unc$one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
yeah
this is the way i feel about this
and this is the way because that
if you teach them when theyre little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you add onto it as they get older
uh-huh
but if no one does anything when theyre little then its twice as hard i think as they get older
yes
im saying this as im trying to keep my $unc$nine month old from trashing something
yes
i understand
i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls
yeah
shes usually in bed by this time
but shes staying up late tonight
but
yeah
i want to have a relationship with her
my dad was a very traditional dad
and when i was a child i didnt really know my dad very well
and i miss that
and i want
thats the thing
like we said if womens roles change drastically mens roles will too
yeah
but men have to be convinced of that
and a lot of its for the better
some of the womens roles i think are almost for the worse because were losing out on some things going back to work
but i think if we can expand the mens roles at the same time like youre taking care of your child and your dad probably didnt very often
no
i know mine almost never did
uh-huh
okay
movies
i havent seen too many lately
i have kids
and we went and saw the rescuers down under over the break
uh-huh
do you have kids you take to movies
or
no
no kids
yeah
its a $unc$walt $unc$disney movie
and it didnt get as good a reviews as the little mermaid their last $unc$one and got all kinds of $unc$academy $unc$awards and things last year
but this $unc$one i thought was excellent
the
was that the animated version
yeah
its animated
and i cant believe how good theyre getting with their animation now
its just the special effects
and in this movie theres this boy
and he rescues this bald eagle
and its a huge eagle wing span of $unc$twenty feet or something like that
and the boy actually rides on his back
and he rides through the clouds
and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out
and theyre flying all over with it
and i know there must have been computers or something for animation this day
but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation
it was a good show
even better than $unc$roger rabbit insofar as animation
$unc$roger was a composite $unc$one
yeah
theres a movie ive seen $unc$roger rabbit
thats not a recent movie
but i enjoyed that show
yeah
that was made i dont know several years back i guess
yeah
yeah
latest one ive saw which was a mistake to go see was $unc$lionheart
had $unc$claude $unc$van $unc$damme
uh-huh
of course i guess hes trained in this martial arts of some sort
but the plot was bland
the acting was bland
it was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
chop them up
yeah
chop them up
exactly
and
this is supposed to be the guy thats replaces $unc$bruce $unc$lee or whatever or the next $unc$chuck $unc$norris type of guy
yeah
or hes singular i guess
you know how they can make any single $unc$one of them in a movie to be a superstar of any sort
uh-huh
superstar
uh-huh
but $unc$chuck $unc$norris of course could be just about equal if not more
uh-huh
and all of them i guess could be in that fashion or category
$unc$uh-huh
uh-huh
it was about a $unc$french $unc$foreign $unc$legion fellow who deserts to go help his brothers wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs
and he got killed
really uplifting
so he deserts and goes to $unc$new $unc$york
and he starts out by fighting to make money
and then he moves on to $unc$l $unc$a to where she is to just help him out
uh-huh
the $unc$hollywood really must think theres some real dummies out there or something
i dont know
yeah
i hadnt heard much about that movie
i
other than it was a chop them up movie
but i guess thats $unc$one i wont go see
it was worth the buck i guess
you went to the dollar movie
yeah
yeah
they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out
theyre usually not that great or didnt do that great anyway
a lot of
let me see
let me see
another movie i watched
i want to see that new $unc$one that won all those $unc$academy $unc$awards this year dances with wolves
uh-huh
i havent seen that
have you seen that $unc$one yet
yeah
what
i absorbed all of that movie in $unc$one sitting
i guess what made it so good was the cinematography
the wide open the spaces
yeah
and the music
and it had an excellent story line
everything about it was good
uh-huh
i thought an excellent one too was misery with $unc$kathy $unc$bates and $unc$james $unc$caan
im not a $unc$james $unc$caan fan
but that was a well directed and acted movie
is that right
id recommend it
its a little on the violent side
uh-huh
but then what movie isnt anymore
right
right
yeah
our movies today it used to be x
and $unc$p $unc$g used to be $unc$r
and seems like the rating system is kind of switching that way a little bit
i have no objections to it
its just
and its a matter of your taste
yeah
yeah
yeah
its just that
yeah
its just that the rating system seems instead of having x now they have what $unc$n $unc$c $unc$seventeen
yeah
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it
so
and even on those type they dont show what you expect
right
a lot of those are really violent type movies
right
really gory
yeah
that seems to be the norm of most movies
but what the hey
yeah
this is $unc$america
let me see
$unc$one movie i saw i guess it was a while back red $unc$october
yeah
have you seen that $unc$one
yes
i have
that was pretty good
yeah
i read the book before
so i knew the story line going in
but they changed some things in the movie
it wasnt the same
i thought the book was better than the movie
but i thought the movie was really good as well
i always wait for the movie
i dont have time to read the book
yeah
i dont
i read about $unc$one or $unc$two thick novels like that a year
uh-huh
thats about all the time i can spare
but that was a good show i thought
i read an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine
that wasnt a real submarine you saw in the water
it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the $unc$hollywood magic
yeah
all those underwater scenes
i thought
it looked to me like it was a real submarine that was in the water
they
thats the magic of $unc$hollywood special effects
yeah
i hear this movie $unc$f $unc$x part $unc$two coming out is pretty good
is that right
did you ever see the original one
i didnt
it was
you ought to rent the $unc$f $unc$x part $unc$one
it doesnt say part $unc$one
but its $unc$f slash $unc$x
whats that about
a special effects man who somehow gets involved in this
im not sure
i cant remember
its been a while since ive seen it
but he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
and he has to go underground
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
and
to fool people
and
right
and using makeup and using all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go
all the tricks
uh-huh
that sounds like an interesting concept
but you need to rent the first one first
to understand whats going on in the second
if that is that the second one follows the first
i dont know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one
uh-huh
theyre supposed to be coming out with all these $unc$desert $unc$storm movies this summer too
oh
i expected those
yeah
they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think
yeah
they had some
in some of those i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about $unc$lebanese and $unc$americans
uh-huh
and they decide make it $unc$iraqis and $unc$americans
and they just change the title and reshot a few parts where they could
i guess they figured we cant tell the difference between an
actual names will not be used
yeah
right
eventually im sure they will come out with the proper names
yeah
right
it was such a
it
i guess theyll probably come out with a lot of movies
it was such a rout though
i dont know
they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or about those $unc$two newsmen or whatever that got captured
latest story
uh-huh
$unc$kevin $unc$costner i understand is supposed to play $unc$schwartzkopf supposedly
is that right
i dont know
thats just $unc$one of the many rumors that floats around
yeah
or what you read
uh-huh
i think weve probably
pretty much used up the tape i guess
yeah
yeah
its been about $unc$five minutes
its been nice talking with you
same
and well talk to you on the next go around
keep on watching those movies
okay
bye-bye
adios
are you going to tell me what youve been doing lately in the
sure
okay
ill offer anything that i can on the subject
my husband and i just moved here recently
and we bought this house about i dont know year and a half ago
what we have here now is just a basic $unc$three bedroom $unc$two bath brick house which is completely different from what i had had before
when i was working and before i married i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic old houses and things like that
so i tried to
i was in the process of renovating a house that was about $unc$seventy-five years old
my
so it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint
everything you can think of that house had to have
you are experienced i would say
i really did enjoy it
it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it
i agree
yeah
i have done something like that too only not nearly as extensive
uh-huh
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home after having a one that was historical looking
it is
it is
yeah
thats true
when i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time
and the town that i was living in only about $unc$eighty miles from here
so we
really it was just
the market was so good
we hadnt really planned on buying
and as you probably heard in the $unc$dallas and $unc$texas area period the housing market is just unreal
you can get things for such a song
yes
so thats really why we ended up in a house like this
this is not what we want to stay in forever because ive found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff
and im always just wanting to paint and wallpaper and redo and redo
uh-huh
so im ready to get ahold of another $unc$one that i can have a little more input into
so
maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money
yeah
thats the key
the thing is when we moved in they had just painted wallpapered new carpet and everything
so i feel sort of like its sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because im in the mood to do it
so well see how much longer were here
yes
we just moved to $unc$charlotte from $unc$enid $unc$oklahoma
uh-huh
$unc$oklahoma of all places
so i know of what youre talking about as far as the market was concerned
yeah
uh-huh
right
and ill tell you we had kind of a charming house
it was a cedar shake house and very weathered
yes
and it was about $unc$fifty years old but not really traditional looking particularly
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i tried to make it after i sold my business
i in
i spent almost $unc$three years redoing
yeah
and i considered it a full time job
it is
yeah
and when we did
we kind of had planned this trek to the east because were both originally from this part of the country
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
and so i think some of the things that i did paid off
for instance $unc$one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something i did on the outside
uh-huh
uh-huh
i love old estate sales
yes
yes
i happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house where the couple was very old and had gone into nursing homes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and all the men started going down to the barn
yeah
uh oh
and so i th-
shoot im going
thats where i need to go
yes
im going to the barn too
exactly
they auctioned some tools and things like that
yeah
uh-huh
but then they went over and started auctioning this big stack of bricks
oh
and so i thought gee ive been wanting to do some brick walkways for a time
uh-huh
work
right
right
uh-huh
it ended up after some pretty heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for $unc$forty dollars
uh-huh
my word
and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days
no
my word
but what we ended up with was about $unc$four $unc$thousand
for $unc$forty dollars
for $unc$forty dollars
my
and so what we did
we had built a deck on the back of that house
uh-huh
but it needed
and it was quite large into the yard
something
uh-huh
but on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together
uh-huh
so we made brick patios and walkways
right
how fun
how nice
and so for
and he did the digging which was about $unc$six inches
uh-huh
but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and placed most all the bricks
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
and it turned out beautifully
i bet
and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way
yes
it nearly killed me
yeah
but you did stagger back and say doesnt this look nice
i hated to leave it
let me ask you
when you laid those bricks
i know my parents bought a house about $unc$ten years ago
theyre fixing to sell it again and move again
theyre kind of
my moms like i am
shes a renovator a lover of old things
uh-huh
and they have to be doing something constantly
and the patio that came with that house was not laid on a
i dont know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks
no
we
but they have a problem with these little sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks
i
and of course you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks and things like that
no
i didnt have that trouble because we laid the
i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study
uh-huh
but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them
yeah
i see
because when you start
and we put them on a base of $unc$four inches of sand
okay
yeah
and then we swept sand in between
but it was an error to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever
uh-huh
you just put them together as close as you can
as tight as you can
thats probably because they had
every spring my mom says were going to have a barbecue and tell everybody guess what
were going to redo the patio
were going to pull up all the bricks
uh-huh
but they just havent brought themselves to do it
yeah
and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to
uh-huh
uh-huh
if it wasnt quite level or something id just get that rubber hammer and prob-
right
i think that they could
if they have problems with sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a fairly regular basis for a while anyway
uh-huh
yeah
right
right
the thing thats funny is theyve done things like that
ill catch her out there spraying around
and then its like in $unc$two days time theyll come home from work
and those little things are back
its just theyre the most resilient little characters
and so i dont know what theyre finally going to do
she may just
hopefully theyll sell the house and go somewhere else
i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are
and then she wont have to worry about it
and
what are these things
yeah
is it diazinon
or what is it that will
right
$unc$dursban or something like that
yeah
what it is thatll take care of them
$unc$dursban
i think in this area or most all areas they use for ticks and fleas
yeah
and theyre awful hard to do anything with
right
thats true
thats true
but my dad farms
and shes always telling him isnt there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs
yeah
but
i bet $unc$dursban would do it
it might do it
yeah
shes got just a gorgeous yard so many flowers and her $unc$four cats
so shes sort of real funny about what she sprays
yeah
i think you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very well before she lets her cats out or something like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
gosh $unc$deb we could talk all day couldnt we
i know
it just seems
as i said when i heard what the subject was i thought gosh i havent thought about what i went through at that other house in so long
ive been so busy
but i dont know
of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most
and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do
yes
but gosh i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house up the stairway even
wow
i just had a ball with it
oh
it was so much fun
good
yeah
and ive sworn up and down
my moms great grandparents had this huge victorian house in $unc$paris $unc$texas
and the $unc$one thing that she ended up with was the old door that was on the front door of that house
uh-huh
yes
and she has that up in her attic
and i have sworn that it
im going to find a house to put that door on before she does
so as far as looking toward the future thats my plan
im going to have to move fast i think though because as a
all right do you do exercise
i do
yes
i guess it actually changes
i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife
uh-huh
right
and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
and then moving up i run in the mornings
uh-huh
not every morning it probably averages about $unc$two days a week
right
and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isnt i understand quite exercising
but its along the lines
right
how about yourself
thats a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i dont always set out for them to be exercise
uh-huh
i walk with my parents occasionally
nothings real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule
and i play racquetball
but i havent since ive been out of school
i dont have anywhere to do that
but thats going to start soon again
uh-huh
and i play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
uh-huh
because i really dont like to exercise
i think thats the basic point of it is i dont enjoy it if i know that its exercise
right
but if its like a social activity or a recreational activity i dont mind
right
so i have to disguise it
its like feeding little babies food and telling them its something else so that theyll eat it
thats right
thats kind of the same thing for me
i have to not know that its exercise so i can do it
right
so you look at it more as a task
yeah
if its exercise its a task
right
i dont want to do anything i have to do
i see
ill voluntarily clean the bathroom
but i wont do it if i have to do it
right
right
im $unc$thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself
uh-huh
right
im $unc$twenty-two
and so its interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise
right
my job at $unc$texas $unc$instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i dont get any exercise doing that
right
and plus theres a build up of stress
uh-huh
so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner
and i need to go out in the morning and run
or ill just get nuts
right
so thats kind of a motivator
so even though i can look at it as a task i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying im lowering my chance of heart attack and that type stuff
right
eating right and no cholesterol and all that
sure
that all
i do all that
yeah
we
im sure i will do
im doing that more and more than i used to
yeah
im getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but its still at the task stage
right
is it a pleasure for you
or are you
its a
something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable
right
i do that at the end of the day
and it takes
during that time the stress from the day goes away
i get to share whatever i did with my wife and vice versa
right
going to the gym is actually something different than
and the running
and i enjoy that too
uh-huh
year
ive been running since high school on track teams and the like
oh
so running im at that point which you probably get to after about $unc$six months of dedicated running where you dont feel your muscles any more
uh-huh
right
and you dont think about the pain of it
you take the time to relax some how
and you think about other things
during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you cant breathe and this and that
uh-huh
and thats no fun
and its so hard to get past that for a lot of people
right
thats
i never got past that stage
yeah
the weight lifting on the other hand is actually
i think i look better
right
im not a huge person
im just a regular looking guy
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive
uh-huh
right
so that pays also
thats good
yeah
so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work with my wife which is nice
yeah
i love her
i enjoy being with her
uh-huh
i guess thats $unc$one thing
but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
right
thats it
i do the occasional push up and sit up
i havent really brought myself to go to the gym because thats very stressful to me
yeah
because i felt real competitive there
and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like theres all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
yeah
i dont let that bother me
but yeah
thats something that comes with time too
right
ill tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
uh-huh
its your own
youre struggling against your own body weight
right
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow
right
and you can actually get a good wo-
i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
uh-huh
thats a good idea
but i do have my ride
we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
is that right
ill do those once in a while just at $unc$eleven $unc$thirty when $unc$love connections on and i cant sleep
right
yeah
right
ill get up and stair step for half an hour
thats funny
yeah
its i guess pretty healthy
but i dont have a regular plan thats
yeah
i need to get started on that
maybe not
id say at $unc$twenty-two you dont necessarily need a plan as long as youre getting the exercise otherwise
right
when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan
uh-huh
and whats real funny about plans is that theres a struggle when you add a plan to your life
something else has to go away
uh-huh
and thats the hard decision is okay if im going to run in the mornings what do i trade it off for
the answers sleep right
sleep
if im going to walk at night what do i trade it off for
$unc$star $unc$trek
uh-huh
or its always trade offs
and as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing
yeah
its not just exercise but anything
its very hard
right
and i dont think you should worry about not having a program yet
thatll come some day when i
yep
yeah
i guess if you care or if your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps
right
i hope so
i think we covered it
yeah
sounds good
nice talking with you $unc$craig
yeah
you too
have a nice day
you too
good day
bye
bye
okay
what do you think is the biggest problem
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it
uh-huh
but its
i dont know
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way because the general values that were teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school
uh-huh
yeah
do you think its the values that theyre teaching in school or the values they get from home
the values more or less at home and the t v just a general
learning is not a revered endeavor really
its a lot more
its i wont say socially unacceptable
but whereas like in a person that stud-
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society
and i think that carries over to school a lot
right
so
yeah
i think that the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it
if
i think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the kids while were not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that and then expect them to pick it up at school
youre not going to do that
youre going to carry to school out into the world what you learned at home
and i think that that part of that showing up now with things because kids i think have probably less respect for people in other things than we may have seen in the past
yeah
and part of its the family i think
and part of its the living conditions certain people are subjected too
drugs is a big problem now
and i think thats another root problem
yeah
yeah
i wonder if thats a root problem or not
because i think about that a lot
and its just everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now
but i wonder
do you get the
thats kind of side tracked
but i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better
uh-huh
i thought of course theyre doing better and not so much when i was growing up
catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools
but they still had a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material
everybody that went to a catholic school at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it
right
right
and i wonder if not so much that
i think like you say its the socioeconomic mix
theyre
you look at the schools like that where youve got a lot of kids that might be more well off going to a private catholic school or whatever
and theyre not all that way
but some that are theyre not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city public schools
yeah
yeah
this is interesting because in my mind i dont have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment
but this was actually inner city
yeah
people were sending
just because their kids had the ability and the drive to try and get an education they didnt send him to a public school
like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where youre pressured not to learn in instance
yeah
in a lot of cases like that if kids are going to a public parochial school like that its because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education i think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well
and maybe they pick up on that
yeah
and then from the other aspect maybe the school itself has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller
they may be able to give the resources thats needed to do a good job
yeah
and what would you do to fix the school systems
thats a tough question how to fix the school system
yeah
with
i would try i guess to see about getting parents more involved try to come up with more ways to do that stress the importance of education to both the parents and the students and more classes i think that are
and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that arent getting taught at home and respect for other people
i think thats a big part of it
people
if you dont care about property and people youre not going to care about learning i think
yeah
youre not going to really care about yourself
yeah
thats what i was going to say
its the chicken and the egg thing
i wonder a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise
right
and you get
its been a while since i been in high school
theyre even in grade school when they do that
but i cant remember exactly what goes through their head when theyre doing that
but you got to think in a way its kind of a outward showing of that they dont think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school
and i
but thats not an easy task
thats why i say its a tough question what would you do
because even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when youre growing up in a home which may be just the pits
and you dont have any kind of a good environment to live in
its kind of hard to say you need to take care of other peoples stuff as well when you barely have anything yourself
so
yeah
i could see where that would be a problem
and i think its
okay
okay
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers im not a lawyer that i find a lot of things are so specialized that im not sure
and i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to
they can find guilt or innocence
right
but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate that they might leave it to somebody else who has expertise in that
right
i agree too
i dont think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down
i think the judges should
or even a panel of lawyers if it got to that point might be better than just regular civil people not knowing exactly what things are from murder on up to like tax stuff
uh-huh
yeah
because i find that
ive been on a few juries
and as a say i tend to be around civil cases because ive been an expert witness some
and many matters are so complicated that its so hard to come up with the fair value or the fair sentence
and $unc$one thing that you get if you have some expertise is the range of possible values or terms or how heinous was the crime
right
that
when i only do something $unc$one $unc$two or $unc$three times im hardly an expert on it
and most juries over a period of $unc$five or $unc$ten years you might sit on $unc$three
yeah
and
and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was worth $unc$five years or $unc$twenty-five
right
thats
yeah
and most people that do sit on juries
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if theyre that lucky sometimes or whatever the case may be and may not have any idea of what the standard punishment would be for it
uh-huh
yeah
and they may have some different idea
it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment didnt fit the crime or not long enough or whatever the case may be
uh-huh
yeah
i think the judges do have better knowledge of it
the only thing i worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name that is the defendant and sometimes might have more pull which does happen
uh-huh
we cant say it doesnt because it does happen
not everybody has the right morals sometimes
people can be paid off politically or whatever the case may be
uh-huh
and sometimes thats not real fair either though
so
$unc$one of the others things that gets me on the juries is that often in the newspaper i tend to hear $unc$two things that go on
$unc$one is you often see in the headlines the big numbers
uh-huh
and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an $unc$appeals $unc$court
right
and that never makes the press
and so when you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of whats what because we see the headlines
and we dont have again a lot of knowledge
so we dont know what is really going on what is really the range of sentences or awards that are actually in the end applied
right
right
also what i dont think is fair either is when you have say a rapist come in
and his attorney gets his sentencing reduced because hes gone to a lesser charge i dont know what assault or something or
uh-huh
but which doesnt make any sense to me either
i know its hard to prove rape and whatnot
and the person that was raped or whatever doesnt
i mean its embarrassing and all this other stuff
uh-huh
and theyre put on they were the ones that caused it or whatever
but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did
and you shouldnt be able to go on the lesser charge
i dont think thats right because alls thats going to do is say that was a breeze
i can go out and do it again and have the same thing happen
yeah
thats not right
thats where the role of juries is restricted
and im not sure id want to change that aspect of it
$unc$one is its restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually brought
right
if its first degree rape second degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that
okay this person has been charged with first degree rape
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that
uh-huh
such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether its premeditated or $unc$one or $unc$two of the lesser degrees
the other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been $unc$one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences that you usually dont get to hear all the information
yeah
its what information is presented
and i dont know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards
but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence
and to me how can you make a decision if you dont have all of the evidence in front of whether it pertains to the case or not
somebody thinks it had because theyve got it there
uh-huh
so the $unc$two lawyers are the ones that have all the information
yeah
and the truth thats brought out is as i say when ive heard about
dont they
the oath is to tell the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want
they dont want the whole truth
you can say
they only put part of it
yeah
yeah
the
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth
right
thats just like that old witness game
its a game kids play too
but somebody did it just for your train of thought where they showed something
and they asked
there were $unc$four people
hello
hello
my name is $unc$nola
im in $unc$plano $unc$texas
hi $unc$nola
im $unc$steve
im in $unc$dallas $unc$texas
not too far away
no
thats unusual
seems like usually
ive had some from $unc$plano too
yeah
i think all mine have been $unc$east $unc$coast people so far
uh-huh
okay
lets see
social changes
social changes
whats that mean
that sounds like not as recent social changes too back to the sixties or fifties i guess
yeah
think we can handle that
yeah
yeah
i definitely
theres plenty of things to talk about there
thats a
okay
shall i go ahead and push $unc$one
yeah
sure
okay
you want to go ahead and start
i was hoping that you would
but
oh
in social changes is that
it seems to me that
that involves a lot of different areas i think
does that
yeah
like a lot
it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today
yeah
there is a big difference in the economic status of people although i think that has been true always
s-
perhaps theres less of the middle range then there was
yeah
its like people are starting to give up hope
and they start out very poor
lets see
thats a bad tangent to get on
what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties
no
i think in my situation
i have $unc$three children
and were home schooling
so things that relate to education are things that i think about a lot
and i think that involves social changes a lot
for instance i think the schools are having more and more problems because of things that are happening socially in the world around them and because of their parents
and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather more not than are and children being put in day-care centers from very early
and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day-care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes
because of the way children are being raised theyre not learning the values they need to learn
yeah
and they dont have the self-esteem that they need to have
and they dont have a solid family life that they need to have to confidently deal with the things in the world
and i think were seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening
and
yeah
it seems so that
yeah
that is a pretty big change
it seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance
but it seems like some of these even ladies thatll work and have a baby and then after $unc$two or $unc$three months go back to work
yeah
yeah
its
thats very young for a baby
thats really sad
i think that a lot of people
and they think they have to
but
yeah
i think that if they really tried they wouldnt have to
and i think that if they didnt and it became more of the standard not to that i dont know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home know and have a more solid foundation for the kids
yeah
yeah
yeah
theyre going to
you said they might be saving money
even if they had to pay more now in the long run its going to cost society more to force $unc$two people to work even though its higher productivity is short-term
thats right
it already costs society much more because of it
it
trying to do all these programs like $unc$headstart and things like those you wouldnt have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them
yeah
theres
and i think a lot of it is selfishness
people have become very selfish
they dont want to stay home with the kids or something like that
yeah
there are a lot of $unc$two parent situations where the woman goes back to work because thats what she wants to do
rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment
rather than that she has to have the money particularly
or maybe theres a small need for money
so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
it
yeah
its interesting w-
home study is that what you said
home school
home school
yeah
is it like a preschool level then or through grade school or
no
i have $unc$one going into fourth grade and $unc$one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and $unc$one on the way
i s-
you sound busy
so youre teaching them completely
yes
yes
and i think its becoming more popular then it has been for a while i think
home schoolings always been around
but i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools
and a lot of it is discipline problems
yeah
a lot of it is
and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers
its really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things that theyve been raised in a day-care center
yeah
yeah
thats pretty sad because i dont know somethings got to change with the schools
thats what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway
i think its going to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else
when theyre young
yeah
the home is the base
its the basic unit
and thats where it all starts
and if we dont start making changes in the homes
and maybe part of that is educating parents better
yeah
and educating
changing peoples expectations
i know they do have some classes in high schools and things for kids to give them an idea of what family life is like and that kind of thing
but
the aids issue is a bit of a problem
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is the financial end
and how can a country stand to spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem
but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the knowledge or at least the rumor im not really sure if its true or not that were not spending as much per lets say afflicted person on cancer
theres some
take breast cancer for instance
it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting many more people than aids
and yet more people die of it
and yet the funding has already exceeded
aids has more money than breast cancer
than
thats interesting isnt it
yeah
if its true
ive always heard these things
ive never bothered to dig it out and make sure
but ive heard it on more than $unc$one documentary that they were complaining that whoevers sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and
its just $unc$one big $unc$p $unc$r campaign that
yeah
we think thats the worlds worst thing
so lets give money to aids
and yet weve had breast cancer problems for years
right
and its just
course $unc$one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesnt effect men its not going to get funded
and having thought about that for a while
what did you think about that idea
i thought that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing
but then i got to thinking the number $unc$one killer of men seems to be the prostate
and theres only $unc$one test that just recently got developed a antibody test for the antigen in the blood
and thats fairly recent
and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
theyve not really given it attention either
yeah
so its not really cured
yeah
its not that heavily funded either
and then that seems to be $unc$one of the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer
so i dont know
i guess theres just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to be it through different organizations $unc$march of $unc$dimes type telethons or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever illness they wish
right
its kind of hard to get an even keel on that
its really hard to say
theres a $unc$hundred $unc$thousand per year affected by this $unc$one
so lets give it this amount
and then this other ones only a tenth of that
so give it a tenth of that and just keep doling it out that way
or
im glad im not the one thats in charge of making those decisions
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because theyre all so serious
its not so serious i guess until it affects your family
and then all of a sudden its the most important thing
right
so i would hate to have that responsibility just personally
but then again we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address
i guess it frightens me to think of so many people with aids and with cancer
and many of those things if theyre not able to be insured then the countrys going to pay for it $unc$one way or the other whether its through prevention or treatment or just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves
right
it seems like $unc$one way or the other were going to end up paying for it
thats true
but
the other thought that i had
ive had several minutes to think about this after i
while i was finding people i could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it
so its kind of a unfair advantage as it were
but the other thing that i thought of on this is i wonder if there isnt enough money in our economy or in our system
it seems like theres so much that goes to things that dont really do a whole lot of good
yeah
theyre kind of nice
but we have such an affluent society that i wonder if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything
just change our p-
of course then we wouldnt have any room to put people
but thats
right
just change our priorities a little bit
yeah
you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
or you hear these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other
and then you have all the arts that are nice and aesthetic
but are they that enhancing for the masses
right
they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that
but had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
all right this is easy for me since i
and me too because i eat out a lot
yeah
i travel
i do about $unc$forty percent of my time on the road
so you eat all your meals out
i eat a lot of meals out
im also married
and my wife is an a $unc$one cook
but she enjoys eating out
so i have to share it with her
and actually its very easy for me because i make it a practice when i am out
i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here
sure
so i look for just about anything
and its a lot of fun
i dont have to really worry too much about price considerations because i
i was going to ask you could you go to nice places
and
sure
yeah
and its really great
i like different types of food
what are the memorable places youve eaten
okay you name it
lets see
youve got $unc$one down near $unc$addison
theres $unc$two restaurants that i particularly like that every time i get into $unc$texas or i get into $unc$atlanta $unc$georgia i make sure i go
and thats houstons
houstons
uh-huh
yep
okay
its a great place
its great
theres a restaurant right outside of $unc$reading $unc$pennsylvania its called alfredos that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people
uh-huh
but it is fantastic
theres a restaurant and i dont recall the name of it in $unc$panama $unc$city
of course not too many people want to rush back to the country $unc$panama
okay
because i was thinking
i grew up in $unc$panama $unc$city
no
this is the country $unc$panama all right
i get it
right
but i have gotten to quite a few
and i go to $unc$canada and get quite a few restaurants up there
and i know the locations
and i know the places
but lot of times i dont remember the names
id have to go back through some expense reports
uh-huh
but particularly down in your area im looking for some more restaurants
so i dont know whats down there the ones out in $unc$addison
do you like mexican
do you like mexican food
not particularly
oh
thats $unc$one of the few
which one were you going to recommend
theres so many places here
its just lots of good mexican restaurants here
uh-huh
but in the $unc$addison about everything that you could want in $unc$dallas is in the $unc$addison area anyway
right
now theres a new italian place $unc$sfuzi
okay
i have a
ive not been there but it has a great reputation as $unc$one of the best restaurants in $unc$dallas
and now theres $unc$one in $unc$addison
okay
let
im writing it down
its $unc$s $unc$f $unc$u $unc$z $unc$i
okay
and its in $unc$addison
and its a great place
also a great place that they have $unc$cajun food is $unc$copelands
ive been there
i really like $unc$copelands
okay
ive been there
$unc$one down there is i think its an old schoolhouse
the i know
no
i dont like that place
i like the food
but i dont care for the clowning around
yeah
when i went i thought the food was not good
really
ive had
$unc$magic $unc$time $unc$machine is the place youre thinking of
thats it
thats it
ive had excellent food there
when i went i thought
the people drove me crazy first of all
true
true
but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was
uh-huh
yeah
all right
thats great
no
italian is fine
i make it a habit of always going out to $unc$pasta oggis which is right down there in $unc$ad-
do you like $unc$southwestern
yeah
now theres a good place in $unc$addison too called $unc$blue $unc$mesa $unc$grill thats on $unc$belt $unc$line thats close to houstons as a matter of fact
all right
really
and its great
they have i think
sometimes ive been when i thought it wasnt as good
but i went there recently
and i thought this really is good
uh-huh
so thats a very good place to eat the $unc$blue $unc$mesa $unc$grill
good
and
this is great
this is going to give me some more places to go
a whole new dining experience
okay
fine
i guess our times about up
so
they havent beeped us have they
they dont always
i thought sometimes they say this is $unc$three minutes or whatever
yeah
theyve been doing that when the circuits are busy
okay
and other than that they leave you go about $unc$five minutes
and then thats about it
i guess thats what they need for their machines to get everything down pat
so
okay
it was a pleasure talking to you
thanks for calling for helping us out
okay
you bet
bye-bye
bye-bye
do you have any recycling programs there
i dont really think we have anything in the works as of yet
uh-huh
were a pretty small town
and the closest thing we have are bins out in front of $unc$wal-mart that show plastics paper liter bottles $unc$et $unc$cetera et $unc$cetera
uh-huh
yeah
weve progressed a little bit farther than that
yeah
actually they have
parts of town
it may have even spread all over the whole town
and they will have these green bins
uh-huh
and its just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump
yeah
and just along with a trash can you have this green plastic bin
and you put your bottles in it and paper and all those things aluminum
anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin
oh
and i guess you can al-
and a lot of the restaurants they just have places especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles
yeah
and i dont know
i guess theyre clear bottles
yeah
so a lot of people do have those separated
and of course they have the dumpsters the igloos
yeah
and they have those strategically placed around the city
oh
and theyre actually going to extend it i think $unc$one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
and
that would be good
yeah
things of that nature
so i guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes necessary
yeah
its not anywhere near that
we
as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans
yeah
but thats as far as we go
because i take them to a girl at work
and she goes and cashes them in because
i can do that for her
uh-huh
and i dont want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it
yeah
really
yeah
we dont have anything here in $unc$belton
its a pretty small little town
yeah
i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans
yeah
and
so thats about all that were doing here
theyre getting a little bit more on
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you cant because not a lot of people do really know what its for
uh-huh
yeah
theyre doing a real good job of separating it here
and of course there you have a specific place to put your paper
yeah
and they try to get you to go ahead and separate it
but they actually have the door to door pickup
and i think it started out to be just kind of a test a pilot project
uh-huh
and it went over so well that they just extended it
and its almost
i dont know if its done by a private company or not
it may be
but they just go around to each door and pick it up
wow thats excellent
yeah
thats good
lets see
and every year of course the phone books they tell everybody across the city to put all their phone books in the recycle bins
yeah
oh
because phone books are pretty
for a bigger city theyre pretty thick
yeah
they are
and sometimes you might have $unc$two or $unc$three
exactly
so thats a big savings right there in itself
yeah
ours just goes in the regular trash
yeah
it just theres not a whole lot
and there are some places that will set up for old newspapers and stuff
uh-huh
but usually it hasnt caught on yet
im hoping it will soon
uh-huh
the thing about newspapers and paper
recycled paper is actually very expensive
yeah
so when you see something thats on recycled paper theyve actually gone to a lot of expense to do that
its
theyre not coming out ahead at all
its really a cost
i wasnt totally aware of that
yeah
it sounds good to the public
but theres really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something
aluminum i dont know
they may be coming out ahead
but i know for a fact that the paper on that end theyre not
yeah
its just good to recycle
but its not to their advantage
yeah
and it costs less
i cant think of anything else
i cant either because were at a very beginning stages
okay
so
uh-huh
we look forward to it to get better
i hope you all come along a little farther in the future
yeah
me too
it was nice talking to you
you too
bye-bye
bye
supposed to talk about boats
have you got a boat
no
i dont
do you
no
i dont
ive had one for quite a few years
but ive not had one the last couple of years
really
but its something ive always enjoyed
do you like boating
yeah
i love them
yeah
but my children all have been grown for a few years
and we were using it less and less and less
so we decided to sell it
and
i heard thats the second happiest day of your life
whats that
the day you sell your boat
no
i loved having a boat
i loved having it
no
no
i just heard that
thats just a joke i guess
okay
first best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it
but id like to have one
yeah
i just dont know if id have the time to use it
yeah
guy just
he needs his weekends free to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
yeah
but no
i guess for the cost of them you dont really
its hard to get
i dont know
i felt like i got my moneys worth out of mine
i had bought it used and kept it i dont know $unc$ten years and got within $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars when i sold it of what id paid for it and had it all those years
uh-huh
so you take care of them they hold their value real well
really
so you couldnt complain about that
did you go fishing
no
no
it was a big boat big ski boat type thing
okay
i had a $unc$hundred $unc$sixty horse $unc$murcruiser in it
wow
inboard outboard
i did fish out of it occasionally
but im not too much of a fisherman
really
but i did enjoy owning a boat
yeah
i like to fish
would recommend it to anybody
and sailing ive never been sailing
have you been sailing
yeah
ive sailed some
i just like $unc$fourteen foot $unc$sunfish
uh-huh
nothing big
ive never tried
ive always thought i bet that would be more fun
but id want to be with a skilled sailor
yeah
really
but it
they offer classes out at $unc$ray $unc$hubbard
yeah
ive always thought id like to
ive never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it
yeah
and at this stage of the game im not that interested in it anymore
okay
we go out with friends on the
we go to the lake just about every weekend down at $unc$mount $unc$vernon
and parents next door neighbors have a big barge
okay
and we go out and take them out on their barge
theyre getting kind of old
and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often
so we get out on the water occasionally
thats nice
yeah
but its fun
i do enjoy the lake
but once the children were grown
and wed go down there
and id get the boat out on $unc$saturday
and wed go for a ride and enjoy it so much
its such a pretty lake down there
wed enjoy it so much
and id say im going to leave the boat out because well probably do this again tomorrow
it got to where tomorrow the boat was still sitting there
and we never did go out again
and id have to go load it up the next day
and
where is that
$unc$mount $unc$vernon
yeah
$unc$cypress $unc$springs
$unc$cypress $unc$creek $unc$springs
okay
thats south of here
yeah
its down at $unc$mount $unc$vernon
okay
its probably the prettiest lake in the state of $unc$texas
really
yeah
its just a $unc$hundred miles from here
what do you take i $unc$thirty-five
no
you go down yeah $unc$thirty
$unc$thirty
its east of here
okay
east of here
$unc$hundred miles due east of here
all right
and
yeah
we just moved down here a couple years ago
so
did you
where did you all move from
$unc$colorado $unc$springs
did you
yeah
how are you liking it
we love it up there
good
thats where i grew up
yeah
uh-huh
but we like it down here pretty good
i think youll like it better
but of course its hard when you dont have any family around
yeah
we got $unc$two kids that are under $unc$two
yeah
and its kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them
uh-huh
yes
its hard on your folks too
i know
theyre all yours
and your wifes folks still live in $unc$colorado
yeah
uh-huh
there are supposed to be some people moving down here from $unc$colorado $unc$springs for $unc$t $unc$i
really
yeah
supposed to be
yeah
thats right
do you work at $unc$t $unc$i
i dont
no
uh-huh
a friend of mines dad was a program manager up there
uh-huh
and he just moved down here to $unc$mc-
what do you
i guess its
hes working in $unc$mckinney
uh-huh
yeah
i dont either
my wife does
okay
but its a good company
but were supposed to be talking about boats
so back to boats
tell me the last time you went for a boat ride
actually i went canoeing down the $unc$brazos this weekend
my gosh thats boating
that had to have been fun
it was fun
it was fun
what are your hobbies
actually my hobbies now are t shirt making
im making t shirts and sweat shirts
in fact thats what i was doing when you called
that sounds interesting
what kinds of sweat shirts and t shirts do you make
right now im making $unc$christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing
okay
is that silk screening or
no
im have material that i cut out
and then you
theres this stuff called $unc$wonder $unc$under that you iron it on
and then you iron that on the t shirt and you paint around it
i see
so its real fun
i started doing it as just something fun to do
and now im selling them and pretty
hows it going
pretty good
i just started last week
and i sold $unc$seven
i wasnt expecting that
so
that sounds great
i guess in my spare time ill be making t shirts
so
somebody has to do it
thats right
give you a little $unc$christmas money any way
thats correct
what are your hobbies
i kind of have hobby fads i guess
uh-huh
when i was growing up i was into coin collecting
and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess
and then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
now my latest one is classic cars
i had a $unc$sixty-six $unc$mustang i was rebuilding
almost had it done
and i went ahead and sold it
my gosh
but it was fun
i really enjoyed it
howd you learn to do that to fix them up
you just
you just get a book that tells you how to do it or what
no
you just kind of
all i did is i bought the car
and then you can
i was just in a supermarket
and i seen a magazine for
basically it was called $unc$mustang $unc$magazine
and so i bought it
uh-huh
and they had some names some companies that sold mustang parts
and i just started ordering some parts
and basically what i did was i redid the whole interior
i didnt do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the whole interior and then part of the exterior
just kind of do it
whered you get the car
we lived in $unc$south $unc$dakota
and i bought it up there before i moved down here
wow
so it was kind of rusted out there
there isnt too much rust on any vehicles down here
thats true
thats true
that sounds neat
gee i guess there really isnt too much to talk about on hobbies
lets see
that about covers mine
and t shirt making about covers yours
lets see
ive done other hobbies
im a hobby person
ive always done a lot of craft stuff
i always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that
and i collect dolls
i have a huge collection of dolls which is still in $unc$new $unc$mexico with my parents
in $unc$new $unc$mexico
uh-huh
from $unc$new $unc$mexico
okay
lets see
what else
i started collecting music boxes
i guess thats a hobby
yeah
that is
thats interesting
how many music boxes do you have
probably about $unc$twenty
do they all play different songs
uh-huh
or do some of them play the same song
they all play different songs
thats neat
whats the most expensive $unc$one you bought
the most expensive
i dont know
ive gotten all of them for gifts
i dont
really
bought a few of them
i usually get them for $unc$christmas gifts and when people go on trips or something
thats interesting
it used to be tea spoons was the thing
thats true
i never collected those
thats interesting music boxes
i have dolls from all over too
that i started when i was a little girl
and i have a lot of dolls
people would always bring them when they go to the countries
and i did that when i went to $unc$europe one summer
i bought a doll everywhere we went
so
well how was $unc$europe
economy
it was great
it was quick
i was in high school
and i was in a tour
and we went all
its kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries
and it was called $unc$people to $unc$people
and wed stay in peoples homes
and then we got to also tour big cities
and i really enjoyed it
was that in high school
uh-huh
or was that a college thing
in was in high school
so id like to go back because we had
everything was rushed
i bet
everything was an hour or $unc$two hours at the $unc$louvre things like that where you need the whole day
but it really
right
thats where a camcorder would come in handy
exactly
thats true
that sounds real neat
so you havent been back to $unc$europe since then huh
no
i always thought i would
but who knows now
i got married and maybe some day
maybe its $unc$one of those retirement things
there you go
does you husband
what does he think of your t shirts and
he likes it all right
hes been pretty good because theres t shirt stuff all over the house
does he help out much
or
what kind of car would you like to buy next
i guess $unc$cadillac
i guess thats kind of everybodys dream
why would that be
i guess its a $unc$general $unc$motors product
and i like $unc$general $unc$motors because theyre made in the $unc$united $unc$states
and weve had $unc$general $unc$motors for years and have always had real good luck with them
okay
thats good
uh-huh
if you had no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
i think id still go with the $unc$cadillac
do you
i dont care about a big fancy
which type of $unc$cadillac is your favorite
i dont know
i guess the $unc$seville probably or
the $unc$seville
yeah
thats a sharp looking car
yeah
that really is
it always has been though
yeah
they have been
it doesnt have the $unc$coup $unc$de $unc$ville or the $unc$sedan $unc$de $unc$ville squareness
it never really has
its always had its own unique look
uh-huh
ive always liked that
i liked the
a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
yeah
right
i thought that looks sharp
yeah
that looks real sharp
i think the ones now with all of the fancy gold lettering and all i think theyre very pretty
uh-huh
and course what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty
yeah
and the
ive never ridden in one recently
but theyre supposed to be just real smooth
uh-huh
just a nice comfortable ride
yeah
they are
and theyre just always
they look like theyre sturdy
uh-huh
they look like theyre very sturdy
and you dont have to worry that much about getting hurt like you would in a small one
right
now theyve got a unique feature in them now
if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesnt go into the inside
itll go underneath the car instead
i didnt know that
so thats a big safety factor theyve got in them now
yeah
and i suppose they all have the balloons
the air bags
yeah
the air bags
yeah
thats great
thats great
yeah
yeah
you say youve always have preferred $unc$general $unc$motors products
yeah
i do
i go for things built in the $unc$united $unc$states rather than foreign countries
right
help our economy
and
what kind of $unc$general $unc$motors cars have you had in the past
mostly $unc$oldsmobiles
$unc$oldsmobiles
those are real nice riding cars too
yeah
thats what we have now
but of course if i have a choice id still have the $unc$cadillac
but ive been very satisfied with the $unc$oldsmobiles
weve driven them for about probably $unc$twenty years
has that been the $unc$cutlass or the $unc$sierra
no
the $unc$ninety-eight
the $unc$ninety-eight
okay
uh-huh
yeah
i dont think
lets see
the $unc$ninety-eight
thats got that big $unc$v $unc$eight engine in it doesnt it
i dont know
the one we have has a $unc$six
has a little $unc$v $unc$six
uh-huh
okay
but its a very good car
its not had $unc$one minutes problem with it
it
and now i have $unc$twenty-three $unc$thousand miles on it
thats great
yeah
thats great
thats always nice to get reliability in a product especially when youre spending anywhere from $unc$fifteen to $unc$twenty-five $unc$thousand dollars for a single item
right
you just dont want any hassles with it
no
you expect it to do its job
and i think a lot of car manufacturers dont take that into consideration
yeah
yeah
thats true
they just expect you to buy their product
but thats been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be
uh-huh
price is an issue
but its not the most important issue
no
it really isnt because now you can get $unc$five year financing on them
and so
right
but i would go with the $unc$general $unc$motors any time
ive always been a $unc$ford man myself
really
yes
but thats all right
yeah
sure
its $unc$american made too which is good
right
uh-huh
but ive
ever since i guess i was growing up my dads always had $unc$fords
and i grew up in $unc$south $unc$dakota
so everybody has a truck
uh-huh
and my $unc$ford trucks have just
ive just never had problems with them
uh-huh
i honestly think i would die before my truck would keel over on me
yeah
i
yeah
those are good products also
lets see
my t v down
okay
im sorry
invasions of privacy
uh-huh
what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things
uh-huh
all sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing
uh-huh
yes
i hate those canned messages they put on my recorder
my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen
just what went into the
something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers
uh-huh
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
uh-huh
but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using
and businesses would be prohibited from calling for business selling you things
i have through the phone company
im sure thats true
no $unc$nine $unc$hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received
some of did too
i think government can do that now
is that right
uh-huh
and especially with possibly children around
uh-huh
that could be useful protection
right
yes
and i dont have children around
but i just dont like those $unc$nine $unc$hundred numbers
so ive excluded those
so i used to deal with
but it does not stop you from the dialing services
what are dialing services
where they intend to sell you things
where people just call you
uh-huh
uh-huh
and leave again that canned message on the
and then those problems has been eliminated
those problems used to be when i used a credit card theyd want to have my phone number
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i did not like giving it out
i gave out my work number
right
but i think im not sure if its by law just
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number
thats the thing i hated too about $unc$radio $unc$shack
how did $unc$radio $unc$shack work
if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number
and i dont think theyre going to call me and ask me how its functioning
and i dont give that out
i have an unlisted number
so i dont
yes
thats $unc$one solution
but you nonetheless often get people calling you
sure
despite the fact that your number is unlisted
uh-huh
and you actually have your number
or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours
anything that you buy you may get put on a preferred list that is purchased
uh-huh
uh-huh
and companies can purchase this list
and what that is is people who buy from the mail
yeah
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers
uh-huh
ill be thinking in mind the address is
is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number
no
not really
no
some of that unfortunately is legal
so they cant stop people from advertising
and thats what it falls under
it falls under the guise of advertising
so i dont care for it
but is it a legal solution for some companies
so thats the way things are
yeah
i dont know
i think its gotten much worse the last few years
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe thats just because ive gotten on more lists
they
the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy
youve got the holy rollers
and youve got all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to either direct you to the right path or want to sell you paper routes whatever
so its not just the telephone
yeah
sell you magazines
uh-huh
i guess whatever is
i just dont give
for $unc$n $unc$i $unc$s $unc$t the $unc$national $unc$institute of $unc$standards and $unc$technology
okay
so its right up your alley then
i suppose so
let me push the button
all right
okay
i guess im supposed to be all for switching to the metric system
but i sense that its not going to happen anytime soon
yeah
i dont think its going to happen either
but i wish it were
because i got my bachelors in mechanical engineering
uh-huh
im at grad school now in acoustics
and all we do is metric stuff
youre now in what
acoustics
acoustics
yeah
so everythings metric
and then you go to read some order book or something
and its all confusing
so i dont understand as much
so i think we should get one adopted permanently
i guess that is the policy
but its been the policy for a long time
and nothing ever happens
i suppose some things happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that thats happening having a new generation come up thats more used to it
yeah
a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to
they have to for international trade
yeah
but i guess its easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming into everything
uh-huh
yeah
i dont think switching back and forth is that big a deal
i think people need to understand more what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms
because someone says a kilogram
no one knows what that is
everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind
yeah
i dont see that it can change it very quickly
were not the kind of society that something can be posed upon by government will
yeah
no one seems to be adopting it
metric system no one wants it at all seems like
the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems money dollar coins anything like that
yeah
and it obviously makes no sense that were practically alone in the world in using the old system
yeah
its pretty tough when you get everything confused though
i think $unc$two systems is worse than $unc$one though
because i know we do a lot of problems and things
and theyre half english and half metric
and you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems
just get one
i prefer metric
but even if its english they should just have $unc$one
unfortunate- i think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day
yeah
yeah
i think so
your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination
there are things you could do
we have signs up on the $unc$n $unc$i $unc$s $unc$t campus here speed limit $unc$twenty-five miles per hour $unc$forty kilometers per hour
yeah
but that hasnt been adopted very widely
yeah
they have some of those in $unc$ohio
theres this one signs kind of funny
it says metric signs next $unc$hundred miles
and no one will go a step further to remove the english signs
yeah
that would force everybody to use it or to quit selling tape measures in inches
yeah
or you have highway signs saying speed limit $unc$eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number
yeah
i guess a $unc$hundred is $unc$sixty-two
$unc$hundred car is going $unc$sixty-two
yeah
it would be more like $unc$ninety i guess
car is going $unc$fifty-five
you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now
yeah
you have a bunch of people trying to do $unc$ninety
do the schools emphasize the metric system
yeah
in the engineering they all do pretty much
no
down like in the elementary schools
in the elementary schools
i dont know
i wouldnt think so
i remember a ways back we did like conversions
i think
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on $unc$one system
yeah
i think my children learned the metric system
but it doesnt get emphasized over the other
yeah
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch
and thats about it
okay
were supposed to talk about vacations
right
what kind of vacations do you like
i havent been to many places
but i have a opportunity to go to $unc$paris $unc$france with my friend in $unc$april
her family lives there
and shes only been there once
her grandmother lives there
uh-huh
so im praying i get to go
thats great
yeah
it will be probably the most exciting place ill ever get to go
uh-huh
have you ever been to $unc$new $unc$mexico
no actually
oh
why have you
i was curious
i was just wondering what it was like
okay
no
i have been to $unc$europe once and to $unc$haiti and
$unc$tahiti
yeah
$unc$tahiti
oh
no
no
$unc$haiti
$unc$haiti
right
where is that
its in the $unc$caribbean
and its the western half of an island
with the eastern half thats the $unc$dominican $unc$republic
uh-huh
and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend $unc$three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries and study the language and then do a little service project
uh-huh
yeah
that turned out to be a really good experience for me
what did you do when you were in $unc$europe
i went there when i was in high school actually
uh-huh
and i mostly went to $unc$germany and visited some friends of my family and hung out with them worked a bit on $unc$one of their farms and also went to a youth camp
what did you do on the farm
not that much
just
are you just kind of
right
i wasnt a great asset to them or anything
but i drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
and yep
and i went to a youth camp that included working at an old peoples home
and that was pretty interesting
and while i was there i visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in $unc$france in $unc$nantes which is on the west coast right across from $unc$england
where in $unc$france are you
$unc$paris
right
$unc$paris
yeah
and how long do you plan to be going for
$unc$two weeks
last time she stayed $unc$two months
but were only going to stay $unc$two weeks
uh-huh
great
and
were going to take a cooking class there
so that might be fun
a what
cooking class
$unc$french cooking
great
yeah
and what else are you planning to do if anything
museums
go to museums and
uh-huh
yeah
do you go to museums in $unc$europe
actually no
i dont think i went to any of them
the closest thing i did was go to some restored castles and stuff
there is some on that west coast of $unc$france
and i went to a vineyard or $unc$two in $unc$germany
thats neat
yeah
that was nice
so
hey
what about
have you ever been to hawaii
no
i havent
no
have you
no
okay
im wanting to go there
where have you gone first
where have i gone thats anywhere
yeah
all right
short term i dont think anythings going to be done about it or probably should be done about it
right
are you saying you dont think anything should be done in the short term
the short term the recession is getting top attention
yeah
i think that youre absolutely right there
the other thing is is that weve got all these bank defaults going on and savings and loan defaults and
and that effectively adds to whether its officially on the books or not
right
exactly
and thats got to be paid
exactly
so this creates a pretty serious problem thats going to continue to be with us for a while to come
im not really sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if theyre talking about reducing the tax that needs to be paid or the tax thats currently being paid then it seems to me it cant possibly help with the deficit picture
it can only hurt the deficit picture
yeah
exactly
and the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without bringing on serious problems for the longer term
yeah
exactly
so thats the current predicament
yeah
it seems like its a kind of a $unc$catch $unc$twenty-two
its the
my understanding is what supposedly theyre trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes theyll have more money to spend
and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue
but it seems like its sort of an unending spiral
and it
im not sure that theres any real genuine truth to the idea that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the $unc$bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to result in substantial amounts of money for consumers to spend
and
yeah
im not sure how i feel about paying on the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point
its probably a judgment of how bad the recession is
yeah
it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do
first of all you look to the $unc$fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think thats been a positive development
i think what thats done is its help keep inflation from
at the moment were doing very well on inflation
yeah
exactly
thats the sort of upside to the deficit
its a sort of a piece of luck
thats the upside to the recession
yeah
i dont know
what kind of things do you think can be done in the long term
can be done or will be done are $unc$two different things
at various places to look for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation
sure
but there are various other areas such as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed
a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think they should put in
the $unc$reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class
uh-huh
in the longer term wed do well i think to make reductions there
also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed
right
i think that i agree with you certainly in the second situation
and i think certain entitlements im inclined to agree with you too
education happens to be $unc$one place where i think that we would foolish to
a lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges
uh-huh
but schools that teach you trades beautician often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition and the school gets paid off immediately
i see what youre saying
and then the people default on the loans
and then they dont provide very much education
yes
i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that around
and i cant confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing
but taking what youre saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely
yeah
okay
what kind of foods would you have
okay
i like to cook
i do too
but i dont like getting too awfully fancy about it just because its too much pressure
uh-huh
uh-huh
if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice and relaxed
yeah
you cant enjoy it
right
yeah
and so i dont like to arrive when they arrive for me to be completely worn out
thats what
i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven
yeah
its
exactly
everybody just says how wonderful it is
and its like yes
uh-huh
i
yeah
thats $unc$one of those things i got famous for in college
people would come and say would you come over and make lasagna for me
uh-huh
its like i cant really give you a recipe
uh-huh
youd just do it
i can just do it
i like doing that kind of stuff
yeah
and its fun
in fact thats what we had for a $unc$christmas party last week
uh-huh
we just had a bunch of people over
and we did lasagna and garlic bread and yummy
boy i like that
i do too in fact
yeah
im planning a
and naturally this is appropriate because im planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
oh
good
so $unc$tuesday night therell be $unc$eight people here altogether
actually $unc$one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because its real easy is just baked potato dinners
yeah
uh-huh
and have $unc$three or $unc$four couples come over
and ill do the potatoes and butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
uh-huh
and it turns out great because youve got hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and bacon and all that good stuff
yeah
thats fun
uh-huh
but its inexpensive
yeah
plus its real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it
and you got a great dinner
yeah
thats a good idea
its real easy
i like doing that part
yeah
im in favor of very little clean up very little planning because weve got $unc$three or $unc$four couples that we get together with to play games
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and we invariably end up at my house since ive got $unc$two kids
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its fine because then i can just say okay fine
you bring this
you bring this
you bring this
were done
yeah
and its pretty cool
yeah
thats good
$unc$one of my favorites if i dont want to have other people bring stuff i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice
uh-huh
oh
its very easy to
oh
you dont like it
i love it
you do
okay
yeah
i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
and you put the chicken in then pour the broth over
and you can put mushrooms in if you want
and then you just
over the uncooked rice
yeah
over uncooked rice
oh
and you can either microwave it
or do it in the oven
and it just
how neat
it fluffs up
and its really moist
ive done it where well i guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
uh-huh
wow
yeah
and every once in a while ill slice white grapes
and ill put in there
and thats just because im not a real big wine person
but i like it
it adds something to the chicken
uh-huh
yeah
and then just bake it
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
ill keep that $unc$one in mind
yeah
yeah
that was $unc$one of the first things i made for my husband because i was
yeah
yeah
i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of
uh-huh
yeah
you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner
yeah
or you know semi
but then i hadnt thought about doing it with uncooked rice
yeah
just in a $unc$thirteen by $unc$nine pan
yeah
you put in
lets see what was it $unc$three quarters of cup of rice
or
it depends on
you can really vary it
uh-huh
but you have to put the water in proportionally
i cant remember
i think it was $unc$three quarters cup rice to $unc$two cups water $unc$two cups broth
yeah
yeah
i use that for rice
and for when i cook pasta or something ill put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
yeah
flavor
uh-huh
yeah
that would be good
uh-huh
how long do you have to bake it
lets see
i think it was an hour
ive done it in the microwave so often lately because its really easy
i do microwave too a lot
yeah
but i think its about an hour
how long would it be in the microwave
or maybe its only half hour
you just
until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone before it gets overdone
okay
okay
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
yeah
or do you go ahead and let it cook through
id let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster
this is a beneficial call
i like this
yeah
i liked your idea too there
yeah
but that ones an easy one
its like just put in
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine
uh-huh
put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that however much effort you feel like putting into it
yeah
uh-huh
but it makes a great
ive got a $unc$two year old and a $unc$four year old
and they love it
uh-huh
because my daughter calls it her gravy
and she thinks its wonderful
my good youre a picky eater if i can get you to
did you watch the $unc$bulls this morning
you know what
i watched a little bit of the $unc$bulls game
and i had to leave
in fact i think the $unc$bulls were ahead when i left
who won the game
they won in a squeaker
they won by $unc$two points
is that right
they were behind as they headed into each quarter
and then they came back in the second half
and at the end i think they looked like they were closing it out
and then $unc$detroit kept coming back
and $unc$isaiah missed a $unc$three point attempt at the end
uh-huh
and i think the $unc$bulls won by $unc$two
i think they do as a matter of fact
yeah
$unc$one of the commentators said that they expected that the $unc$bulls would if they continued at their current pace set an $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a record for $unc$seventy wins in a season
wow
yeah
they looked real good
and
they do
and they
i think by relieving some of the pressure off of
$unc$michael $unc$jordan really helped them out
they dont have to rely on him to score $unc$thirty or $unc$forty points at every game
right
so
yeah
theyre balancing their attack
i know
im
yeah
i saw just a little bit of the highlights of the $unc$warriors $unc$dallas game
i saw the second half of the game last night
and they were impressive
they look good
$unc$billy $unc$owens looks like he was
that was a good move for the $unc$warriors to trade for him
yeah
i havent kept up with what was going on with the
they traded away $unc$mitch $unc$richmond
or is it $unc$tim $unc$hardaway
$unc$one of the $unc$two who along with $unc$chris $unc$mullen was
though $unc$three were $unc$three of the best in the $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a
and they made a heck of a threesome
uh-huh
and they traded either $unc$richmond or $unc$hardaway to $unc$sacramento for $unc$billy $unc$owens
and
good move
yeah
yeah
hes really worked out well
the $unc$warriors have got a team
and i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do
theyre ahead
and the $unc$lakers are down i guess in fourth position in the west
and i dont know
yeah
in the east i dont know
is it $unc$boston in first place
i think bostons in first
i havent kept up with any of the other teams
im so depressed with the $unc$dallas $unc$mavericks
boy
theyve had a hard time
they said theyve lost a lot of squeakers
man!
that
yeah
but just this whole year has been just disastrous for them
and i think theyre going for an all time record of how many losses in a row they can pull out
yeah
its unbelievable
how do people in $unc$texas deal with $unc$dallas $unc$houston and $unc$san $unc$antonio
do you for example like $unc$san $unc$antonio in $unc$dallas
actually the $unc$dallas area here pulls for $unc$dallas
$unc$san $unc$antonio pulls for $unc$san $unc$antonio
and $unc$houston pulls for the $unc$rockets
so there isnt much crossover
y-
there really
not a whole lot
you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams
yeah
i guess its kind of like there in the $unc$bay area you dont find a whole lot of $unc$sacramento fans
yeah
its true
because $unc$san $unc$antonio isnt that close to you are they
really isnt
uh-uh
no
its about the same distance from here to $unc$san $unc$antonio as it is from there to $unc$sacramento
is it
yeah
so its not something youd drive
so its not really a local
yeah
i was thinking maybe $unc$david $unc$robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
he does a lot of local stuff there in $unc$san $unc$antonio
and they have got a great club
theyve done a good job
of course drafting a franchise like him certainly
yeah
yeah
that always makes a big difference
yeah
thats
i think thats the way it works now in basketball
$unc$magic was a franchise for the $unc$lakers and $unc$bird for the $unc$celtics
yeah
and
and i used to think that $unc$one player really doesnt make a club
but it really does
it
you get somebody like $unc$magic
and you can see the decline in that team
yeah
once he left its not the same team
theres not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for
i think youre right
and i think $unc$isaiah $unc$thomas would fit in $unc$detroit
and i think those things do make a difference
and there are marquee players
and i think $unc$jordan and the $unc$bulls have to be considered the likely favorites
yeah
i dont know who would meet them in the west
i dont know how good $unc$portland will turn out to be by the end of the year
they were so disap-
who won that $unc$portland game
i watched only a few minutes of it
and i wasnt paying attention
and so i dont know
but $unc$phoenix and $unc$portland have both been very good clubs
and
i guess were forced finally to do a lot about air pollution
i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars
and low polluting fuels are being experimented with $unc$ethanol and other types of fuels
yeah
$unc$one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from or sources
i assume that the major sources are cars and factories
thats what i would think
but i dont know for sure
i just know that acid rain apparently is a big problem in $unc$canada from comes over the border from us
right
yeah
i think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns
and then i dont know about chemical pollution
im not real into that as far as how it affects the air
i know we have a lot of the indoor type pollution
they have offices that are too well insulated
they found people are getting sick
yeah
but i dont know if that affects outside
i think seems to me thats what they were asking about was outside
and the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
yeah
the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes
yeah
i guess theres been a lot of pressure to do away with the $unc$c $unc$f cs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
right
yeah
thats destroying the ozone isnt it
again thats what i hear
and theres this big debate apparently about whether theres a hole in the ozone or not
but at last i heard it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
yeah
thats wh-
its kind of scary
it is scary
and i think it will continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
yeah
weve got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
i think something too that you probably see in older states we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
im wondering whether its going to get to the point where you cant do that
i think it will
in $unc$los $unc$angeles theyre apparently going to
theyve passed laws that for habit for example people using barbecues gasoline lawn mowers
uh-huh
and its really bad in places like $unc$los $unc$angeles
and its gotten bad in $unc$denver
right
and its not too bad around here although you see it more and more in the sky
and people in this country are really wedded to their cars
right
and our economy seems to
and this i think is $unc$one of the big problems
yeah
in this area too since in $unc$texas were so spread out
yeah
we have to drive so far
but i know in $unc$colorado i have witnessed that where it just stacks up when the $unc$rockies starts
but were even getting it here
we can when weve been on vacation or something drive into $unc$fort $unc$worth or $unc$dallas
and you can tell it in the mornings too
my husband likes to go out and jog
and theres just a brown fog here
and we dont even have any mountains that are holding it in
yeah
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
that makes a lot of sense
i hadnt thought about it that way
but it
you dont have to have mountains that are stopping it
yeah
and they making more and more high-rise buildings
so yeah
we can comment
and we didnt see this a few years ago
no
and i think
it was pretty clear here
yeah
and i think that more and more its becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything thats going on it is an organism of sorts and that there is a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy $unc$one part of it its going to tell us about it
right
and were going to feel it
and i think its going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars
uh-huh
yeah
and in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable
for example taxing people heavily for using their cars
yeah
and i have a little sports car that i enjoy using
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
but i think were going to have to make some fundamental changes
and im not sure how long its going to take or what its going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell
yeah
and its a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just $unc$one person in that
its a lot of waste
but
okay
the topic is to discuss the sources where i receive news
uh-huh
and for me thats mostly newspaper and radio
i almost never watch television as a matter of course
so i dont get news from television
except during the war i watched a lot of $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n because it was so good
uh-huh
why was $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n the only
of course i think $unc$saddam $unc$hussein only allowed $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n to broadcast it
is that not true
it was unusual not to have the different sources of news coverage
yeah
i dont know
i guess i dont even know why i watched $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
i guess i just wanted more news
its $unc$one of the few times i wanted more news than
yeah
i know even if you watched $unc$a $unc$b $unc$c $unc$n $unc$b $unc$c or the other
whats the other one $unc$c $unc$b $unc$s
$unc$c $unc$b $unc$s
they all were tapped into $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
were they
uh-uh
yeah
thats the only thing they broadcast
and like you i listened to radio on my job at work
uh-huh
and all this week they have been having a discussion about that is why $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n was
i listen to a $unc$christian radio station
uh-huh
and they were saying that $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n is definitely a world news service
and they
it was
you cant really be sure of the quality of what youve got
we had some people from our church went to $unc$israel just for a tour sort of thing
uh-huh
and i was watching on tv
they broadcast this terrible riot
supposedly that was going on in $unc$jerusalem
right
and so it really made me question as to how do we know if the news were getting is any good
so
yeah
i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably dont affect $unc$ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
yeah
right
right
but im from $unc$california
and i can remember being in these earthquakes
and they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed from anyone elses point of view
yeah
but they get all blown up in the news
uh-huh
i find it depressing to watch our
specially tv
its just
local news concentrates on murders and things like that
im from $unc$dallas
and we have a lot of bad stuff
it just really gets me depressed even to watch it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
so then you wake up $unc$one morning
and you are in war with somebody
you dont even know about it
right
what newspapers do you read in $unc$dallas
we have the $unc$dallas $unc$times $unc$herald and the $unc$dallas $unc$morning $unc$news
but i dont read newspapers
dont you
huh-uh
how come
uh-huh
i find it hard to follow from $unc$one page to another
its just something i have never developed an interest in
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered its stolen before i can get out and get it
gosh that sounds pretty bad to me
who would steal a newspaper
you would be surprised
they just come by and pick them up even if its just for the tv selections of the day
i see
i dont know
it just wouldnt be there whenever i tried it
yeah
youre right
who would steal a newspaper
but they do
yeah
what part of $unc$california are you from
from $unc$los $unc$angeles
but i live in $unc$raleigh $unc$north $unc$carolina right now
thats where i am speaking to you from
okay
but i grew up in $unc$l $unc$a
i work out here
you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
i dont
i work for $unc$north $unc$carolina $unc$state $unc$university
but i know some people at $unc$t $unc$i
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
yeah
im in the computer business
i
boy current events is not a good subject for me
i dont keep up with it that often
lets see ive never done this before
ive never
this is your first call
this is my first call because i just got my password
really
yeah
so i dont know
are we suppose to
it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for $unc$three minutes
but i think weve been talking for $unc$three minutes
and nobody has interrupted
yeah
i got into a conversation last night with a lady
and they interrupt at $unc$ten minutes
i see
so if weve done our $unc$three minutes lets just let the conversation end and say bye
uh-huh
all right
nice talking to you
nice talking to you too
all right
bye
bye-bye
you want to start
i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it gives me a perspective on that
uh-huh
yeah
i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place
theres no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated from college the impression was that a womans career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
i think the change that ive seen as much as anything is one where couples are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
uh-huh
and i guess thats a significant change that ive both participated in and noticed
i agree
the equality of the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with the $unc$vietnam war
and you see women going off to wars as well as men
uh-huh
i have wondered why they allowed or let both the father and mother go
and the children are left without either parent
to me thats kind of a drawback
but i guess its a price you pay
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the day care centers
wonder about them in what way
from what i understand theres been studies that these children are more rebellious
they term it as more creative but that they are much more contentious
uh-huh
so i guess well have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up in kind of a community rather than a home
uh-huh
i have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation
yeah
i guess one knows ones own storly
and i know in my childrens case it was $unc$one where pretty much up until the older of $unc$two was lets see i guess basically starting junior high
and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
uh-huh
so they
so i guess my experience is just with what we did
and so they didnt really go through the child care route
yeah
they were able to be home together
and we never actually experienced that
in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so i guess i anticipate an increasing equality greater presence of women in management roles
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see
i just dont know
what do you mean
deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
yeah
sort of rent-a-mom
not to be crass about it but whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother person for instance that
yeah
thats strange
a nanny sort of
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting story or whatever
yeah
i dont think i have a philosophical problem with that
in fact i think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession
thats right
thats right
i dont have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent
i dont know that i felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
uh-huh
i dont have boys
that didnt bother me
never has
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or as a professional nanny as you put it
yeah
maybe well see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of say taking care of $unc$five or $unc$six children as opposed to day care
uh-huh
uh-huh
it would be a sort of day care
but it would be more of a family setting
right
i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so by definition that means theyre young in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman $unc$eight or $unc$nine or $unc$ten $unc$thousand dollars a year to take care of their child
uh-huh
uh-huh
to come in and live with them
i could easily envision that
pardon
to come in and live with them
or to put their child into a home setting where they would leave at $unc$eight in the morning and drop a $unc$two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be $unc$four other kids
uh-huh
and you were paying for really high quality care
yeah
right
i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on the order of what i quoted to someone because thats the experience they want
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity thats a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
uh-huh
and then you might have more control over the morals that they would be taught rather than in a classroom or a day care center
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
theyre
i havent ever really looked at them
are you aware at all of what they cost
no
i know several single mothers who absolutely cant afford it
they have to go with a baby-sitter more or less
uh-huh
but i think its about $unc$sixty dollars a week for $unc$two children if im not mistaken
uh-huh
and you have to pay that whether youre on vacation and taking care of the children or if the children are at home sick
uh-huh
that is just a rate that you have to pay
and
what do you envision for the next $unc$twenty years as far as women in american society
i think i really dont have a vision
thats okay too
yeah
i think that they will be more in the work place because the doors open
uh-huh
and its just human nature to walk through an open door
and i would be glad to see that
i hope i dont see a lot more single moms
but it seems in my experience im running across single women all the time
im noticing that too
and i notice a terming emerging called solo parents that im very aware of the number of solo mothers that i encounter in the work place
yeah
and that is a little troublesome because the pressures on them are rather formidable
yeah
yeah
its awful
yeah
and maybe thats a change well see
maybe the possibility of women who deliberately say no
well let the man take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
uh-huh
right
i think weve done it
i think were about done
okay
thank you very much
good-bye
its been interesting
you take care
okay
bye
bye
okay
are you a freshwater or
mostly freshwater
i
freshwater
yeah
i used to fish when i was real young down in $unc$galveston with my parents
and i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything
and i didnt know anybody who had a boat
so i dont fish too much in saltwater
uh-huh
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish
really
neat
and i have caught $unc$one or $unc$two small sharks
really
and yes
whatd you do with them
put them back
you didnt get a big kick out of killing them like some people do
no
no
no
i love shark steak
but the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything
do they have a limit on sharks
is that like a sport fish
can you actually catch those
and theres no limit
is there a limit
i have no idea
i know i
my home is in $unc$pensacola $unc$florida
uh-huh
so they do a lot of shark fishing in the gulf
right
and theres a certain period of time during the year all along the gulf coast i guess from $unc$galveston to $unc$mayport they have shark tournaments
and theres part either as part of or separate from the bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done much lake fishing for bass and so forth but maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing
right
really
right
uh-huh
i think ive been trout fishing once
ive never fly fished
have you fly fished
no
i havent
i dont know that i could do that
that looks awful tiring
ive tried it once
did you
yes
a friend of mine
didnt like it
no
i could never get the hang of it
it looks complicated to me
its a rhythm or something
uh-huh
i usually ended snagging my fishing partners or the trees along the bank
catching tree bass
right
yes
almost got an owl once
did you
that would have been something
but
do you fish mainly for trophies
or do you eat what you fish
no
no
no
no
when i was working in $unc$florida i used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation
uh-huh
right
there are people who fish
and then there are people who catch
right
im a fisher
you just like to sit down and watch it right
thats right
ive never caught that much
and occasionally wed go out on a full day trip $unc$three or $unc$four other people and do either again bottom fishing or for grouper
really
right
right
or ive caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
thats nice
what about you a
most of my fishing is done at area lakes around here freshwater lakes
uh-huh
and most of it
i havent been really in a long time
last time i went i actually was in $unc$galveston trying to saltwater fish
and it just wasnt working with my freshwater tackle
that was real fun
but i went fishing at i dont know if youve ever heard of $unc$lake $unc$worth
its a fairly new lake in $unc$texas
yes
and we went fishing there last memorial day
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep
i was so excited
and thats really about it
mostly just the lakes around here
and i fish to take home and cook
i dont get too much joy out of just sitting and watching
i get a little bit of relaxation from it
but mainly i want to say i brought something home
i want to say i did this
i was out there for a reason
the last time i went bass fishing
i was with my daughter a friend of hers and a friend of mine and his daughter
i was the only $unc$one who did not catch a single fish
really
my daughter caught fish
his daughter caught fish
he caught fish
everybody but you
i did not even
i was out on a party boat a few years ago
and we were grouper fishing
or actually we were snapper fishing
everyone on the boat was catching snappers except guess who
it had to be you
i
couldnt catch $unc$one to save your life
thats right
i would go from $unc$one side of the boat to the other
and the party boat captain could not understand
even he started baiting my hook and holding the fishing rod
how funny
just hoping maybe he could pull
right
and it was really really really bad
as i said i am a fisher
im not a catcher
right
but i enjoy it though
i dont really get out as much as i would like too
yeah
and they do of course
here in
were $unc$forty $unc$five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in $unc$maryland
right
and they do a lot of fishing there
of course what i used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or for oysters
yeah
that would be fun
and that i was able to do when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom
right
hand picked
that right
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught
we were in $unc$rockport which is close to $unc$corpus
uh-huh
and we had been fishing in a canal
they had all these canals up through this $unc$one little retirement area
and wed been fishing in the canals
and all we were catching were catfish
and we were pretty bored with that
so we thought maybe there are some crab in here
well try to catch some crab
so i got my chicken and all my little net and everything
and something
i had a rock to weight it down
something grabs and just runs with it
and of course theres no hook
so it cant be a fish
uh-huh
im sure its not a fish
right
and crab they dont bite like that
they dont just run with your food
so i netted it
and it was the ugliest fish ive ever seen in my life
it had real teeth like human teeth
and it looked archaic
i had no idea what it was
i called my father long distance just to describe the thing
and it had the rock in its mouth not the chicken
but the rock itself is what it had grabbed
they say its a dog fish from everything ive described
it was brown with these little white dots
uh-huh
and it made a loud almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
uh-huh
it was the strangest thing
ill never get over that
to this day i dont want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because im sure $unc$one of those fish are there
we used to
i guess the weirdest thing ive ever caught is in some of the inlets and the rivers around $unc$delaware
uh-huh
they have a fish thats called an oyster cracker
i dont know if youve ever heard of it
ive never heard of that $unc$one
and it has a huge strong mouth
and they actually use their teeth to open oysters
thats where it gets its name obviously
uh-huh
and this is the ugliest fish i have ever seen
and they come in all si-
ive caught them from $unc$three or $unc$four inches long up to
uh-huh
i guess the largest one i ever caught was probably $unc$eight or $unc$ten inches long
but just huge ugly things just terrible
can you eat them
no
no
ooh
i dont think id want to even if you could if theyre that ugly
but
they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them
thats like this dog fish
it scared me to death
uh-huh
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
the first time i went surf fishing was in
and i threw my line out
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or $unc$two feet long
and scared me to death
oh
i had never seen anything
and then i fished for another half hour or $unc$forty-five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth
and then i felt something relatively heavy
and i thought here im really going to get $unc$one
and i
okay
lets see
how do you feel about credit cards
personally i do not care for them although i find them a necessity in business and so forth
i try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons $unc$one of which is the extreme interest rate on most of them
uh-huh
the one i use of course mostly only for business purposes is $unc$american $unc$express
right
and im not terribly in favor of them
not for my own personal point of view
right
plus from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of $unc$five to $unc$ten $unc$billion i believe
yeah
right
wow
at least thats $unc$one number for this range of numbers i have heard
right
do you use them frequently
or
me and my wife when we have extra money that we know were going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah well use it
but last year i think we paid
i think it was like $unc$twenty something cents interest on our $unc$visa
uh-huh
and this year i think we used it for $unc$christmas
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period
so well pay a little interest this year but maybe $unc$two dollars
but we dont like to do that at all
yes
and i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly
we have several credit cards though
we have a gas card our $unc$visa and then of course the $unc$american $unc$express
and i think we have a couple of department stores
uh-huh
but we use it the same way
and
i find the $unc$one i use mostly
aside from the $unc$american $unc$express i do use my $unc$sears card
uh-huh
but as with the $unc$american $unc$express i try to pay it as it comes in
right
right
its not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill
thats usually how we do it
i know when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my $unc$american $unc$express card is before i left i would mail a check to $unc$american $unc$express and have some idea of how much was there id sent them several $unc$hundred dollars or whatever i felt i would spend and then use it then
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but for hotels and so forth
but i knew that it was paid
i knew that i had that much credit going in
right
yeah
sometimes i would go over
but it wouldnt hit me in a big way because i knew that i would have it covered in that respect
right
right
thats good
i dont think weve gone that far to pay it in advance before we spend it
but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it like that that may be good
i found in traveling overseas that often it would expedite things to have an $unc$american $unc$express credit card for hotel bills and so forth
uh-huh
oh really
yeah
plus when they would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
right
right
so now the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
uh-huh
for example i remember on $unc$one trip to $unc$france when i started planning the trip i think a dollar was worth $unc$nine or $unc$ten
uh-huh
and when i finally got over there it had fallen $unc$two or $unc$three francs to the dollar
so the
wow
so i got caught a little short in that regard
wow
but i was anticipating my room would cost lets say
yeah
if it were say $unc$sixty or $unc$seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about $unc$ten dollars or so or maybe $unc$twenty dolls-
right
maybe it would be more than that
it was more than
it would average out to $unc$thirty-five or $unc$forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate
right
right
but then when i got back and i was working for the government at the time
uh-huh
of course the government was several months behind on its $unc$per $unc$diem for exchange rate
right
yeah
right
so theres a little consternation in trying to get them to compensate for the difference in the exchange rate
yeah
right
yeah
especially
that was the only time i really got caught short
but as i said most of all i try not to use them lavishly in that regard
yeah
yeah
thats good
from where are you calling
from the $unc$dallas area
youre from $unc$dal-
okay
im from $unc$maryland
really
yeah
wow
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
i work for $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e
really
yes
i wonder how $unc$t $unc$i got $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e involved
i know $unc$jack $unc$godfrey
okay
i know him very well
ive known $unc$jack for a long time
and im also in the speech business
okay
so when i heard that $unc$jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this
yeah
yeah
and so thats how i got involved
yeah
you have a very
whats the word
your speech is very exact
thank you very much
but as $unc$jack said im $unc$one of the old hands in the speech business
really
yeah
yes
ive been doing it for $unc$twenty some odd years
wow
and so i was very much interested in getting involved in switchboard
yeah
so you work for $unc$t $unc$i
right
i work in
really
yeah
i guess were supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording
yeah
i think we talked for a good $unc$eight minutes about the subject
so i think you get $unc$ten
so i think were okay
alright
okay
fine
you have a good evening
you too
its been pleasant talking to you
same here
take care
good night
bye
what would you have at a dinner party
lately since i have children ive cut down on having dinner parties
uh-huh
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time
i have $unc$one recipe for a really good type of a meatball
its called burgundy meatball
and its made with red wine and
gosh that sounds great
its really good
and you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when youre ready to serve it
uh-huh
thats $unc$one of my favorite things to serve
i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party
sure
but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
really
i guess being from that part of the country
because crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish
but i wouldnt have to worry about satisfying my guest
uh-huh
but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like
shrimp fettucini is real easy to make and everything
yeah
and its usually well liked by people i guess
im just a seafood fan
so i think on the lines of
how do you cook crawfish
in fact i just came back from the grocery store
and being in $unc$texas we dont have too many people that eat crawfish
but they had live crawfish on sale
yeah
youre not supposed to eat them dead
you eat them dead
uh-huh
but
dont buy them that way
right
because if they are dead for too long
you can always tell whenever theyre cooked if theyve been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out
uh-huh
and youre not supposed to eat those because theyre bad for you
okay
ill remember that
yeah
so if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish
every once in a while youll see on-
it doesnt happen very often because its just an accident
but if the tail is straight on it then yeah dont eat it
uh-huh
but you just put lots of pepper
uh-huh
and you just boil them
and theyre absolutely wonderful
but theyre a pain to peel for some people
once you get used to it theyre real easy
but if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot
when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too
i think for a dinner party
i dont know
it depends
um-hum
like my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no they would shell their own
sure
wed just have crawfish and beer or something
but if it was more formal like if i was working environment then i would probably shell em or at least disconnect them from the head
but theres a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head
still have see that ooh
so it would just depend
thats the best part of the crawfish
sucking the head
but i dont know
it just depends on what type it was i guess
but you can buy the crawfish shells already peeled n everything
and usually you use those for frying or to put in salads or to make a sauce with or something like that
um-hum
but you can go ahead and buy em cooked and shelled
and theyre more expensive of course
but
does it taste a lot like shrimp
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
just the crawfish it just has a taste of its own
it also depends on whos cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
sure
but i think that
and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors $unc$doeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
yeah
we have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time
and
thats what i need
yeah
thats what i wish i had
but in our family i am the one who cooks
and i really enjoy it
its gotten a little more difficult with kids
but i really do enjoy cooking
and we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot
uh-huh
and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and id try to outdo him and then hed try to outdo me
oh!
and we
was really a lot of fun
i bet
and
that got pretty competitive as far as who could come up with the best recipe
yeah
it did
we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other
that would be fun
or
it was a lot of fun
it something unique
and then we got into different themes whether it would be ethnic food or sometimes it would be oh oh i dont know maybe an outdoor theme or elegant theme or
huh
it was a lot of fun
sometimes it might be the candlelight
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something
thats right
thats fun
it was fun
and we threatened to make the other $unc$two make us dinner one time just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying
uh huh
that sounds right id take him up on that
im
it does
except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just to make sure that they didnt have to do it again
uh huh
id be
make hot dogs or some potato chips
thats about how much i can cook
im doing a lot more cooking now than i used to
uh-huh
but thats only because my mom just started working
so shes tired when she comes home in the afternoon
so i try to have things cooked for her
but i usually try to stay out of kitchen
thats nice
i dont know
not $unc$one of my favorite hobbies
it can be fun if you have the time
but a lot of times its too much of a rush really be able to
my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every $unc$christmas and $unc$easter
whenever we have the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
and it has
i dont know
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs
and they are absolutely delicious
uh-huh
i dont know what she calls them in
im sure she puts wine in it because she cooks everything with alcohol
but
i dont know
i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
yeah
its in the other room
i dont know if we have enough time for it
oh
its real easy
$unc$one of the unique things in this its like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs an egg whatever seasonings
you can just light
yeah
so salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different
oh
that would be wonderful
makes them a little bit crunchy
you need to chop em up real fine
yeah
but it makes them crunchy
and that adds something new to it
and then the sauce is just made with bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and cornstarch instead of flour
um-hum
oh
so its not a thick rich type of a sauce
its more of a
when you use corn starch in gravy like when you have chinese food
um-hum
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency
how long do you cook the meatballs
the meatballs after you form them fry them in a pan until theyre browned on all sides
uh huh
and then drain off all the grease
then what i usually do is i freeze them
and then when youre ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it
oh
yeah
probably you have to heat it up for a good
if theyre frozen it may take a half for them to thaw out
but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself
let them simmer in the sauce itself
and its real good
that sounds great
especially the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance
right
if you are having a dinner party on $unc$wednesday night you could do it on a weekend
and then freeze them
sure
that would be great
i think im going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties cause i like to
im sure that ill be involved in a big company
and i know that my future husband will be
hes going to be working for $unc$chevron in $unc$houston
uh-huh
so hes going to be
im sure that dinner parties will come in handy
yeah
youll meet friends
invite the boss over and friends at work
yeah
i have to impress the boss and clients cause im in public relations in school
uh-huh
so my whole jobs going to be based on my clients n stuff like that
so im going to have lots of dinner parties
sure
and have to take em out to eat
right now im taking a class on ettiquesy
and all the little bitty things that i didnt even know
oh
really
mean i thought for sure id been raised properly
but ive been doing a lot of things wrong i didnt know about
so is there anything else
i think weve covered the subject
i got some interesting information about crawfish
i was in fact
its good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale
oh
yes
you need to try em
theyre wonderful
i will
im sure my husband will be surprised cause we were talking about them the other day before
okay
what basketball teams are you interested in
i guess im a big $unc$l $unc$a $unc$laker fan when it comes to pros
uh-huh
the college ranks i guess i really
of course i try to follow my $unc$alma $unc$mater
thats $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u in $unc$utah
uh-huh
but they dont have much of a team usually
no
theyre more of a football team than they are basketball team
yeah
yeah
you see them in football on t v once in awhile
yeah
you never see them on nationally basketball
thats true
i dont think ive ever seen them nationally on basketball
last year they had a really good team
the year that $unc$danny $unc$aines was there
uh-huh
that was about $unc$five $unc$six years ago by now
so they made it to the sweet $unc$sixteen once or twice in their history
thats not too bad
and thats
and they usually lose in the first round
uh-huh
how about you
im originally from the $unc$saint $unc$louis area
so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is $unc$chicago
so i do pull for $unc$chicago
uh-huh
of course this year is a good year to be a $unc$chicago fan i guess because theyre doing pretty good
is it the $unc$bulls youre talking about
yeah
yeah
yeah
the pro
as far as college teams i know its really easy to say
but ive been pulling for duke for about $unc$four years now
so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although ive really
is that right
again being from $unc$saint $unc$louis i pull for $unc$missouri
uh-huh
but theyre on probation this year
so you cant do much about that
no
no
but
did you watch the final $unc$four this year
yeah
i watched all $unc$three games of that
every game
and i was very pleased with all $unc$three games because $unc$kansas
i was pulling for $unc$kansas on the other side
so it was real nice to have the teams that were there
right
right
of course i wasnt really
i
$unc$u $unc$n $unc$l $unc$v kind of gave me the impression of being oh i dont know a macho team
they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
and maybe they were
but i was real happy to see them get knocked off
so
yeah
i watched that game
uh-huh
and it was a good game
yeah
it was a very close game and hard fought game
and it just
i dont know
it looked like $unc$u $unc$n $unc$l $unc$v may have had more talent
yeah
but as far as playing together as a team that day $unc$duke seemed to have them off balance
uh-huh
and that they couldnt
arent they more of a running gun team
$unc$u $unc$n $unc$l $unc$v
yeah
they play the pro style is what ive always called it
right
and
yeah
fast breaks and things and
yeah
the fast breaks and
they shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed
and
right
and $unc$u $unc$n $unc$l $unc$v wasnt used to that
of course i knew whenever $unc$u $unc$n $unc$l $unc$v went in at half time
i dont know if they were necessarily behind
but they werent ahead as much as they normally are
right
and that meant that they had to play a second half
and theyve not had to do that all year
and
right
right
they didnt have to go through some tough games during the year
so thats a terrible time to have to deal with that when it counts so much
thats right
dukes schedule was so much harder than $unc$u $unc$n $unc$l vs that it just made them a much tougher team overall
right
and that had to help them a lot
i think that probably was the difference in that game
uh-huh
because it really could have gone either way down to the end
do i take it that you think though that the $unc$lakers will win
or
i dont know
probably not
portlands pretty good
since kareems retired they havent had a center
yeah
and theyve got $unc$perkins
yeah
but i dont think hes really been a super star for them
no
hes
i dont
i
he to me is not a center
hes more of a real tall forward
yeah
right
right
i think $unc$magic does a
theyll make it
its going to be a war between $unc$chicago and $unc$boston $unc$celtics
yeah
thats going to be a war
that sure is
it
its going to be a great series
i think thats going to be $unc$one of those thats won by the home team
yeah
whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think
$unc$one of those $unc$two will probably be in there
let me see
where does $unc$detroit fit in
detroits in that same division
uh-huh
so i dont know
those $unc$three
$unc$detroit hasnt been having that great a year this year
no
but as i heard $unc$isaiah came back this week
uh-huh
so that might help them
yeah
they have the play-off experience
but
yeah
do- all $unc$three of them do with $unc$larry $unc$bird back
yeah
you can never count the $unc$celtics out when $unc$larry birds starting to click on all cylinders
thats true
uh-huh
they say hes starting to play
yeah but hes been kind of up and down all year
right
$unc$one game and hell be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
and then the next time he cant seem to hit the side of a barn
right
so i dont know
right
im not sure about him this year
last ive heard is that hes starting to peak right now
uh-huh
thats when you do it
hes starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year
yeah
any dark horses i
the dark horses
$unc$san $unc$antonio is the dark horse that could really flip in there i think
yeah
thats
yeah
anybody who has $unc$david $unc$robinson has got to have a chance anyway
yeah
hes got to be pretty much
i use to say $unc$akimo $unc$lija was the dominant player when he
uh-huh
against any team he would dominate
but robinsons getting up there where every game hes just
thats right
it looks like hes going in for a dunk
and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back
uh-huh
nobodys got enough beef i guess to challenge him when hes driving hard to the hoop
hes
too bad the $unc$mavericks couldnt get him
thats true
with $unc$roy $unc$tarpley theyre in big trouble
yeah
then hes gone now
so they dont have to worry about that
yeah
for awhile anyway
i thought he was gone period
i didnt read the story
but i read that
i heard he was suspended because of his
that might have been what it was
but i guess the headlines said something about him that the $unc$mavericks released him or something
maybe i misunderstood what they meant
if they did theyd still have to pay his contract
yeah
they may have done it
you never know
it was a lot of money
he was making
yeah
but
i heard on the radio it was $unc$sixty-three $unc$thousand and change a month
thats what he was being paid
he wasnt even playing
yeah
boy what a good job he had
thats what i think
he ruined his sweet position
yeah
yeah
im looking forward to the pro play-off
yeah
its coming up isnt it
$unc$l $unc$a
yeah
$unc$san $unc$antonio
whos the other one thats doing so well this year
is that $unc$portland
$unc$portland
yeah
$unc$portland
$unc$portland
i havent seen them on much $unc$t $unc$v that much at all
but all i can do is hear about
boy they have the seeing eye
uh-huh
what do they have
$unc$walter $unc$davis and
theyve got the $unc$two $unc$johnson brothers
or theyre not brothers
but i mean theres $unc$two guys named $unc$johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something
i forget how that works
but like i said theyre doing extremely good right now
$unc$phoenix isnt doing too bad
so it ought to be a real interesting play-off
right
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
i dont think theres any clear pick
uh-huh
i guess the $unc$two teams that you cant count out are the $unc$celtics because of $unc$bird and the $unc$lakers because of $unc$magic $unc$johnson
uh-huh
they are $unc$two guys that seem to find a way when they
when its on the line
when its on the line they seem to find a way
uh-huh
so those are what makes a champion i guess
yeah
thats true
yeah
its been nice talking to you
nice talking to you
all right
take care
take care
bye
okay
okay
when you baby-sit what age group children do you sit with
gosh
all kinds
mostly between the ages of $unc$two and $unc$ten
uh-huh
a few summers ago i kept $unc$two children every day for the entire summer
and they became like my children
id think so
and they live in an apartment complex
so we swam a lot
and we played on the playground a lot
and then we would go to a movie on $unc$thursdays
and there was always an activity
they had their favorite t v shows and things like that that we watched
and then we took naps
and i dont know
it just seems like there was always something to do
children are so full of energy
uh-huh
and they just keep you going
was this a $unc$one parent or $unc$two parent family
$unc$one parent
$unc$one parent
yeah
shes just
how much time did she spend with them
not much at all
i would get there at $unc$eight oclock in the morning
the children usually werent awake by then
and she would get home at $unc$five $unc$thirty in the afternoon
uh-huh
and they would have dinner
and then it was time for them to go to bed
uh-huh
at this particular time the children were $unc$two and $unc$six
but then i also
ive been baby-sitting this child for about $unc$eight years
hes $unc$nine now
and ive watched him grow up
and hes like a little brother to me
uh-huh
and its changed over the years
we get along a lot better now that hes older
uh-huh
and we do different things now
we used to play ball a lot
but now he likes to watch t v
and hes into wrestling
and i kept him on $unc$friday night
we went to go see a movie and things like that
but i feel like i dont know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them
yeah
you say you go to school
uh-huh
i go to $unc$l $unc$s $unc$u
and what are you studying
communications
sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children
yeah
i love children
uh-huh
i dont know
when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high
and i dont
i think it was very beneficial to us
uh-huh
in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books
and we went skating a lot
and she was just always there for us
but nowadays if there are $unc$two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does
and the children either stay at home and get into trouble
or theyre stuck in a day care
and i just dont want my children to have to be raised like that
all my friends their parents worked all the time
they got to stay at home by themselves
and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like i couldnt ride my bike across the street but they could because their mom would never know it
uh-huh
yeah
but now i realize that it was better because they have got into a lot of trouble because of lack of supervision
uh-huh
that certainly can happen now if
you say youre in communications
uh-huh
what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to
im majoring in public relations
public relations
so you would have a job with a company rather than radio or television or newspapers or what have you
yeah
yes maam
right
uh-huh
yeah
and then youd be willing to give up your job to stay home stay with the children
i would like to stay at home with my children for at least the first $unc$five years
uh-huh
but what i plan to do in the future is go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach college
uh-huh
uh-huh
and in that case then ill be at home when my children are at home
but id like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten where theyre at school from what $unc$eight to $unc$three or something
uh-huh
and then i would be at my school teaching
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and
thats is an advantage of being in the education field
i spent $unc$thirty-four years in education
really
yes
and so
what grade
i started out with college and then went to high school
and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college because you have a closer relationship with the students that
did you
what did you teach
i taught physical education
i started out as a $unc$p $unc$e major in education
uh-huh
i wanted to be a $unc$p $unc$e teacher
i sure did
i found that it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
yeah
and it worked out fine from that standpoint plus the fact that when i left
usually my husband was seldom home for maybe $unc$forty-five minutes or so
and then our son he had to get on the bus
uh-huh
and he did get on the bus
it was his responsibility
and he never ever thought of not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school because i
absolutely
i was in physical education then
and i just kept getting pushed into administration
wound up in administration
and so he thought surely that i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case
oh
and i wouldnt have checked on him
however there are points both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working
yeah
i listened to more than $unc$one parent say i dont know what this child wants
im working $unc$two jobs
they each have their own television
they each have their own telephone
they each have their own rooms
they each have this
they each have that
id say but what they dont have is you
thats right
they need some attention
absolutely
and i think out
because that is the way of getting attention
whenever my mom stayed home with us we did without a lot
we were
its hard to make it on $unc$one income
thats right
but we did
and we lived in a trailer for $unc$eighteen years
and we only had $unc$one car
we only had $unc$one telephone
uh-huh
we didnt get to eat out all the time
but i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar
right
and i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up
and i hope that i can provide that for my child too
and we need more of that
we need more parents willing to supervise
though weve had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of church and school and everything along the way
we have
and that i think has contributed much to the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that were having that the students parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very beginning
and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades $unc$one $unc$two and $unc$three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until theyre in the ninth and tenth grades
uh-huh
its too late then
you cannot reverse that trend at that point
it is
its way too late
right
i agree
and while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the childs in the elementary school
and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point
and that is just as valuable at that time as to the rush in the elementary
it is because all the peer pressure it starts in high school
yes
right
and the parent really needs to be there for the child
right
and the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something
we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football
and i did keep statistics for his team
and his dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team
great
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time
yeah
so i feel that i learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents
and a thing such as
$unc$one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors was carrying their
when i was your age i didnt have this or that
uh-huh
and i never ever said that because i knew that that was $unc$one thing that was really irritating to young people
i guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students
yes
and i had to deal with their problems
and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect
and our son would share this
and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of lines so that i think he benefited from my experiences
does your son work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
oh
no
he works for a different company
yeah
in the $unc$dallas area
but when he went away to coll-
and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and a small and all the way through college
and he held $unc$three jobs $unc$wally was in college
and we didnt even know it
goodness
he didnt even tell us that he had $unc$three jobs
but when he graduated he had a $unc$five $unc$thousand dollar bank account
and we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go
if he got married he was on his own
if he flunked out he was on his own
okay
yeah
$unc$one year public service for everybody
that was it right
right
who wants to start this one
em-
i dont know
ive been sitting here thinking
yeah
because it took a couple tries before i found somebody
im not really sure what i think about this
the first thing is if its going to be mandatory its got to be mandatory
everybody not just poor people and all that but senators sons and all that stuff too
right
right
everybodys got to do it
i dont know
itd probably be good
i just dont know if i was $unc$eighteen or whatever id want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
im not sure i want an $unc$eighteen year old to make that kind of decision
that doesnt sound right
i guess i see overall beneficial if were going from that point of view
uh-huh
in the past
i dont know how old you are
but when i was in high school it was the beginning of $unc$vietnam and so forth
and many of my peers were being drafted
uh-huh
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever
but i felt strongly then that even if they didnt feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out lots in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available
uh-huh
and i guess i see that as not so much a demand but a privilege
its something
it is
its
since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea
i wouldnt mind doing it at $unc$forty-four
uh-huh
and i find ways to turn some of that back to others
and i guess i cant see that as being something to really object to
i guess it would still depend on how
if youre talking about something thats like $unc$one year full time this is what you do
youre going to go and fill pot holes and all that stuff
i dont know
i could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities
things that need to be done that could be done in an hour or $unc$two a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on $unc$saturday or something like that in addition to what one does besides that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i cant imagine what kind of bureaucracies wed get into and expense having it be full time
youre going to go to this camp
and youre going to
back in the $unc$depression the $unc$c $unc$c $unc$c
yeah
it was needed
it gave some folks some jobs
and we got some great public works out of it
but i dont see that as being necessary now
i can see it being done on a regular schedule
uh-huh
everybody has to put in so many hours of public service in a given time perhaps
uh-huh
i guess i see all of us benefiting
and i dont see it just relegated to the young
but i see so much going on thats bad
and this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem
uh-huh
something that they turn back
and also you feel more like youre actually part of the community if youve done something in it
thats right
you take pride in that and get some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself
uh-huh
and i see it being most beneficial if its in at least the area where the person lives
definitely
it might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then youre coming in contact with it
its not as meaningful for me to go to $unc$minnesota and do something up there that ill never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there
right
yeah
it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going
yeah
but as far as putting that into work i dont want to deal with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics of it
that would be a nightmare
and just getting it going
yeah
yeah
i see a lot of things like scouting $unc$boys $unc$clubs $unc$girls $unc$clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship the looking after the environment sort of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i guess i dont see this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
do you have kids
no
not yet
in about $unc$six months we will
good
youll have a little time think about that
i guess i have
when i was teaching school i saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that didnt really have a purpose
and i can see some really significant things coming out of it
uh-huh
i know youve got to get past that grudge attitude that many have
but that would be a part of selling it to the community
uh-huh
the adults ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation there definitely would have to be a major $unc$p $unc$r campaign in each community each county parish or however the state was divided up
uh-huh
i may
i dont know
around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for
$unc$boy $unc$scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will police a couple of miles of the highway and kee-
and ive seen it in other states too
yeah
they have that here
i dont know
theyve got in most of the states around here i think
down in $unc$north $unc$carolina there was a big controversy for a while because the local chapter of the $unc$k $unc$k $unc$k wanted to participate in it
and it was interesting because thats an interesting question
and there were those that said no
you cant do that im sure
yeah
should these people be allowed to or not
i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
oh
and i hadnt even thought about the other end of that
thats an interesting situation
i hadnt thought of that
we had visited relatives in $unc$virginia not too long ago
and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up
and
yeah
i think virginias got it
and i know $unc$maryland does
and we went to indianapolis last weekend and back
and im pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in $unc$ohio and $unc$indiana about it and maybe $unc$pennsylvania
i dont remember for sure now
and i dont know about your part of the country
but down here in the last year plus it was beginning with last years $unc$earth $unc$day theres just been more of a turn toward environmental concerns
uh-huh
and i work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
uh-huh
and theyve started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said its not feasible
uh-huh
its not a good idea
and i see that as being a change for the positive kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing
yeah
but then they lost too much business
its just a part of everyones consciousness
uh-huh
the thing about that is though its got a
because it was big you remember in the early seventies and all that
and then it kind of just went out of vogue
and im worried that the same thing will happen
its like environmentalism was really big for a couple of years
and then people
id rather spend $unc$fifty cents less on such and such
and even if its not environmentally safe who cares
im sure the pendulum will swing the other way
there have been too many other things that its done that for just in my life
and if you look at history at all you see that we go from $unc$one side to the other on just about any subject that one might care to bring up
yeah
but it is comforting to me to see more concern about some of these things that cost us money
especially when we have dwindling resources such as oil thats burning out of control in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf and so forth
just every little bit does
it makes me feel better
it makes me feel like there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth
yeah
wouldnt
its just probably a good thing that the oils burning and may make some people realize that hey this stuff runs out
thats right because
of course thats probably blasphemy for you to say coming from where you are in $unc$texas
no
no
because if we
what was it $unc$seventy-four when we had the last oil crisis
and we started getting smart
and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
uh-huh
and as soon as the oil prices came back down the pendulum swang the other way
right
and we need those reminders
yeah
or well suddenly be in the dark and say my goodness now we dont have the ability to go on to some new technology
right
my dads in the solar energy business
so were acutely aware of a lot of this
ah!
but on the other hand he voted for $unc$george $unc$bush
so i wonder sometimes if he knows what hes doing
i thi-
just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not makes decisions that i just cant go along with
uh-huh
but thats why theyre there and not me
i dont want the stress
yeah
the thing with $unc$bush
okay
i was just trying to think about how i dress for work
$unc$t $unc$i is a very casual atmosphere
uh-huh
and what i usually do on the weekend is lay out $unc$five outfits
and on $unc$monday i wear the worst looking one because it doesnt seem like people are that alive on $unc$monday
so
yeah
and then progressively through the week ill wear nicer looking things
and then on $unc$friday most everybody wears jeans and sweatshirts or jeans and blouses or something like that
but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or skirts and pullover sweaters or little $unc$two piece dress suits like
but
yeah
thats a good way to approach it
ive never thought about
i do plan my clothes a week in advance
actually i plan them a month in advance
i usually do a month at a time
so i dont repeat an outfit
uh-huh
but ive never thought about wearing your worst outfit on $unc$monday because really no ones paying attention
but i dont work outside of school
i work in the computer lab at school
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school
and really its
i try to dress presentable but very comfortable
right
in the warm weather its always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that
and then in the winter time its jeans or pants
i usually
college is so casual
you really dont want to dress up unless you have a job
and you have to be there right after school or something like that
so
right
where i work its pretty casual
i guess its more like a college campus
also theres hundreds of people work for $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
and a lot of people just wear jeans and sweats all the time
and they dress up when customers are coming in or when we have department meetings or something like that
and a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real higher ups like the $unc$t $unc$i lawyers and those that work for the higher executives those secretaries they really dress up all the time
uh-huh
oh
so theres a good combination in the hallways all the time
thats good that theyre so casual
yeah
my brother works for $unc$t $unc$i
and hes a computer engineer
uh-huh
uh-huh
and whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday
but he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes
uh-huh
and he just loves it
and thats very acceptable at $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
i believe at $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m they make you wear a blue suit and some kind of colored shirt and a tie
thats what ive heard
uh-huh
i would hate to be in that atmosphere
but they just moved into the new building
he calls it the new building
i dont know
its where all the executives are
uh-huh
and so they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans
but he just left for $unc$italy today at $unc$four
oh
and hell be over there until $unc$july first setting up some kind of computers for them
i see
for $unc$t $unc$i but over in $unc$italy
yeah
$unc$t $unc$i is everywhere
yeah
he was so excited about going
uh-huh
but he didnt carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude if i dont take it then they wont make me wear it
thats true
thats a good idea
because he didnt
hes not really into all that
he would wear it if he had to for his job and all
but his preference is blue jeans and a t-shirt
so
uh-huh
but i think thats great about $unc$t $unc$i
and also to get off the clothing the smokers how they have the different designated areas for smokers and stuff
the
no
right
i think thats great
yeah
and if you happen to go into $unc$one of areas that is a smoke area and you dont smoke you almost strangle
really
do you smoke
so much smoke in the air
yeah
the smoking area its closed in
uh-huh
and if you dont smoke and you go in there
everybody that goes in there smokes
so its full of smoke when you go in there
i used to smoke a long time ago
i think thats
i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes
i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes
thats $unc$one of the reason that i stopped
you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college
when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions
and
yeah
yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes
thats how i am
but my mamma was not raised like that
and so
no
i wasnt either
my daughter shes real good at finding sales though
me to
boy i have to hunt them down
shell buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons and just have them for the next year
uh-huh
and she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and buys clothes
when they were coming up i didnt sew
but now ive learned how to sew
so im still learning how
and im getting much better at it
and im going to be able to make my own clothes
thats great
i wanted to take a sewing class at school
but i just havent fit it into my schedule yet
but that can really benefit
right
thats something that id be very interested in learning
right
because clothes are really expensive
theyre outrageous!
a little simple shell blouse that you can make for about say $unc$ten dollars at the most out of a decent fabric boy runs you like $unc$twenty something dollars in the store
uh-huh
yeah its marked up
just a little shell to go under a suit
it is really outrageous
but whenever i was growing up and all my mom
i never understood this then
but i do now
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were $unc$thirty dollars
or she wouldnt buy me the $unc$fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that
uh-huh
and she always told me it was because i was still growing
and she wasnt going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week
right
especially to pay that kind of money for it
yeah
i have a friend who
she had a little boy
and she used to dress him out of $unc$neiman $unc$marcus
she dressed him fabulously
no
and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff
uh-huh
and she finally learned that you just can not do this
so now she finds the basement sales just like everybody else
thats the best way to shop
i always thought my mom was being mean to me
but i look back at it now
and my child is going to
im going to raise mine the same way
right
i dont know
theyre just so outrageously priced
its just incredible
yes
and you
i try to always catch the sales
right
always
and yeah
and you just have to keep buying them
if youre not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great for the price that you pay
yeah
it depends on
yeah
theres always a reason why theyre on sale
right
so that has a lot to do with it
right
but
i bought the most beautiful sweater from i believe it was $unc$ross $unc$dress for $unc$less
and it was really pretty
it was just a plain round necked sweater
uh-huh
and it was embellished around the top
it had leather designs and some other little things on it
and i just thought it was so pretty
and i got it at a real good price
i think maybe it was $unc$nine $unc$ninety-nine or something
thats great
and it was so pretty
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was so cheap
uh oh
in the middle of the back of it there was
its like there
it had been slit
and they had just sewed it back together right in the middle of the back
no
wasnt a seam or anything
uh-huh
and thats why it was so cheap although its not really noticeable from the outside
but still its really not a good quality
and then i was told by somebody that works for $unc$j $unc$c penneys that $unc$ross is just $unc$one of those places that sells seconds
the defect
yeah
yeah
they dont really buy the first quality
they buy the second
and places like $unc$j $unc$c penneys theyll reject the seconds
theyll send them back every time
uh-huh
but places like $unc$ross $unc$dress for $unc$less and $unc$t $unc$j $unc$max
$unc$t $unc$j $unc$max does that
uh-huh
yeah
we have a $unc$t $unc$j $unc$max over here
and
okay
what do you think about it
the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
yeah
i think a lot of it has to do with women working
$unc$uh-huh
yeah
i do too
i think its going to
in the future i think all women are going to work
yeah
they may let you off for a day or $unc$two to have your baby
but that will be it
yeah
or either theyll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you just continue right on with your work
yeah
it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them
right
right
they cant even afford to take off to have children it seems like
and it seems if youre going to have kids that society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
yeah
because if you have $unc$two if you go to work youre just working to pay for day care $unc$two or $unc$three
right
i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when i had them and when they were small until my youngest got in junior high i didnt have to work
uh-huh
that is good
i didnt work
i needed to
but i didnt
yeah
$unc$steve has a sister who has $unc$four
she just had her fourth one in $unc$march
and she doesnt have to work either
i dont know how they do it
i dont know how people do it with $unc$one
obviousl-
let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wo-
yeah
obviously we dont have any
and i think thats part of the role reversal is its okay to get married and not have kids
yeah
and i think society for such a long time said youre married now you need to have your family
and i dont think its been until recently that they had decided that $unc$two people was a family
right
right
and
its getting where if youre going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you cant hardly afford to have over $unc$two
right
and its hard with $unc$two
we
my youngest $unc$one
i have $unc$two
i have a son and a daughter
and my youngest $unc$one is going to be graduating from college soon
oh!
and if i had a third $unc$one i just dont know where it would come from
yea-
yeah
because i work now
i work full time
and it
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
yeah
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that
that helps out
but still it cost a lot
yeah
just the cost of living and loans dont pay for groceries and stuff
right
and cars and all their books
and the books are outrageous absolutely outrageous
i know
i know
and theyre getting worse
my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for $unc$one of her next classes
and it was like $unc$ninety-six dollars
gee
and this book is a little bitty skinny book
yeah
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold
yeah
but its getting worse
and if id of probably had $unc$three or $unc$four children i dont see how we could have made it without me working
but thats probably because if you had $unc$three you would say if id of had $unc$four
i guess its always not being able to picture $unc$one more
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
right
but i think i would have had to work
yeah
if id of had that many id of had to work in order for my kids to
even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
yeah
but i think its getting more and more like when you have $unc$one child now thats it
then you go to work
and you work
yeah
because if you have $unc$two or $unc$three kids by the way the inflations going i think a womans always going to have to work
and its just going to be an accepted thing
there isnt going to be any of this very few people will ever stay home
yeah
and thats all right with me because i dont want to stay home
yeah
i think im just part of the new stuff that is just
i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
i cant imagine how i did because now i work all the time
yeah
and i work all week
and i cant imagine how i stayed home
yeah
i think to myself what did i do
and i think it revolutionized where a woman thinks that a way just like
my daughter theres no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that shes at now
to her everything is youve got to go through college youve got to get a job
and then when everythings set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with
but it is so far down the road
right
when i graduated high school the thing
thats what you did
uh-huh
and then you got married
and then you had a family
thats just the way it was
yeah
and thats like when my mo-
i know when my mothers age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first
and the woman stayed home and took care of them
an
i like the way it is
yeah
its being
were from $unc$houston and so its not so hard for people
youve been married $unc$three or so years
and you dont have kids its okay nobody does
but you come to a place like $unc$belton
and th-
a lot of the kids here get married out of high school
uh-huh
its real small town
and i-
and a lot of people in our $unc$su-
were the only couple in our $unc$sunday school class except for $unc$one other couple who are in their forties
and they cant have children dont have children
and they cant imagine why we would want to have children
and im going theres life in there thats
not everybody has to have kids
and id rather spend the time with my husband than spending time
its your turn
yeah
but you know that even
whenever i was coming up and everything
and we got married right out of high school a year after i got out of high school
uh-huh
and i didnt have kids for $unc$four and a half years
but that was because i wanted to work
and i wasnt ready for kids
yeah
i think thats what it is
im not either
and everybody thought my gosh what is the matter with her
theyre probably going i bet she cant get pregnant
right
they thought that it was terrible
and then when id tell them im just not ready for children yet
but that you better just get ready now
yeah
you dont just get ready
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year
yeah
and i just was not ready for kids
i wanted to get out and work a little bit
and i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did
and kids didnt fit in right then
but its getting more and more like that where theres more and more couples
and if you dont want the kids then its not the time to have
i dont care what anybody tells you
right
and i think that more and more the attitudes getting that way
because thats like my daughter
now she says that maybe when shes $unc$thirty she might want a child then
yeah
and even though id like to have grandchildren i can see her point
yeah
steves mom finally said that $unc$god will take care of us when its our time
right
she finally told me its okay if you dont
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because shes from a very very old fashioned family
uh-huh
and she stayed home and raised her kids
and she expected all of her kids to do that too
and their wives to be the housewife and have dinner ready by $unc$five and be there at every beck and call
and i was raised totally opposite
how we got together i dont know
because my mother had $unc$six girls
and she worked too
yeah
and i guess i just
and i saw how life was when she stayed home
and it was rough
it was hard
and
yeah
and it really is
i know
just like now theres so much more now
all my income goes for things like luxuries
it really does accept for what we give to my daughter to put her through college and stuff
uh-huh
but the rest of it
we just buy things like boats
or we go on trips the more or less like entertainment stuff
right
but
yeah
i think youve earned that though
yeah
i feel like i have because were just a age now
im not old
but im older
uh-huh
and i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do
but now i could not go back and do it
yeah
and i did stuff
but to me it feels like i must have done nothing
right
and i think its just the new way that people are thinking
yeah
i think so
but
i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
more and more of them are
i dont know if it is up there where you are
but where i am just all the hospitals theyre getting day care
uh-huh
are they
but the reason they had to do this was because so many women could not afford
like you said if you had $unc$four kids or even if you had $unc$two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those $unc$two kids to go
right
more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them
and then some of the bigger companies
but its mainly the hospitals
yeah
i dont know if the $unc$t $unc$i in $unc$dallas does or not
i know nobody around here does it
its too small around here
really
yeah
all right
okay
i can go ahead and start and tell you mine
and
okay
were from $unc$san $unc$antonio
and thats where i grew up
so i was used to the heat out here right now
yeah
it gets to about high seventies
and it gets very cold at night
uh-huh
and $unc$monterey its right on the coast
and i dont know if your familiar with $unc$california coastline
but were about a $unc$two hour drive south of $unc$san $unc$francisco
okay
and its really nice
its a big area for people to come from the different countries mostly like $unc$japan $unc$germany and $unc$england
and they usually go to $unc$carmel and vacation on the beaches
so its pretty nice year round
but always cool in the evenings and warm in the summer
but its stays pretty cold even during the $unc$winter for as nice as it is
uh-huh
and we usually get a fog right about $unc$four oclock
and it kind of rolls in over the coast
and then it usually breaks back off again the next morning
and if you go just a little bit ways in id say about a $unc$fifteen minute drive in towards $unc$salinas the weather completely changes
uh-huh
and it gets very hot and dry
and the fog never makes it that far
uh-huh
but along here its very different from the $unc$texas type weather
whats it like down there
right now were having the little bit of $unc$spring that we have
really
at least youve got some
we dont have many seasons here
it goes from $unc$winter to $unc$summer usually
uh-huh
$unc$spring usually consists of a lot of rain especially thunderstorms
we had $unc$one of those blow through tonight
thats good
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next $unc$two or $unc$three days
uh-huh
have yall been having any heat waves or the $unc$ninety degree
its gotten up to $unc$ninety a couple of times
uh-huh
but basically its been in the low seventies and eighties
uh-huh
women thats good for this time of year
yeah
its not really been too bad
uh-huh
usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier
uh-huh
do yall have many bluebonnets and stuff this year
yeah
quite a bit
uh-huh
the season is just about over for that
in fact we drove down to $unc$corpus last week
uh-huh
and there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
i miss that
drove through $unc$san $unc$antonio
and i spoke to somebody else this morning from $unc$san $unc$antonio
and were
they had
and we came back
what day was that $unc$sunday evening
and they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing were getting now i guess
thats real nice because i can remember $unc$two years ago that in about $unc$february the $unc$hundred degree weather started in $unc$san $unc$antonio and just continued
at least yall are getting some rain up in $unc$dallas
im glad to hear that
yeah
thats the second or third year in a row that weve had a real rainy $unc$spring
uh-huh
we had a pretty rainy $unc$fall last year as well
yall werent getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you
weve had a few down here but not anything like $unc$kansas
uh-huh
but this is the season for that
gosh
they do pop up occasionally around here
uh-huh
yeah
i really dont miss all the heat there
yeah
im getting acclimated to have the cool evenings
so we get a bit of a relief
yeah
im from here originally
so when its $unc$july and $unc$august im pretty well used to the $unc$hundred degree temperatures
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil
its that black clay soil
is that what $unc$dallas is
okay
yeah
its not sandy like most of the state is
so it doesnt absorb the water real well
uh-huh
once it rains a little bit its filled up and everything else just runs off
uh-huh
yeah
$unc$san $unc$antonio has that same problem when the rains come
its a complete mess everything floods all the under passes
yeah
i didnt realize that $unc$dallas had that same problem
yeah
we have it
especially as rainy as its been in the last couple of years
and theres a section in $unc$south $unc$dallas thats had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
uh-huh
we could use some rain up here
were in the bottom of the fourth year of drought up here
really
and they had a pretty good early spring
and we got quite a bit of rain
but it wasnt enough to offset what they lost over the last $unc$four years
uh-huh
so theyre still talking water rationing this $unc$summer
so it would seem strange because in $unc$san $unc$antonio
we had lived out west of $unc$san $unc$antonio in $unc$castroville
uh-huh
and the water in $unc$medina $unc$lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
and i thought gee im so glad to get out of there and get up here to the $unc$california $unc$pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers
and theres no problem with water
and then i came here and found out they were in the $unc$four year draught
uh-huh
so i said this is pretty much like $unc$texas
and it pretty much is in the middle of $unc$summer
they have rolling hills around here
but they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
but its a really nice area
its just such a change from $unc$texas because i had grown up with the heat
uh-huh
and used to essentially
like you said you have the cold $unc$winter
and then you have the hot $unc$summer $unc$spring
uh-huh
and to come here its kind of the temperate weather all year round
its kind of like $unc$spring i guess year round and then in the $unc$winter
and then it seems sort of like a $unc$san $unc$antonio early $unc$winter or $unc$fall year-round
uh-huh
so it seems like we only have $unc$two $unc$springs or $unc$two seasons
and that would be $unc$spring and $unc$fall
yeah
we never really get any of the other ones
uh-huh
but its a really nice change of pace
i guess id prefer that
yeah
to the heat
i really dont miss the heat
yeah
we do a lot of
when you do a lot of outside running and stuff its just so much easier up here
uh-huh
and you dont have to worry about the high humidity
yeah
does $unc$dallas get high humidity
or is it pretty dry
its pretty dry
we get some when its this rainy
but its nothing like i guess $unc$san $unc$antonio $unc$summers
its nothing like $unc$houston
uh-huh
or $unc$east $unc$texas is a little more humid
yeah
it seems like $unc$san $unc$antonio is increasing in humidity over the years
because i had lived in $unc$san $unc$antonio for about $unc$twenty years
uh-huh
and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid and here its right by the ocean
uh-huh
but its not the same as $unc$corpus
$unc$corpus you get that humid salty feeling in the air
uh-huh
but here the water is extremely cold up here
you can lay on the beach all you want
but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit and a thick wet suit at that because its just extremely cold
uh-huh
and i
for some reason because of the cold ocean water the air is always cool
its never humid or sticky or salty feeling
so i really like that about this area
and we just hadnt expected it
we were used to what gulf coast weather was like when we came here to $unc$pacific coast weather
yeah
its just completely different
and its much nicer
yeah
$unc$probably the $unc$pacific breezes make a lot of difference
uh-huh
it does
and the air doesnt feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region
but you
but we like it
so its a nice change
so well be here a couple of years
and we thought well take advantage of it and see what all the $unc$pacific coast is like
thats nice
its been good
my wifes originally from $unc$virginia
and we lived there for about $unc$nine months
and that was a real change for me
i imagine
$unc$virginia i imagine gets real humid doesnt it
parts do
were over in the western edge in the mountains
and they have of course some pretty severe storms $unc$winter storms snow and that type of thing
uh-huh
but theyre so good about clearing the roads that it doesnt usually bother you very much
uh-huh
yeah
not like $unc$texas where everything comes to a stand still
yeah
their $unc$springs and $unc$summers are pretty mild too
it never gets real real hot
uh-huh
ill have to try that out because i had heard that $unc$north $unc$carolina was sort of like that
uh-huh
and ive just never really been in that region of the country
and i guess im going to have to try that area sometime and see what its like
because a lot of people that are from that $unc$north $unc$carolina region really like it
and they get the snow
but they said it doesnt really get messy
and it doesnt really hang around that long
yeah
the people i know that are from there they always miss it
and they want to go back
nothing seems quite as good
but
as we were talking the weather came on
and theres a flash flood watch and more rain for the next $unc$three or $unc$four days
gee-whiz
gosh
i hope it moves up this way
but im sure it wont
yeah
maybe we can send you some
yeah
because we could sure use it
you think that takes care of the time and
i think that will do it
okay
i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in $unc$texas and
i enjoyed talking with you $unc$lisa
yeah
good luck to you
uh-huh
you too
okay
well see you
bye
bye
what movies have you seen recently $unc$valerie
lets see
the last $unc$one we saw was $unc$thelma and $unc$louise
we havent seen that $unc$one yet
dont bother
it wasnt that good
from a womans point of view it was very chauvinistic as far as women go
it was entertaining
but yeah
i dont think the general audience would go for it
the most recent $unc$one that my wife and i have seen was the city slicker
how was that
that was excellent
it was just a really funny movie
that is $unc$one ive been dying to see
at the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves
there were parts that were sad
it just ran the gamut of emotion
uh-huh
uh-huh
and
but it was just all around entertaining
how long did that movie run
its still on to the best of my knowledge
but time wise how long
was it $unc$two hour
or
i think its less than $unc$two hours
uh-huh
okay
okay
we rented $unc$one recently that seemed to go on forever
that always seems to happen when you rent them
yeah
but this $unc$one it was fairly long
im guessing probably an hour and $unc$forty-five minutes maybe
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it
but excellent acting by $unc$billy $unc$crystal and $unc$bruno $unc$kirby
was it good
uh-huh
who was the
$unc$jack $unc$palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
great
so we really enjoyed that
im looking forward to seeing that $unc$one
that was next on our list
so
yeah
i think that i can highly recommend that movie to see
okay
okay
good deal
yeah
good deal
do you rent movies very often
or
we generally rent a couple a week
in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend youve got to rent it on $unc$thursday
right
right
they get taken up at the store
thats exactly right
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
we will rent $unc$two or $unc$three movies on $unc$thursday
and with luck youll have $unc$one or $unc$two that are good
yeah
right
right
most of them are a coin flip
gosh
yeah
yeah
and we usually have we dont get out as much as we like
we have $unc$two children
so we occasionally get out to the movies
yeah
but its a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once
yeah
quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends
uh-huh
and well try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see
and generally try to stay in the at least p g range
uh-huh
what ages are they
have you found trouble finding movies for them
or
right
the oldest is $unc$nine
the youngest is $unc$three
he doesnt really pay attention
yeah
yeah
the $unc$five year old doesnt have the attention span either
uh-huh
uh-huh
but the $unc$nine year old will watch anything thats on t v
yeah
they have been doing that
weve been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see
the last $unc$one they saw was home alone
and they enjoyed that
but i missed that $unc$one
my husband took the kids to see that $unc$one
so
yeah
my wife took i think the kids to see that $unc$one
but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
thats a good deal
the
we saw this movie
presumed innocent was the $unc$one we rented last weekend
okay
let me think if i have rented that $unc$one
$unc$harrison $unc$ford
$unc$harrison $unc$ford and how does the story line go
he is a prosecuting attorney
and a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
okay
we havent seen that $unc$one
and hes trying to find it
but course its $unc$one of these with a twist where it looks like hes the $unc$one that wound up killing her
and its an extremely long movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
its over $unc$two hours long
gosh
gosh
which
my wife she likes the suspense movies
i enjoy them to a degree
uh-huh
i think thats the $unc$one i wanted to pick up the other day
and then my husband wasnt going to be able to watch it with me
so i thought i better save that $unc$one for another day
save that for another day
yeah
because i think hed like that $unc$one
yeah
you enjoyed that $unc$one then
yeah
its something i think you would enjoy
yes
uh-huh
okay
thats a good $unc$one to put on the list
its like most suspense movies
what was
it was on t v recently fatal attraction
uh-huh
its $unc$one that once youve seen it once you really cant see it again
right
okay
you know all the story and who did what and when it happened
uh-huh
so once you seen $unc$one thats a suspenseful type movie like that then its not good for a second watching particularly
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
at least i dont think so
i dont think too many of them are anymore
its a shame
but
i dont know
weve watched weekend at bernies any number of times
i know
its just slapstick comedy
no
sit there and laugh
and my $unc$one grandson and i
my wife cant understand it
but we like $unc$bill and teds excellent adventure which is another funny $unc$one
gosh
yeah
weve heard about that $unc$one
but we havent seen that $unc$one either
so it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies
yeah
we like to laugh
$unc$god
i have a theory
i like movies for entertainment
i dont want to go away depressed from watching a movie
right
right
right
i agree
i agree
lifes depressing enough
thats for sure
ive certainly enjoyed talking with you
you too $unc$jim
okay
bye
thanks for punching in
and
have a nice weekend
i hope you see a good movie soon
okay
okay
bye
bye-bye
okay
i guess were going to discuss food and cooking
alright
do you enjoy cooking
sometimes not all the time
im kind of that way too
i enjoy cooking when i have time
right
i dont enjoy preparing $unc$three meals a day everyday
yeah
thats about the same boat im in too
it gets kind of boring
yeah
how big is the family you cook for
$unc$five
uh-huh
we have $unc$four
and $unc$two of them are teenage boys
ill be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too
so
are they
and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have
yeah
yeah
yeah
we have that problem too
but also now its just the amount that they eat
its just absolutely incredible
yeah
my oldest is $unc$nine
and he already does that
yeah
does he
and i told him hes going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
yeah
thats true
do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal favorite recipes that youve come across or
my husband and i our favorite meal is
and we do it
for special stuff celebrations we have steak
uh-huh
and he does the steak
and then
out on the grill
uh-huh
uh-huh
and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does
ooh
and its real good
uh-huh
and i do sauteed mushrooms
how
so
yeah
and asparagus
and thats our favorite dinner
thats sound good
i love that
my husband really likes seafood
yeah
so do we
and i think that no matter what i do i dont serve enough of it really to suit him
i didnt grow up eating that much seafood
and so i dont know
its just kind of not natural to me
but i like it
yeah
and i dont know
$unc$one of his favorite things is
its called seafood stew
and its really like a soup that you serve over rice
uh-huh
and it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it
and
its not the $unc$one with all the shells and stuff in it is it
no
no
thats kind of $unc$louisiana i think if you do that
i dont know what that
yeah
i dont see how you eat that
but
i dont either
but
no
it is really good
and $unc$one thing thats good is it makes a large amount
and so usually we eat one
and i freeze $unc$two containers of it
oh
then thats just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice
but neither of my kids will eat it
yeah
so then they eat a pizza or
so it
yeah
it defeats the purpose
yeah
it really does
$unc$one thing ive run across recently though
a friend gave me a recipe that i really for chicken enchiladas
yeah
have you made them
yeah
my husband makes those
does he
i dont eat enchiladas
uh-huh
i dont like the tex-
i dont know
i guess its the texture or something
i dont like the taste of enchiladas
yeah
but everyone else in my family does
these are done with a flour tortilla
is that what he uses
yeah
yeah
i dont know
its i dont know what
i dont know
i dont know what it is about the enchiladas
i just
and im the only $unc$one including my $unc$mom and $unc$dad and my brother
im the only $unc$one that doesnt eat it
isnt that something
yeah
but my kids love it
i was going to say my kids both eat it
i guess thats $unc$one thing that i particularly like
but i think its good for company too
and ive made it a few times
and you can make a lot at $unc$one time when i needed to make something to give somebody to take over to somebodys house or something else
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
ive got a chicken casserole thats like that that ive
its nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family
and then
yeah
because when i make this chicken casserole it makes a real big casserole and then another $unc$one that i freeze
uh-huh
or i give it to my mom and dad if i know were not going to eat
what does it have in it
its jus-
you can use chicken or turkey
because my mom started making it right after thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
and its rice and
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in
im not real good about measuring
yeah
because i just
i do it to taste
uh-huh
sure
and
sometimes those are the best ones
yeah
but its just chicken
its as much as you want torn up and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and thats it and some hard-boiled eggs
yeah
that sounds good
and thats it
you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to heat it through
uh-huh
and you sprinkle those toasted onion rings on top of it for the crunchy
yeah
those are good arent they
uh-huh
and thats it
and it goes
that sounds good
and its filling because of the rice
right
you cook the rice before you put it in
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i bet the mayonnaise in there kind of gives it a tang that would be good
yeah
it gives it an extra little tang
i guess i would now use the new mayonnaise free
yeah
that cholesterol fat free
yeah
thats really wonderful that theyre coming out with so many new things like that because i told my husband this $unc$summer i love to eat chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
and basically it certainly a low calorie good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing
i know
and now its okay
and you can even
i used to just put a tiny bit in
now im just putting more and more in
i dont like tuna salad unless its got lots of mayonnaise in it
yeah
and it used to be like a $unc$hundred calories per tablespoon
and now its like $unc$twelve
yeah
oh!
i know
i just think thats the best thing to have happened
im just so excited about that
yeah
yeah
we did the low-cal stuff
with my kids i dont
they get enough sugar and stuff anyway
mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway
yes
and they dont need any added help
right
so when were here at home with sweets and stuff we dont really do that much
i do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and stuff like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
and drink wise they have $unc$kool-aid milk or water normally
yeah
when they go to their grandmothers house which is every weekend its a different story all around
thats when they as our family would say pig out
uh-huh
thats good
thats exactly what it is
$unc$one of my boys thats $unc$twelve has high cholesterol
really
have you ever found out about your kids
no
not yet
and my other one does not
year or so ago he found out
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did!
he was able to get it down
i think its mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol
yeah
hes never eaten any eggs
hes never had anything but skim milk
and ive never bought butter and things like that
but he just left for the doctor again
and its kind of back up
so he needs to be careful again
yeah
so weve really been talking about the foods for him to be sure to eat
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff
and so hes eating an apple a day for the last $unc$two days
and all that kind of stuff does really help
i think weve probably talked long enough
and
okay
i guess i enjoy eating out here and there
or its a good change from cooking and eating at home
and i guess i like a variety of restaurants
uh-huh
sometimes its fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal
and sometimes i enjoy going out having a formal meal
yes
and sometimes its nice to go out and have a salad
uh-huh
something
do you usually go out with the children or without them
a variety
i like to go sometimes without them
and sometimes its okay to take them along
so
right
sometimes i think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches
yes
so it just varies
we do a mix
sometimes its really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband
and it wouldnt even really matter which restaurant it was just to have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table
yes
yes
so i guess there are times i even say please dont sit us next to a table with other children
this is our night out
but where do you like to eat
we dont have any children
so we tend to like to try all sorts of different things
and were very attracted to exotic food
uh-huh
and we like indian food and thai cuisine and sort of gourmet mexican and things like that as well as tex-mex and italian and chinese and things of that sort
yes
of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too
right
and we probably go out $unc$one to $unc$two times a week
right
and were pretty much regulars at an local italian restaurant
which one do you like
momos
okay
its been a long time since weve been in there
but its good
theres an italian restaurant over by $unc$plano $unc$parkway there
pas-
uh-huh
is it camparis or something
ive heard about it
i havent been in there
its good
my husband had been in there several times
and actually we went in there for lunch $unc$one day
uh-huh
and their pastas were great
thats $unc$one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me
i like different kinds of food
so when we go out im always looking for something other than the standard menu even if its a mexican $unc$restaurant like something other than the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas
youre brave
yes
yes
and once in a while things backfire
weve gone for romanian food and lebanese food and things like that
$unc$god
and im not fond of some of those things
but well try anything
right
weve had ethiopian and not in $unc$plano of course
no
i dont think so
but we really do enjoy going out
and im pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires
even though traditional it can backfire
yeah
i think were supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant
how do you usually find a new restaurant
my husbands hes the ethnic fan
so hes
i dont know
you know what we read the $unc$d $unc$magazine
uh-huh
so do we
we check that and the $unc$friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there
uh-huh
they often do ratings of restaurants
so
right
we often save those and ventured out on from there just for something that had a high rating
uh-huh
we have found a number of restaurants either through $unc$d the $unc$friday paper and sometimes the $unc$observer which my husband usually picks up and also through coupons
okay
when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons
thats right
and when they say buy $unc$one get $unc$one free its hard to resist
so well go in
and very often well find a place that we like
and well stick with it
once they no longer give coupons well stay there
good
good
but weve found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper reviews
yeah
we use the coupons too
thats true
thats true
its wonderful particularly if you have more than $unc$two people and youve got say $unc$four or something like that
its very expensive to go out to eat
right
right
yeah
that is really $unc$one of our
its almost a hobby with us
i think thats ex- sometimes i think going out to eat its sort of a recreation
yes
just a change of pace from eating at home
yes
so i guess as far as service when we go out its nice to have someone come and wait the table and clear the table and
yeah
uh-huh
absolutely
and do the dishes
yeah
and do the dishes
and its kind of nice to
i always
a waitress or waiter that waits the table its nice that theyre attentive
but its not nice when theyre too attentive
yes
weve had experience with that too
so
my sister who also lives here in $unc$dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty
yeah
how we
but
it may help their tip may not
whats your favorite restaurant
i guess just in $unc$plano i like to go to $unc$souper $unc$salads
uh-huh
chilis is always fine
sure
i guess if we go into $unc$dallas we like the is it $unc$routh $unc$street $unc$cafe
weve never been there
you would like it
and thats supposed to be wonderful
youd like it especially it youre adventuresome
uh-huh
weve taken people there several times
and they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding
i guess its whether you call it southwestern
but we had venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful
ooh
and then i guess it must be seasonal
and weve been back
i guess its in the winter season
theyve never had it when weve been back
uh-huh
but you ought to try that
its very good
i would probably like that
$unc$one or $unc$two times in my life ive ever had venison ive loved it
but its just not
i dont know people who hunt
so
no
thats supposed to be a wonderful place
here in $unc$plano we tend to go to momos fairly often
and sometimes well go
we also go to chilis and colters $unc$bar $unc$b $unc$q
and there is a little thai place thats over on $unc$park that we go to
my husband particularly likes that
we go into $unc$dallas a lot because were both were from the $unc$richardson $unc$north $unc$dallas area up until fairly recently
and well go down to $unc$blue $unc$mesa $unc$grill mexican food
and
thats good
yes
ive been there
okay
why dont you start
you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
im already on my job
you are
so you reached me at my job
wonderful
how do you dress for work
my dress for work most of the time is rather comfortable and casual usually slacks and a soft colored shirt
uh-huh
the thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar and a suit and all of that sort of thing
uh-huh
but when i dont need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort i dont
uh-huh
youre in a church there
yes
uh-huh
this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool
and theyve told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are $unc$two year olds
and they have $unc$bible lessons
and they have all the things during the morning
but they still have snack time and play time
so im going to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just tennis shoes and play clothes
around there you can probably wear t-shirts and other things
but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and coats
yeah
im envious
its a beautiful day here
and its in the sixties
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons
its supposed to be $unc$eighty-five today
so youll still see people
its kind of an in between change that theyre in their $unc$summer clothes during the afternoons because you just cant stand the sweaters
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be $unc$fall so badly
today we wear coats
and as the day warms up we may go to light jackets
did you
but i dont think theres an escape from light jackets
i understand
the wind will take away a lot of body heat
are the people around you dressing similar to you
very similar
uh-huh
you dont have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
no
im not stuck with that kind of a situation
thats good
thats good
as i say unless it happens to be
yesterday i had to dress up and be more formal because i had a formal meeting at noon time
uh-huh
but then i can go home later in the day and be a little more casual
thats wonderful
and then if i have a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening
my husband has to take the bus into $unc$dallas and doesnt return all day
so he has to dress
and he just really hates it
they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit
and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said its just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
yeah
around here in a lot of places thats the way it is
uh-huh
there are expected dress codes
uh-huh
and the people need to follow that
i think years ago i used to be far more committed to the idea of a dress code
uh-huh
but ive relaxed a lot more as ive gotten older and become more comfortable with myself
i think thats great
i think thats good
its taken a long time to break away from that
i understand
but now that ive broken away from it im glad i have
another interesting thing on our end here is even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties
and i will run around to the store in slacks and tennis shoes
and she
you mean you dont need to wear little old house dresses any more
right
and pearls
and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school
so she tells me i dress young
but thats okay
thats a good idea
thats a good idea
theres not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing
no
there
i guess this is what you call a natural end
yeah
what kind of shoes do they wear down there
we wear
of course like i said if my husbands going downtown hes got the whole mens dress shoes
uh-huh
but for as out here just anything that the moms
we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
we can wear pretty much that although tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every situation unless you want to look like a gook
yeah
im sure they are there
yeah
im sure they are
thats right
im sure that true
its a lot different than working in a kids preschool
a lot different
thats right
you all have a nice day there
you too
and thank you for calling
thank you very much
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye
do you have any
sure
i have a $unc$springer $unc$spaniel
and her name is $unc$thumper
shes about $unc$seven or $unc$eight years old
i got her for $unc$christmas from my family back when we lived in $unc$nebraska
i like to hunt
and so i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like $unc$thumper that i could just go out and get all kinds of game
did it work
yeah
except we live in $unc$plano $unc$texas now
no
right
so
for many years i had a dog that was part $unc$springer $unc$spaniel
i just love them
her name was $unc$molly
but she isnt alive any more
we had her for $unc$fifteen years i think my family did and just loved her
she was the greatest went through $unc$two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
do you have a pet now
yeah
i have a cat now
he just turned $unc$seven also
and i got him in $unc$arizona when i used to live there
and he is huge
he is $unc$eighteen pounds
what kind of cat is it
just
i got him
he was born in the wild in a shed and had never been in a building when i got him
uh-huh
so he
and he must be cross part with some kind of desert animal because hes very long and lanky
but hes a very tame spoiled house cat now that ive had him for $unc$seven years
being born outside you didnt have any problems house training him
no
no
thats good
hes
yeah
hes great
and hes really spoiled though
but hes really big
so lots of times he seems to get in fights
and when he was younger i think he started them
and now i think he barely makes it
i think he gets beat up even though hes big because hes pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then
sure
and older
yeah
we went to a cat show at the $unc$plano $unc$center here in town
and we thought that we have a cat now
but we thought if we ever get another cat wed want something kind of unique
so we kind of looked around
and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats
and we sort of fell in love with the $unc$maine $unc$coon cats
ive seen them
i
theyre huge
yeah
i have seen them
they were
i cant remember
they used to be used on ships and for mousers
oh
so theyre very nautical too
ill be darned
i didnt know that
yeah
i just
i think im being accurate in the area of folklore
but im not sure
thats interesting
yeah
we kind of like
my family didnt necessarily like them as much as i did
but the manx is that the $unc$one that doesnt have a tail
yeah
it sort of has a bob tail
i kind of like that too
but
yeah
id love to go to a cat show
im a real cat lover
id have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let me
he doesnt really like mine let alone another $unc$one
ill tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog
and then i suppose our $unc$five minutes will be up
yeah
okay
i work for a university
and i went to $unc$omaha $unc$nebraska to recruit students
and i had some time off in the afternoon
so i went to a pet shop
and i saw these little $unc$springer $unc$spaniels
and so i decided this would really be a nice dog to have
so when i got back home to $unc$carney $unc$nebraska i told my wife about it
and i said this is just a
i can just hear the dog crying for me now
i know what you mean
and $unc$christmas is coming up hint hint
and so i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university
and $unc$one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours
and so we got to $unc$omaha
and i decided id take my friend over and show him the dog
and so i got over there
and she said thats too bad the dog has already been sold
and i didnt realize it
but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog
and she was in the back room
and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students
and he had the dog the whole time in his room
and i had no idea
and so we headed back to $unc$carney that night
and the dog rode in the car
and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat
and they left the dog in the car
and i guess while we were inside eating $unc$thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car
and finally we made it back to $unc$carney
and
i guess were recorded
okay
what
do you have any hobbies that you like to do
yes
cycling computers backpacking just about everything
i generically have millions of hobbies
all right
thats an interesting assortment
my husband is into cycling
in fact hes out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time
uh-huh
im not quite that bad
im just a weekend cyclist
do you do any handicraft type things i think was the question
handicraft type things
yeah
whittling or
yeah
just whittle away my life
no
no
i c-
nothing like that
i do some things
ive gotten into
i like to decorate things
and i do sweatshirts and t-shirts
and ive gotten to where i have started selling them at craft shows and things
thats pretty good
and i have done fairly well at them
ive had
a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed
but most of them have worked out pretty good
yeah
they
my only craft work is kind of like computers and go off to the little computer club meetings
and its kind of nice because ive made money at it too
considering i work for it a living
but ive got a couple of articles published
oh!
its kind of neat
yeah
what does a computer club do
i didnt know there were such things
yeah
just all over the place
they just get around and talk techy or else
like half the members are really expert
and the other half are really not
uh-huh
and we kind of help out the people who are really not
youre not into hacking or whatever
i think im a hacker
but im not the dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers
uh-huh
no
thats $unc$one of those sports i dont go for
thats kind of interesting hobby
what else did you
you said you did cycling
yeah
what was the other thing
backpacking
backpacking
we
yeah
i belong to a $unc$boy $unc$scout troop
it beats paying $unc$united $unc$way
i just donate a whole bunch of my time to the $unc$boy $unc$scouts and have fun
uh-huh
we have done that
our $unc$two older boys were in $unc$boy $unc$scouts
and my daughter was in $unc$girl $unc$scouts until just about a year ago
uh-huh
so weve done a fair amount of that in our spare time also
but it
i
thats a great thing to do really
have you been backpacking anyplace exciting
just last weekend went to $unc$davy $unc$crockett forest which is kind of out in east $unc$texas
uh-huh
and we go to places out in
lets see
whats that state north of us
that state
that $unc$one
yeah
yeah
that $unc$one
that $unc$one
okay
yeah
yeah
and
to the
by $unc$fort $unc$sill there
no
to a old $unc$indian fort thats out there
trying to think of the name of it
durn
yeah
no
sorry
no memory
uh-huh
have you gone to $unc$fillmont with the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
no
i missed out this last year
i wasnt able to get the time off but maybe next year
its a good possibility
ive always thought that would be a real fun thing to do
yeah
yeah
when i was a kid wed do the equivalent thing in the $unc$high $unc$sierras
that was loads of fun
uh-huh
does your whole family like to do it
for a vacation youd go backpacking
no
not quite because im not a whole family
im just me
okay
and you volunteer for the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
yeah
i rent my kids
uh-huh
sometimes
its better than owning on them and making payments on them and things like that
sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea
have
you said you did it in the $unc$high $unc$sierras
do you ever just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
yeah
yeah
not recently because the $unc$boy $unc$scouts makes it so that i go like once a month someplace
uh-huh
but theres some stuff that i want to do with $unc$sierra $unc$club and go down to $unc$grand $unc$canyon or something like that
they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
uh-huh
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you dont have to take $unc$twenty $unc$thirteen year olds with you which seems just a tad more relaxing
i
probably
probably
thats
my other things that i like to do in my spare time i like swimming
uh-huh
which is in now
ive done that
and i also
when i like something i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it
okay
is it $unc$mike
yes
do you repair your own car
i try to whenever i can
ive always been i guess a product of a handyman father
i tell you what count your blessings because it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves
th-
yeah
yeah
theres
although ill tell you over the years the cars get more complicated
thats why i dont do as much as id like
right
yeah
because theyve gotten complicated havent they
yes
$unc$one of my first cars was a $unc$fifty-six $unc$buick which after awhile i could take apart in my sleep if i needed to
uh-huh
is that right
yeah
it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
and now since then the closer a car is to a $unc$fifty-six $unc$buick the more i know about it
and then start getting into these $unc$nissans and the like
and i just cant keep up
yeah
i agree
about all i ever
i never was too mechanically inclined
but i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and
yeah
course they dont use points anymore
thats right
but they do still use plugs
yeah
yeah
and brakes ive always done a lot of changing brakes
uh-huh
and i could always do the alternator and starter
yes
i dont anymore
but i have a lot of times
yes
i understand
my last car repair actually had to do with brakes
and its $unc$one i did not do myself
i took the car my
i have a $unc$seventy-nine $unc$el $unc$dorado took it to be inspected
uh-huh
and the parking brake failed
so i got under there and messed with that adjustment to tighten it up
uh-huh
and that didnt do the trick
uh-huh
and then i got there and tried to
it probably slipped loose didnt it
that wasnt even eventually the problem
i did everything that i could think to do
uh-huh
and eventually i brought it up to a place called $unc$just $unc$brakes
uh-huh
and it turns out that theres a
the parking brake in the rear
theres disc brakes
and the parking brake is a piston deal
and because the parking brake hadnt been used in so many years the piston froze up
they ended up having to pound it out
and $unc$one of them they were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it
and the other $unc$one it was just frozen solid
so i ended up having to buy $unc$one
and all total it was just under $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done
y-
it really wasnt quite as bad as you thought was it
yeah
actually i think it was a lot of money
but i dont like i s-
it was a lot of money
but
yeah
but i
it got to the point where i didnt know what was going on
so
you had to have the help didnt you
thats right
thats right
yeah
do you still do much work on them then
i do
th-
that was just at the beginning of $unc$september
and whenever i can i do try
i
id say this
ive gotten to the point where i dont change the oil anymore only because
disposal is a problem
that is $unc$one problem
but also these fast oil change places you just cant beat them
thats true
for $unc$sixteen bucks not only will they change the oil in $unc$ten minutes and do as good a job as i can do but theyll lube too
thats true
right
that
ive quit doing that myself
yeah
but $unc$one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil
yep
thats right
but it
but no
i guess i-
that
and the main reason that its quick
have you seen a new movie lately
i am a student
and i have been actually watching more movies on video than being able to go out to see movies at the theater
uh-huh
i want to see the fisher king and catch $unc$robin $unc$hood
okay
i havent seen either $unc$one of those
what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though
lets see
im trying to just think of the ones that have come on
white palace which i thought was over hyped recently
youre catching me at minds end here
what have you seen recently
maybe you have seen dances with wolves
yes
okay
yes
what did you think of that $unc$one
enjoyed that quite a bit
i thought the cinematography was excellent
uh-huh
the story was
though it tended to be a little $unc$one sided it was good
yeah
it was believable
i just moved down in fact from $unc$south $unc$dakota in $unc$june
and thats when the movie was filmed
uh-huh
and when the movie came out we went
my dad lives in the state capital which is $unc$pierre
uh-huh
and it was filmed right outside of $unc$pierre
in fact the big buffalo herd scene that was a live scene
wow
theres a guy that has got a buffalo farm
and he has got over $unc$ten $unc$thousand head of buffalo and my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo
it was really neat
so we are watching the movie in the movie theater in $unc$pierre
uh-huh
and just every time i would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey theres $unc$john $unc$red $unc$eagle
uh-huh
or theyd start recognizing people
they knew the extras or the
yeah
i think i enjoyed it more when i watched it on video cassette than i did in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time theyd say that
id go which $unc$one could that be
uh-huh
and id start trying to focus in on people instead of picking up the overall
scope
right
exactly
uh-huh
but i thought it was a good film
but you are right
i think it was very $unc$one sided
it was
but its a side that hasnt been told as far as telling it from the $unc$indians as the good guys and the white men as the bad guys
i really thought about all the westerns that we have seen for years and years
sure
and its just shoot the $unc$indians
and they are always the savages
right
in fact i was watching $unc$wild wild west last night
and it was a similar situation with the $unc$iroquois $unc$indians attacking an army fort
uh-huh
but it was an interesting movie
have you seen pretty woman
yes
i thought that was a good show
yeah
that was a good movie
it was just kind of a get away movie
yeah
kind of
it didnt have any real social bearing
and it wasnt really a comedy
but it was an enjoyable movie
it was kind of like the star wars series just something a little different yet believable
uh-huh
right
yes
youre bringing it
i dont know
i sure did have a mind lock about the movies ive seen
but yeah
ive seen pretty woman and dances with wolves
and
are you much of a star trek fan
are you going to see this next $unc$one thats coming out
definitely
have you seen the rest
yes
i think ive missed $unc$one
im not sure
but i think ive missed $unc$one
i actually went to the star trek $unc$twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago
and they showed all $unc$five in a row
was that here in $unc$dallas
they had it everywhere
every major city had $unc$one theater that did it
and
okay
because we had $unc$one here in $unc$dallas
right
and they did it in $unc$houston
they did it everywhere
and it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed
and the thing that i didnt realize is that if you watch the movies in a row time wise they happen $unc$one after another and just no time between them
uh-huh
but you can watch the characters develop
i said $unc$arlington $unc$texas because the other day i was talking with somebody
and he was in $unc$arlington $unc$virginia
no
yeah
thats the only one ive got now for this area
anyway weve got a easy subject
yes
we do
you go ahead first if youd like
okay
let me think here
favorite
i havent been watching much t v lately
yeah
you get so busy
i used to
yeah
i have $unc$one favorite soap opera
i still watch
and i tape because im not home
and lets see
thats $unc$general hospital
and then at night i dont usually sit down till almost $unc$nine oclock when my kids get in bed
i know
and then i watch
what do i watch at $unc$nine oclock
lets see
$unc$tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like
right
and
are they little
i have a $unc$seven year old and a $unc$ten year old
yeah
theyre pretty young
so we usually catch full house
and whats the $unc$one comes on after that
its a new $unc$one
i dont know
my kids are older
uh-huh
so i dont know some of those shows now like i used to
yeah
yeah
other than that i watch $unc$knots landing on $unc$thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else
right
yeah
i like the comedies
theyre just light too
i have to watch $unc$murphy $unc$brown
i really like
that is a good $unc$one
i make a point of that
that is
yeah
if im home on $unc$mondays then i definitely watch her
i love that
and i really like coach
i think when its good its just a scream
yeah
yeah
hes a good actor
he really is good
hes probably playing himself
half the time you see these people on an interview show they act just like they do in their parts
yeah
yeah
he
i saw him on $unc$johnny $unc$carson once
and he acted about the same
$unc$god
he could very well be
yeah
and
do you watch much t v
or
i watch more now because i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
uh-huh
but this semester im only taking $unc$one course
and so i see $unc$murphy $unc$brown and coach and the wonder years
i just make a point of seeing those
i never see that
ive got a friend that says that is just wonderful show
its fabulous
really you should never miss that
they are just gems of shows really fabulous in every way
nice
what night is that on
thats $unc$wednesday at $unc$seven $unc$thirty
$unc$wednesday at $unc$seven $unc$thirty
okay
yeah
$unc$wednesdays i go to church choir
so thats my $unc$one night out and about
yeah
so
sure
yeah
maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime
yeah
i should get him to do that because i know
just so you get the idea
it wouldnt take much to get hooked on those
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i watch those
are there any new ones this year that came out that you like
or
i havent
yeah
we started watching northern exposure
its not really new
but its still kind of new
uh-huh
uh-huh
hows that
i havent seen that
i like it a lot
its real different
in fact they never thought it would be a hit
theyll have some things in there almost like supernatural or something
somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does
or it sounds weird
but its very unique show and very well done
excellent actors
ill have to watch for that
i guess we just
it came on after something we used to watch
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i guess we just kept sitting there
and now we make a point of watching
i cant take all these shows on because next semester im not going to be able to watch hardly any television
uh-huh
then it will be mostly reruns i guess
yeah
yeah
and by the end of $unc$february the way they do it nowadays
we used to watch a lot of designing women
but
but i havent seen that much lately since they got rid of $unc$delta $unc$burke and brought on the new ones
yeah
yeah
ive seen that
was she the best $unc$one on that old show
she was just funny
really
she was really funny
and her character was good
i dont know that it was her in particular but just the character
right
right
so
yeah
they had a big fight on that show didnt they
yeah
yeah
they were all accusing each other of everything in the world
that was awful
and who knows still what really happened
i know
you never will probably
yeah
yeah
so
i think the latest soap opera for people is the $unc$kennedy trial for those who have cable
i know
i dont have cable
i told
no
we dont have that station either
so i havent been able to catch any of that
but just what little we caught on the news
its just as wild as any soap opera from what i hear on the news
i know it
and i think hes guilty as the devil
i dont see how he couldnt be
i know
whats in it for her
theres never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers
yeah
thats right
and they said this lawyer is unbelievable
but they said she held up so well yesterday
i know
everybody was saying that
and then in the paper said it
so it should be interesting
yeah
$unc$god
the $unc$national $unc$enquirer says
i was reading that in the supermarket line
i never have the nerve to buy the thing
shoot
do you watch any sports or anything like that
says he
or
no
i dont care anything about that
because i dont either
i cant watch it on t v
so
i like the ice skating
occasionally some ice skating will come on on a $unc$sunday or during the olympics
uh-huh
i always watch that
i think its so beautiful
yeah
i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too
yeah
thats good
i suppose we both have credit cards
uh-huh
yeah
they seem to be a part of life
yeah
yeah
how do you use them
i do use them
uh-huh
i have a few favorites that i use more than others
and i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable
i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to
uh-huh
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few
uh-huh
and they all can build up
uh-huh
i think theyre handy
i just get
i dont carry a lot of cash with me
uh-huh
and i hate writing checks when you go shopping
yeah
uh-huh
do you use credit cards
yeah
i use a few
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them
uh-huh
and so ive
and then i guess my mother
grandmother
yeah
so my mother learned from that
and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them
so basically i just keep them
i use them so that i build up a credit rating
uh-huh
but otherwise i generally
and my husband it turns out
ive just been married $unc$seven months
but he has the same habit
and we just keep a few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
thats good
but we always pay it off right that month so that we dont pay any service charge
thats wonderful
so that way we keep out of debt
and we keep on top of what were spending
the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing
yeah
its really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building
yeah
yeah
thats what i feel
so
but i know some people can get carried away with them and let them get out of hand
uh-huh
its really easy just to forget that you charged that or charged that
i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bills going to come
but sometimes i forget
and so a bill will come in
and ill think no i didnt know it was going to be that high
uh-huh
yeah
but so far weve been able to pay it off every time
so
thats good
right now im kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate
it seems that some of them have gotten higher
uh-huh
and i saw on t v they had a program on credit cards
and theyre supposed to
i dont know if it was $unc$tennessee or $unc$arkansas or some other state had a $unc$visa card that was the lowest $unc$one in the country
and i didnt write it down at the time
uh-huh
and then i went and looked to see what my $unc$visa was
and i think its $unc$eighteen percent or something
so think i want to find something that has a lower rate
yeah
have you ever used $unc$discover card
no
i havent
yeah
im not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off
but
is that the $unc$one from $unc$sears
i think $unc$sears originally put it out
okay
but its pretty well taken all over the $unc$u $unc$s now
ive havent found many places that dont take $unc$discover
and theres no annual service fee which is good
okay
and then they also give you they say cash back at the end of the year
for the amount that i charge i get $unc$two dollars back or something
uh-huh
but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back
they give you money back for using your credit card
yeah
basically
thats it
i didnt know that
and i think the service charge is pretty low too
but im not sure
$unc$sears was $unc$one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
uh-huh
i worked at $unc$sears for over $unc$ten years
and it was only a $unc$sears card that they would take until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with another credit card that was accepted
uh-huh
uh-huh
so now theyll take the $unc$discover
but i still dont know if $unc$sears will take $unc$visa or $unc$mastercard
uh-huh
but i never did apply for a $unc$discover card
yeah
i just figure with the $unc$visa and $unc$american $unc$express i probably have an
uh-huh
i can do enough damage with those $unc$two
yeah
i think its best to keep the number down that you have
uh-huh
yeah
ive got some that i havent even used at all past few years
i probably wouldnt be able to use them
uh-huh
but i do like my dillards
i have to admit thats $unc$one of my favorite places to shop
uh-huh
and i do use dillards probably more than any of the other department stores
uh-huh
but
yeah
do you have anything else to say
no
not too much more about credit cards
okay
i dont think i do either
so
okay
it was good talking to you
good talking to you $unc$beth
okay
good luck
have a good evening
you too
bye-bye
bye
got any problems on $unc$mockingbird with crime
or is that a crime free zone there
no
i dont think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer
im afraid youre right
$unc$one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought somethings happens on $unc$mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
my
and they had stopped a stolen car and caught $unc$one of the men in the hedge
boy
and then the other $unc$one was on the roof in the back
by your house
on my house
my goodness
my
so im very much aware of crime in the cities and the concern about it
thats got to be a frightening way to spend an evening
it was
i kept hearing noises
and so i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage
so i got my gun and walked through the house into the garage
there was no $unc$one there
but i wanted to be sure
boy
is $unc$plano beginning to experience the kinds of things that are more common in the urban area
unfortunately yes
thats too bad
yes
i think as any city grows up you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think
fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on $unc$spring $unc$creek
but weve lived here $unc$sixteen years
and now you can tell the change for sure
uh-huh
i was thinking if youve been there that long youve seen $unc$plano grow from what was really a small town to a city
yes
$unc$central $unc$expressway with all the stores and the restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff its just prime pickings for people driving by
uh-huh
yeah
and
i was appalled to read the other day about the shooting on the tollway
that couldnt be too far from you neither
its farther west of me
okay
i live over near $unc$white $unc$rock $unc$lake
yes
okay
but
it was really frightening to think that its not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth
i never thought about someone robbing those
but apparently they do
i dont know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
but
yeah
it just doesnt seem possible does it
its kind of stupid isnt it
uh-huh
but i guess when people do those things they dont really give a thought of the consequences at the time
its looks like easy pickings
no
and away you go right
yeah
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in the theft and the violence that we see
i think youre right although i think that may be an excuse for people too
it is convenient isnt it
right
i didnt know what i was doing
right
that kind
right
just like the old alcohol idea
and i think when you have haves and have nots youre always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find its easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
and i work in $unc$south $unc$dallas for the $unc$dallas $unc$school $unc$system
boy
and
where do you work
do you know where $unc$oakland and $unc$hatcher are
yes
i think i do
is that $unc$amelia $unc$earhart $unc$school there
no
this is over near $unc$lincoln $unc$high $unc$school not far off $unc$south $unc$central $unc$expressway
okay
thats a pretty rough area there isnt it
it is a pretty rough area
were over by $unc$fair $unc$park
my goodness
and you watch the people
there are marvelous $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w and $unc$mercedes and $unc$cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns
and the kids see that
and they know that they can earn several $unc$hundred dollars in a day running for drug dealers if
definitely that area thats big time
uh-huh
big time there sure is
it surely is
i dont think id go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself
im careful
gee-
thats the worst neighborhood in the whole area
yeah
its a little scary sometimes
and i manage the
credit cards
yeah
ill tell you what i cant say a whole lot about credit cards because i tore mine up
is that right
i know some other people that have done that
yeah
i got in some financial problems because of credit cards
so i basically just got rid of all of them
i have a couple
i have a gas card that i use just for gas and $unc$one that i use just for emergencies
uh-huh
but
uh-huh
yeah
we have some friends that did exactly the same thing
they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed
and finally they realized that they were abusing them and werent going to get out of the hole
and they just cut them all up except for $unc$one they kept for emergencies
and theyre still paying away to get out of debt
yeah
i know it
but no
i did just the opposite
i guess i sort of followed in my parents footsteps
i have quite a few of them
i use them continually
uh-huh
but i basically never charge anything i dont have the money in the bank to pay for
and i always pay them off totally every month
is that right
yeah
thats a good policy
yeah
and theyre just a convenience for me
i dont have to get cash out of the bank
and i dont have to be writing checks
and
yeah
yeah
sometimes i wish i had them
but in most cases im glad i dont because unfortunately i dont have the control you have
uh-huh
i wish i did
but i dont
yeah
and it
i just dont want to get into that situation again
so well
uh-huh
yeah
its easy
you dont have anything transferring just a little signature
so what
thats it
and thats
even with my gas card i find that ill go in to get some gas
uh-huh
and ill end up buying candy and drinks and sweets and whatever
right
and then at the end of the month i get a bill
and im thinking what did i get that costs so much
surprising
yeah
and
but the
there are some inherent limits there
youre not going to run up a few $unc$thousand dollars for that
right
yeah
thats true
but i can certainly understand where
i
w-
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really not so much discipline
you have sort of a discipline in general about finances
but i hate their interest rates so badly that i
yeah
isnt it
thats unbelievable
how
let me ask you this
how old are you
im $unc$thirty-three
$unc$thirty-three
$unc$thirty-two
excuse me
okay
youll be $unc$thirty-three this year
yeah
you want to be $unc$thirty-two as long as you can
its coming
uh-huh
yeah
i know what you mean about the interest rates its unbelievable
that just irritates me so much that i refuse to pay them interest
and my wife recently decided she had to go to $unc$brazil and was going to take off
and shes from there and didnt really have the money
uh-huh
but she could pay it off
and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards
but shes paying it
and i just wont do it
shes paying i dont know what per month $unc$forty $unc$fifty dollars per month in interest
jeez
and i just refuse to give it to them
if i need to borrow that kind of money ill go to the bank
and
yeah
and then you bet
thats
yeah
in fact ive even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their higher interest rate cards and just sent them back
income
yeah
right
right
yeah
and i guess theres some negotiating there too
because i heard
on $unc$one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and said what you can do is call
if youve got a pretty good credit rating you can call wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my annual fees or ill just go to somewhere else
uh-huh
right
high
i might
and if youve got a pretty good history with them theyre more than willing to do that
right
i might try that because i have $unc$one card that ive had for about i dont know $unc$nine or $unc$ten years
yeah
in fact thats what this guy
he wrote a book on it
and he says hes tried it with several of his cards
uh-huh
and hes just told them i can get this card from this bank at this rate
and yours is at $unc$eighteen or $unc$nineteen percent
right
it does not make sense for me to do that
and if you wont drop my rates ill just go ahead and send you back your card
and ill go somewhere else and get it
yeah
for me the big thing is the annual fee
and i just refuse
i wont get any card now
ive got a good rating
and ive got
uh-huh
and im not going to pay an annual fee
the only $unc$one i actually pay on is this $unc$one that the very first
hello
hello
hi
my name is $unc$dolphene
i live in $unc$texas
hi
my name is $unc$pat $unc$johnson
and i live in $unc$texas too
okay
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
do you also
no
okay
no
i live in $unc$dallas
i work for the $unc$dallas school system
okay
you ready to begin
we might as well
okay
okay
i understand we are doing care of the elderly right
yes
and how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home
i dont think that any of my relatives would really like to go there
i believe if i am in a position when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that i will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also or have someone go into their home and look them
uh-huh
that way
yes
i would find it very difficult to place my father or my step-mother in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it
uh-huh
right
its more how they feel about it
yes
and it is like they feel the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away
yes
i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to look for if you are faced with placing someone in a place like that aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such
right
uh-huh
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference
and i have a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who could care for her
uh-huh
and i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation
uh-huh
and another thing to think about on the positive side of the nursing homes here
i use to work in $unc$one of the offices in a nursing home
uh-huh
and i got to see a lot of the things that they did
uh-huh
they had a lot of crafts
yes
and they had a lot of games
and they get together and they do all sorts of things
and then there
some of the people that are in there are very nice and friendly to everybody
uh-huh
and then there are others that are
it is just a job
and they just want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home
yeah
uh-huh
the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important
uh-huh
i think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts because there are some who poor things dont have any real grasp on reality any longer
right
right
and they may be ambulatory
but they tend to behave like small children
yeah
and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasnt in that situation to have to deal with on a daily basis
yeah
it is like the $unc$one that i worked in you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day
they would just roll themselves around all over the place
and they would enjoy themselves with activities
yes
and then you would see some of the others that were distant from the other group
and they just didnt participate together with the others because they had some i guess slight mental disabilities and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
what do you call $unc$alzheimer disease and stuff like that
yes
$unc$alzheimer
yes
and they werent really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
yes
and that can
okay
how has it been this week for you
weather-wise or otherwise
weather-wise
weather-wise
damp cold warm
no
damp
we have gone through what might be called the $unc$four seasons in the last week
uh-huh
we have had highs of $unc$seventy-two lows in the twenties
my goodness
i dont even want to tell you what ours has been like then
it was $unc$ninety-six yesterday
i heard about that
and we set a record yesterday very windy
but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature very cool
i think right now its like $unc$sixty-nine
and thats cool for u-
or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant
no rain in the last month i dont think
the grounds very dry
and our yard work everything is in bloom
so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry
but i guess it also brings about allergies
were having a lot of allergies down here right now
uh-huh
everything blooming
and the weather
uh-huh
and i think a lot of people have contracted spring fever too
had a lot of people out at work for fishing and golfing reasons and things like that
the blue flu
yeah
yeah
the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess
yes
as ive said we have had variable weather
it has been untypically wet for this time of year
and also we have a lot of green
the grass has been growing
and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines
but fortunately it rains
and you do not have to go out and buy the spark plug
yeah
but weve had an unusually warm spring
and i guess were still in winter
and we have had no snow
uh-huh
no snow
to speak of
we usually average anywhere from $unc$six to $unc$twelve inches during the winter
and this year as well as last year we have had less than $unc$four inches total accumulation
so its been inordinately warm here for this time of year
so in that regard its fine
but i envy you your $unc$ninety-four degrees
uh-huh
i thought i heard this morning that in $unc$san $unc$antonio it was in the nineties yesterday
yes
yes
it is
down in the more southern and western areas
and of course we are about $unc$two hours from the northern border straight south
yeah
and very windy
its amazing to me
because i have only lived in $unc$dallas for $unc$three years
and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time
it does
i
very seldom if any
i cant remember a day that i walked out and the wind wasnt blowing
uh-huh
i spent $unc$six years in graduate school in $unc$indiana in the flatlands
and it was that way every day
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty miles an hour summer and winter
so that
you became accustomed to it i guess
uh-huh
but otherwise as i said we have had a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country
uh-huh
where did you go to school in $unc$indiana
$unc$purdue
$unc$purdue
i have a brother that lives in $unc$south $unc$bend $unc$indiana
yes
and i had to always
ive lived there for $unc$eight years myself
id always said i was going to go back to school and go to $unc$notre $unc$dame
but i didnt
you are not from that area originally i can tell
no
originally im from $unc$new $unc$mexico
okay
i was born in $unc$new $unc$mexico
and we lived in $unc$south $unc$bend for $unc$eight years and then moved to $unc$tennessee
uh-huh
and
i thought i heard a little $unc$tennessee in there somewhere
very much
very much
cause i spent $unc$thirteen years there and then moved to $unc$dallas about $unc$three years ago
uh-huh
so
gee
youve moved around as much as i have
yeah
my father was in the $unc$air $unc$force
so
i see
uh-huh
i worked for the government
so i moved much more frequently than i had intended for $unc$sixteen years
uh-huh
but i guess this is my first conversation in this series
uh-huh
i received a call last night because of the
i had not received my personal identification number
right
so i had to call $unc$jack $unc$godfrey today to ask him what it was because i had to abort the call last evening because i couldnt get on the line
yeah
is there any
im not sure how long were supposed to talk
its just as long as you want to
its just as long as you want to just a reasonable lengthy conversation
do you work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
no
i do not
i work for $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e
okay
and i was sent an application from $unc$jack
uh-huh
ive known $unc$jack for some time
im in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years
okay
so i was very much interested in being a speaker for this
yeah
i work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
and im an environmental engineer
i see
and they just published this internally getting people involved
uh-huh
thats really strange
i was wondering why we had somebody from $unc$maryland though
i was saying god do we have a $unc$ti in $unc$maryland
or
im sure you have a representative somewhere in the area if just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative
uh-huh
but i have been a speaker in other similar type of activities
uh-huh
and i know the reason why this is being gathered and the program and so forth
so as i said i was interested in being a speaker
uh-huh
we havent talked much about the weather
i know thats what were supposed to do
yeah
yeah
really the letter just says
lets see i cant
i was looking at it
i was trying to find out speedy short cuts
and i always thought its not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and end it when needed
so
uh-huh
in environmental engineering
uh-huh
is that with regard to work place engineering or just the work place environment
or
its actually waste water
i see
taking care of
im actually in the air division
and we monitor anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building
or we do have customers that their concerns are in the work place
and we take care of that
but within our department we take care of everything waste water solid waste and recycling and air and
uh-huh
i had
the call last evening was supposed to be concerning recycling in the community
uh-huh
the call i received
and so i had thought a little bit about it before hand
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i
but thats interesting
i have a friend who is a planner a city planner
uh-huh
and $unc$one of his
and he models city districts and so forth does computer modeling
uh-huh
yeah
and $unc$one of the
he gets inputs from an environmental engineer
uh-huh
yeah
our division is corporate wide
and we take care of just the $unc$dallas area
uh-huh
of course we have several plants here
but we do air modeling also
i see
and i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the $unc$dallas area
what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information temperature wind speed wind direction
and we have a huge chemical data base
thats interesting
and our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site
and its concentration
and if anything ever happened $unc$god forbid a building explosion or something wed be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
okay the first thing
what do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school
first i think theyve got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do
uh-huh
once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
yeah
do you feel that the
depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to that school all $unc$four years
but i know there are some fields where its really not necessary
yeah
a lot fields are
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff arent really concerned with your first $unc$two years anyway
its your core education your general education requirements
uh-huh
if they want to get a liberal arts degree i dont know what advice id give them
go to the school youd like to go to
yeah
thats what i did
yeah
i didnt care about the program or anything else
i went where i wanted to go
yeah
what was your degree in
political science
political science
okay
i know im going to school right now
and i have a friend
where are you at
$unc$u $unc$t $unc$d
$unc$university of $unc$texas $unc$dallas
yeah
i guess everybodys in $unc$dallas that i talk to
im in $unc$north $unc$carolina
i know
thats where $unc$texas $unc$instruments is
yeah
right
something i think that ive noticed that
i have a friend
i think if youre going into law or medicine a very particular very specific field even engineering you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution
sure
and its a lot cheaper
yeah
my parents made a mistake in sending my sister to a private institution for the first $unc$two years
and she found out after that
she said my parents they really wasted a lot of money
this is about $unc$twenty years ago
uh-huh
but right now i just
as far as selecting a school i feel that a lot of it depends upon the major
yeah
it does
i didnt know what i wanted to do after i got my degree
uh-huh
originally i had planned undergrad degree in political science and then a masters in public administration
and i went ahead and pursued that
i got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it
i didnt want it
and from that point i went to law school
uh-huh
and after a year and a half of that i decided i didnt want that either
okay
havent figured out what i want to be when i grow up
yeah
but i really did enjoy the law
thats where i wanted to be
but i didnt want to go through the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney
i just wanted a law degree
uh-huh
and ive since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because thats the nuts and bolts of the law and thats what i like
yeah
and you dont have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to
right
so thats what im pursuing right now
and im pretty happy with it so far
yeah
yeah
im pursuing whats called an interdisciplinary field
im a speech therapy major
uh-huh
and fortunately i have a good medical background
yeah
and
thats probably very useful
yeah
its actually turning out to be more useful than what i thought
uh-huh
and i also have a good languages background linguistics and some psychology
uh-huh
its all working together
yeah
the only field im not familiar with really is education which requires about $unc$four or $unc$five different fields really
good grief
so its a
yeah
i thought at $unc$one time i wanted to be a teacher
but i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet
uh-huh
i said i couldnt do this everyday
no way
maybe being a tenured professor would be $unc$one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
you are a disgruntled graduate student
i am just a disgruntled person all around
im the original $unc$mister $unc$scrooge i guess
yeah
bah humbug
yeah
bah humbug
yeah
i just
i think
yeah
there is
i think law would be a fine profession fine field to go into
i know $unc$one time i was in a political science class
and talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable
and that was like a can of worms
you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
no
there was a woman
she said my best friends are lawyers and all this
and it was just
that remark in itself is a slam
my best friends are lawyers
yeah
i know
my best friends are blacks
or $unc$jewish
it used to be $unc$jewish
$unc$jewish
now blacks
yeah
and i guess $unc$iraqi now is the
i know
its
but
law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
yeah
and it doesnt become fun anymore
yeah
i have a friend
shes going into law
another friend going into law
and shes
im really concerned about
shes just going to be
whats going to happen when she gets there
yeah
you going
all of her dreams will be dispelled
yeah
yeah
if youve ever seen the program paper chase its very much like that except worse
yeah
yeah
i think its probably more embarrassing and very painful
it is
i see that happening
yeah
very much so
yeah
its a lot of that
yeah
it was enjoyable for a while
but its such a grind
yeah
and you begin to wonder
if im not
you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it
uh-huh
if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it
uh-huh
i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard
and i aged $unc$ten years
uh-huh
but i wouldnt trade the experience for anything in the world
it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law
yeah
i went to a language school
and it was an i guess $unc$united $unc$states institution
i was military at the time
and i think probably the biggest
what branch were you in
what branch were you in
i was in the $unc$air $unc$force
i was too
yeah
yeah
for myself i think that military experience was fine
i just wish that there was something else that i could have done with
i got tired of the service after a while
it
i had a terrific job really enjoyed it
yeah
what was your job
command post
i was a linguist
i was just wondering were you in $unc$sac by any chance
were you in $unc$sac
in $unc$tak
$unc$sac
no
i wasnt
okay
i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the r c one thirty-fives
no
no
i didnt go flight crew
matter of fact i didnt make it completely through that field
i was in intelligence school and about $unc$three weeks short
i didnt make it
i sort of washed out
yeah
after about $unc$eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training its something
uh-huh
i think thats why children really need to think about the field theyre going into and spend a lot of serious reading not just thinking about
yeah
yeah
they actually should do some reading
thats right
and if its possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it
and they should study it
yeah
i think theres a lot to be said for kids working after school
uh-huh
sure
they find out just how much of a people person they are
thats true
i found that out when i was in high school
i worked at mcdonalds
and i tell you what
i worked at mcdonalds as well
and i can tell you $unc$one thing
there are just some people that i
you just came to the point where
and i eventually worked as a lab technician
and i worked front desk
and somebody could walk in the door
and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say
yeah
yeah
i was the same way too
im not a people person
i hate having to play such a nice guy especially when its all phony especially when you got some jerk coming in
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i
its just not for me
i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why im going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
uh-huh
yeah
thats good
i was just wondering getting back to the school thing i almost wish that there was something
what kind of a car do you drive now
i drive a $unc$honda $unc$prelude
do you
i drive a $unc$honda $unc$accord
yeah
yeah
i bought mine a year ago
so im not buying a car any time soon
yeah
me either
i just bought mine
it will be a year in $unc$august
yeah
i love it though
i love $unc$hondas
yeah
it
i think i found my car
i like where all the controls theyre in good spots
right
really
yeah
i have a standard
but
i
an its supposedly real reliable
the only thing ive ever heard about $unc$hondas is that the breaks go out first
really
yeah
i hadnt heard that
yeah
what did you have before you bought that
i had a $unc$buick $unc$regal
did you
yeah
i had a $unc$mazda $unc$r $unc$x $unc$seven before that
and that was the worse car ive ever driven in my life
the $unc$buick was great
it was $unc$nine years old
and it was still going strong
really
the only problems i had with it in the $unc$nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about $unc$seven years old
really
and that was the only major problem that i had
i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler
yeah
and i had replaced the tires
and seems like it had a radiator leak once
but i never had any major anything other than the compressor
right
i really never had anything major with my $unc$mazda
but it was a standard also
and the clutch went out on it toward the end
i had it $unc$five years
and the last $unc$two years it seemed to go out really easily
i think it went out twice in $unc$two years
and thats a lot
it shouldnt go out that much
huh-uh
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the $unc$honda
but i dont think im going to do that again
i think im going back to automatic now
i never
i kind of know how to drive standard
but ive never owned $unc$one
so i dont drive $unc$one a lot
right
i dont feel comfortable in traffic with it
right
and for everything ive heard its a lot easier to sell an automatic
yeah
it is
and resale value is really important to me
thats true
yeah
it is me too
thats why i got the $unc$honda
yeah
$unc$hondas have great resale value
yeah
the $unc$mazda definitely did not
not at all
theyre worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes
i did pretty well with my $unc$regal because it was in really good shape
but it still looked real nice
yeah
the interior was still really nice
there wasnt cracks all over the dash board and stuff
right
and it had some nice features
so i ended up okay with the $unc$buick
good
and i anticipate the same thing with the $unc$honda whenever i decide to sell it
of course i may never sell it
right
i may drive it until its dead
but
yeah
thats what i did with the $unc$mazda drive it until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off
yeah
probably what ill do again
yeah
but i really like the $unc$hondas
i like foreign cars a lot
uh-huh
i looked at the $unc$mitsubishi $unc$galant
i was looking for a $unc$four door car having driven the $unc$r $unc$x $unc$seven so long
uh-huh
and it was so small
and its really impractical
so i wanted something with a real trunk and $unc$four doors something easy to get in and out of
and i looked at the $unc$galant
and those were really nice
and i can get them for a great price
yeah
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through
oh
thats how i ended up with a $unc$honda
i wasnt even looking for a car when i bought this car
i was thinking about buying a $unc$prelude from a friend who was moving to $unc$new $unc$york or something
and she was going to sell her car because she didnt need it anymore
and it was only like a year old
and i had never driven a $unc$prelude
so i went to a dealership because they had the same year and same model of $unc$prelude on their used car lot
right
and i went and i test drove it
and i just fell in love with this brand new white $unc$prelude $unc$two liter $unc$s $unc$i with the sun roof and the moon roof
yeah
theyre nice i think
and i bought it loaded
yeah
yeah
i have to have them loaded
i love all those little things that you dont need
but theyre so wonderful
yeah
i went there looking at a used car
and $unc$two days later i bought this car
i felt like that was largest impulse that i had ever made
the $unc$two other things that i bought on impulse are a v c r and a washer and dryer
i understand
i go for the big stuff
yeah
i noticed
mine was definitely not impulse
i really needed a new car
mine was just it was getting worn out i guess from being a sports car
i drove it kind of hard
oh
and i got it right after high school
so by the time i traded it in it was ready
yeah
i got my $unc$buick as a high school graduation gift
did you
yeah
but i guess this wasnt really an impulse
buying it right then and right quickly was kind of impulsive
but id been thinking about buying a new car for about $unc$three years
and i was just scared to
right
i was scared to start taking on payments because the $unc$buick was long since paid for
right
thats the same with me
would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself
buy a used car
right
sure
i was going to buy $unc$one once
but i worry about whos driven them and what theyve been through and the warranties and things like that
yeah
just i cant seem to get over that
that just bothers me
i dont know why
like on $unc$hondas they
supposedly the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with $unc$honda or whatever
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff
yeah
thats true
they cant stop you from doing it
hoping that they do go to a $unc$honda dealership to get them serviced
yeah
yeah
and even if they didnt you can still get a good idea if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the block and everything
yeah
thats true
i guess thats all
okay
i enjoyed talking to you
i enjoyed talking to you
bye-bye
bye-bye
what are your first comments on that subject
my first comments on the budget
i would say there has
what would you start cutting f-
what would be the first thing youd cut
defense
surprisingly no
i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support
mean private enterprise
have private enterprise do it
you mean the prisons
uh-huh
theyre already talking about it
theyre talking about having it as a business so the government doesnt have to deal with it
i hadnt heard that
but yeah
because i think its all either state or federally funded
or obviously
right
but theres not enough room in these prisons and that to continue funding it
but to me it
they think they need to maybe have private enterprise come in
so
the other way im thinking about is they should be self-supporting like the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves
in other words theyre in there for a purpose
put them to work rather than sitting there
uh-huh
its the same thing like the whole i shouldnt say criminal but the whole police department of the $unc$united $unc$states
i feel the same way
someone gets picked up for drunk driving
he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there
uh-huh
so its self-defense on that point
as far as my defense budget theyre cutting it back now what $unc$twenty-five percent
i wouldnt want to see it cut any more than that
yeah
but again id like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today
so im lost on that $unc$one
i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what weve got
uh-huh
yeah
its tough to say what
as far as this that good or bad or what
but i was just talking to somebody else
and all those european countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that
they
not so much pay
im not trying to see the government put out any more
no
yeah
i know what you are saying
but im just saying that even the differences is that some countries pay for students to go through college and $unc$etcetera
but here its just up to high school
yeah
but we dont even push the fact to the high school kids that theres other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they do in other countries just doing it which i think would bring the education back up
uh-huh
why not apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or just a technician
you can learn on the job of course which would mean
uh-huh
our education budget will go down if this is
in a few years its not going to be overnight
yeah
but that would come down
i think thats $unc$one reason we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board
theyre not willing to put the training for only a certain amount
so its as far as the technical side
but even
$unc$one of the biggest things now is paralegals and stuff
theyre trying to get more people into that field
but they cant just bring somebody in without even having gone to school in that area before they can work for a lawyer as a paralegal
i see it being done
i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever
and shes training her
uh-huh
yeah
im assuming that it can be done
my perspective is that ive been with a couple of big companies now
and its like theyd are unwilling to put the time in
they want somebody when they bring them in that they have a certain amount to contribute
obviously theres a lot to learn after that
but thats true
im sure theres a lot of
businesses are small businesses that could
let me change my channel
ive got a cordless phone
let me see if that clears this up
is that better
yes
okay
wow!
yeah
it was a cordless phone
and all of a sudden we had a bad frequency there or something
so we had some interference
so i changed that
yeah
it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
but i think maybe they need to help promote that more give incentives like if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is for them to train people stuff like that programs like that
uh-huh
i dont know what kind of options theyve got
thats something about what germanys supposed to be doing something similar to that right now
and they have jobs out on bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields
but that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at high school level which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
uh-huh
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around because they dont have any education
uh-huh
i dont mean college
and im for college
but theres a lot of people that dont want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned
theyve had it
yeah
i think i just heard something the other day
it was either $unc$sixty percent or $unc$forty percent go to college
and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree
uh-huh
i thought that was interesting
but most people i knew have gone and got their degree
so
yeah
but theres a lot of them out there that havent
yeah
i was basic in a upper middle class area
thats
and yeah
i think that demographic area there a lot of them do go on
and they go to college $unc$etcetera
because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money
and if they enjoy it more theyll make a happier life for themselves
yeah
question
you threw that question on me about the deficit
put it on your shoe now
what would you do
as far as the deficit thats a whole nother my perception of the budget the government
and they have so much to spend
and theres not enough money to spread around
but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money going out and too many goods coming into this country
and part of that problem i think is still
$unc$japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country
and obviously the demand for their goods is quite high here
so they can get their goods in here
and to start even that out we need to continue to at least threaten that
were going to give them higher tariffs $unc$etcetera to raise their prices to ours
but its just that theyre
i think youre going to find that just because the $unc$united $unc$states there is such a demand here the market
and the money being spent and the goods flow in and we dont sell products abroad as much as we bring in
so
were you watching
i think
$unc$one of the news stations i couldnt even tell you which $unc$one i watched but they had on there where the output from the $unc$united $unc$states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
uh-huh
okay
what kind of puppy you got
i think shes mostly $unc$german $unc$shepherd
she was
a person lives across the street from me brought her home from work because a coworker of hers had this dog appear on its front doorstep
somebody abandoned her
and shes only $unc$six to $unc$eight weeks old
uh-huh
and i cant understand why anyone would abandon this dog though
oh
shes this young
and shes almost housebroken
wow
she actually asks to go out
thats great
and yeah
i was amazed
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality
i dont know
i cant imagine what would have been wrong with this dog
so
yeah
i have a dog that $unc$god gave us too
uh-huh
yeah
she just appeared
really
yeah
my husband calls her street dog
but weve had her now for about $unc$three years
uh-huh
and i just
you get so attached to them
yeah
i had a
last year i had another $unc$german $unc$shepherd
this $unc$one was purebred
and when he was about $unc$seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on deaths door
but managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
uh-huh
and on huge doses of antibiotics he actually got over it with $unc$seven $unc$hundred dollars in vet bills
wow
but he actually was able to get him over that
uh-huh
and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy
and he put on about $unc$fifteen to $unc$twenty pounds after the thing
and then he got hit by a $unc$cadillac
no
so i couldnt believe it
that was really hard
gee
and that was even harder for
i was on a business trip at the time
and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
uh-huh
so they just felt absolutely awful
i bet
and i felt probably worse for them than for me
because gosh this fellows wife who was watching the dog i think she loved that dog more than i did
and she was really attached to it
gosh
but its unfortunate
but now ive got another $unc$one
so
yeah
yeah
how long has it been since the first $unc$one
it was just over a year
yeah
it was in $unc$march of last year
so yeah
didnt have $unc$one for a whole year
yeah
i had a $unc$german $unc$shepherd before this one
and when she died it just absolutely destroyed me
i was just
yeah
i couldnt even talk about it for months
and so i decided it
im not going to do this anymore
right
and then $unc$god gave me this dog
so
my dads like that
he had a beagle that he loved
and when that beagle passed away he wasnt going to have another dog
theres no way
uh-huh
no
and then the beagle died in i guess about $unc$october
and by $unc$christmas time we went down to the i gue- $unc$humane $unc$society and got another one a stray
yeah
and she turned out to be a great dog
and we had her for $unc$six years until she just passed away recently
and again dad went through the whole thing
but mom went an
okay
yeah
you just do
yeah
you cant help
its like a kid
yeah
it is
hopefully this $unc$one here $unc$cocoa will live a full life
yeah
when
my doggie that we have now shes mostly $unc$golden $unc$retriever
uh-huh
the vet called her a golden mix
yeah
who knows
right
but shes that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color
oh
and her nose is that pink
uh-huh
she doesnt have a brown nose
and shes sort of unicolor eyes are the same color and everything
yeah
so i named her $unc$rosebud
and a friend of mine said that she gre-
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had a pet cow named $unc$rosebud
and she said theres a lot of longevity in that name
said my cow lived $unc$seventeen years
thats not too bad
$unc$golly the golden retrievers are good dogs too
theyre kind of like get that permanent smile to them
yeah
right
theyre always happy
i dont think ive ever seen them not look happy
and shes so easy going and so sociable
yeah
she loves everybody
and little kids can just maul all over her
right
and she just thinks its great
this friend of mine has th-
its the same guy that was watching my $unc$german $unc$shepherd when he got hit
but went fishing with him on $unc$friday and took
hes got a pure bred $unc$golden $unc$retriever
and then i had the puppy a little tiny puppy
and we went and took the $unc$two dogs up fishing
and this
they had a ball romping around
uh-huh
and you cant get a $unc$golden $unc$retriever near water without it jumping in
getting in
yeah
and this $unc$golden $unc$retriever jumped in the really fast moving river current
and
no
no
actually he had no trouble at all
he first jumped in
and i
hes just about a year old himself and never had really
i dont think hed swum before
really
but he jumped in the river
did puppy go to
the puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the
i was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water
thats good
yeah
cause if she fell in then id had to go in after her
and up here the waters probably about $unc$forty degrees right now
ugh
ugh
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her
but this dog $unc$dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as hes floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and actually paddled up against the current and made it back to the shore and climbed up
and then he jumped in again
and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon
he loved it
yeah
$unc$cocoa didnt think too much of it though
she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out
i pulled her out and then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
yeah
but she got over it
so
the $unc$german $unc$shepherd that i had before
we had a little pool
uh-huh
and she did not want any part of swimming
but she liked to get in the pool on the first step
shed just get on the first step and lay down in the summertime when its really really hot
uh-huh
yeah
and shed just lay there on that step and just cool off
yeah
i live right across the street from a big lake here
its on $unc$oneida lake
and im wondering if shell want to go out there and go swimming next year
ive got
the yards all fenced in
so she doesnt run loose
but she could go in sometime if im watching her
uh-huh
so
yeah
the one that we had just didnt want any part of that
really
yeah
and she
baths
gee she hated baths worse than anything
it was just really a fight to get her clean
yeah
have you seen canine the movie
no
no
youve got to see it especially since you have a $unc$german
it is so cute
really
yeah
an part of the movie is where hes trying to clean this dog up
and its just hysterical
okay
my dog last $unc$german $unc$shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too
and that was the thing i couldnt figure out
because he would go in the lake
it wasnt like he didnt
uh-huh
i-
normally he didnt seem to have a problem with getting wet
but if you wanted to get him wet forget it
yeah
thats how $unc$cleo w-
shed lay on her step
yeah
but that was the only time she wanted to get wet
and she didnt want you getting her wet
right
right
obstinate
obstinate
yeah
but you really need to see that movie
we bought the movie
and i dont know how many times ive seen it
uh-huh
and it came on t v the other night
and i was watching it again
and my husband heard me laughing
and he said i cant believe that youre still getting such a kick out of that movie
ill have to check it out
i saw the previews for it and all
and it did look like itd be a good movie
but
it is great
really havent had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately
yeah
but i got to do more fun things
we always wait until we can rent them
yeah
yeah
im a second lieutenant in the $unc$air $unc$force
and so i travel a lot
really
and yeah
im a engineer at the $unc$rolm $unc$laboratory $unc$griffis $unc$air $unc$force $unc$base up here
so
oh
thats how i got into the switchboard project and all that
so
uh-huh
but its nice having a dog here
the
yeah
theres just
un-
whats the word im looking for lots of affection unconditional affection from the dog
right
thats it
yeah
yeah
really
not critical at all
no
no
yeah
theyre really wonderful
yeah
its been nice talking to you
we seem to be degenerating here
so
i dont have strong feelings about changes to be made in the jury system do you
not at all
in fact im graduating from college in about a week
and this past semester ive taken $unc$two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials
then you must know a lot more about this than i do
i think the system right now is fine
i think it should be by a jury
i dont think the judge should have
hes just there kind of like the referee
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont even think that it should be unanimous either
what about the idea that $unc$one is only guilty when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
i thought that was the point of a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldnt be any reasonable doubt
uh-huh
right
but if there are some people who dont agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
exactly
uh-huh
i dont know
i
you hear of course theres cases where someone has been put in prison falsely accused
but more than likely the people that are on the jury know what theyre doing
you
really
have you served on a jury
never
i never have either
but my few friends who have say just the opposite
they say theyre remarkably incompetent and dont know what theyre doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air and all that
you would think that they would get that in the
when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out
and i know they automatically
when youre chosen is youre automatically like a professor in criminal justice or something like that
that youre automatically
no
they dont want you on the jury
right
they dont want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system
exactly
uh-huh
exactly
and they tend
and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they dont want to do it
anyone can get out of jury just about
so its not really my peers that
lets say i were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury i wouldnt feel that i would be being tried by a jury of my peers
uh-huh
id be tried by a jury of people who had nothing else to do and werent very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things
and i dont know
uh-huh
i get a little bit nervous about it
and
ive never even been called to jury duty
yeah
i was called once
but i was out of the country
and apparently they thought i served
so i didnt make any noise about it
i came back
and they said the record showed i served
but i was out of the country at the time
so im pretty sure i didnt
yeah
i dont know
i guess theres a lot of problems with the legal system
yeah
i dont know
i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous
because theres the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat the jury a majority of the jury
uh-huh
thats hard to say
so its saying look we dont like the way he looks
and lets throw the rascal in jail and stuff
right
and you also get a lot of juries are extremely
and from what i hear
i have some friends who do expert witness testimony
and they say that juries are extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches
the prosecutor will want to i dont know show the mugging victim show the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim
or if its a corporation that was harming some individual or something like that they get very much
its just a big faceless corporation
lets make them pay as much as possible things like that
uh-huh
not
im
the problem is i cant guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury
but id be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be things like that
ri-
i dont think the judge should just make the decision alone
yeah
least with the jury you have $unc$twelve people that are going to decide
uh-huh
how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow
i wonder if thats possible
i guess the judges time is worth too much though
exac-
judge
they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
right
exactly
he makes more money in an hour than all $unc$twelve of them put together
probably
yeah
yeah
but no
its sad though the people though that
somebodys life is in $unc$twelve peoples hands
and sometimes those $unc$twelve people could care less
uh-huh
uh-huh
or they fool the defense in thinking that theyre
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want
of course
its political maneuvering
the $unc$one side is looking for someone whose face they think will want to hang everyone
and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic
theyre not looking for someone whos going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror
neither side wants that
they want to find a juror thats going to be most persuadable by their arguments
exactly
i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually
i know its tricky
because i know an awful lot of intelligent people who just
im too busy to serve on a jury
uh-huh
so ill tell them that
and they just answer $unc$one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that
yeah
they just say do you believe in such and such
i guess its just that maybe people are upset at court
if it was a family member of theirs though that was innocent
and then theyd want to be on that jury
right
course they would be barred
but
but i think if everyone took it seriously
uh-huh
yeah
it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury
yeah
i hope were called up before too long
i would love to be called
im ready to go
they just havent called me up yet
they will eventually
okay
it was nice talking with you
it was nice talking to you
bye-bye
bye-bye
all right
have you ever been drug tested
thats a good question
i had a job i had to go get a blood test for
uh-huh
and they did a full blood screen on me
but they didnt call that a drug test
tha-
i think they checked for drugs
they just dont tell you they did
yeah
ive had $unc$two or $unc$three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at different jobs
uh-huh
i had $unc$one at $unc$t $unc$i and then $unc$one at another engineering company
and really i dont mind them
i dont do drugs anyway
i guess if i did maybe i would
but i dont know
i know a girl that shes a nurse
and they get drug tested randomly
ive never been randomly drug tested
uh-huh
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that youre going to be drug tested and you didnt know about it
yeah
i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
yeah
i guess so
i guess so
do you think that its right
i come from kind of a biased opinion because im a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
uh-huh
and ive done employee assistant work
and i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related
right
right
and its in the billions of dollars every year
and the only way that they can prevent that is making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free
thats true
and the problem in the work place is that people are
if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever you can come to work drunk and get in an accident
and hell cover up for you
and nobody knows about it
right
but ends up costing the company lots and lots of money
thats true
i believe its right especially for certain jobs
i think anyone in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that
uh-huh
i think they should be randomly drug tested
yeah
i believe full force in that
yeah
i dont know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be
true
secretaries arent really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something
so i dont know
im kind of biased too because i dont do drugs
and so i really dont care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about
uh-huh
yeah
so i guess thats kind of biased
yeah
there
i think $unc$one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
yeah
it does
because generally you know it
you find out one way or another if somebodys got a problem on the job
yeah
thats true
and like you say even if its just the secretary
if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then its still a problem
yeah
thats true
but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party $unc$three days before
and its been the whole weekend since theyve done anything
and they happen to be tested $unc$monday morning
and they could be fired for that
thats kind of unfair also
yeah
i guess it comes with the turf
yeah
i guess so
i guess if youre going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
yeah
man
and in terms of drugs theyre illegal
so youre breaking the law anyway
thats true
thats true
probably the biggest problem with those is they dont do a real good job of assessing for alcohol
thats true
and thats probably the biggest problem there is
yeah
i think so more than drugs
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
yeah
they would pay for an alcohol
uh-huh
but they dont always pay for drug rehabilitation
i guess thats $unc$one of the positive things that have come out of it some of the employee assistance program
if you do test positive for something they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
yeah
thats true
and i
i think thats fair
th-
yeah
i think the company benefits in the long run
yeah
thats true
thats about all i have to say on it
what kind of testing do they do when you went
its a urine test
urine screen
and they
yeah
it was really very official
you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours
and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that
uh-huh
so that theyre sure that you havent borrowed anybodys i guess or something
that happens
yeah
i know
its hard to believe
it happens a lot
but i guess it does
there are people that pay other people to help them out
i know
im amazed at the things people will do
yeah
it is amazing
i guess there are people that do that
and those are expensive tests
im glad i never had to pay for $unc$one
yeah
yeah
it depends really on how strong a test it is
theyve got different degrees as far as how far back they can check
yeah
i guess so
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests
theyve some companies that are doing hair tests
really
yeah
that
theyll pull out $unc$one of your hairs
and they can apparently test back a certain period of time because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles
how weird
i didnt know that
its kind of
thats weird
hair follicles i guess are just dead protein
and they
yeah
and its apparently almost like a calendar
theyve got it pretty precise now
they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and that type of thing
thats wild
its amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body
yeah
so i guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
yeah
thats true
thats true
im glad i never had to do it by giving blood
i cant stand the thought of giving blood
uh-huh
i cant even do it for $unc$wadley even though its a good cause
yeah
i enjoyed talking to you
i did too
thank you
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
okay
tell me about $unc$china cry
okay
$unc$china cry was basically the true story written by this lady who was a native $unc$chinese who was raised by $unc$christian parents
uh-huh
and her time frame was prior to the $unc$nineteen $unc$forty-nine revolution
i see
although she herself had never really accepted $unc$jesus or gone through any of the other christian portions of the faith repentance baptisms $unc$et $unc$cetera $unc$et $unc$cetera she had always felt a very strong leaning in this direction
and whenever the cultural revolution of $unc$nineteen $unc$forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or all the clergy and so forth were killed or imprisoned and the property confiscated she was safe because she had not officially joined the christian movement
uh-huh
as she grew up towards maturity her parents
her dad was a doctor
and he was rather well to do in the old regime
and the communist $unc$chinese didnt like this at all
the bourgeoisie was out of style then
right
everybody was back to a commonality of $unc$one
and so they kept picking at him picking at her mother and finally started picking on her and getting her to
uh-huh
they were starting to accuse her of crimes and atrocities before the revolution and had her write her own story over and over and over
and the major point of the movie was that she had married this chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court
i think im leaving out a portion
she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had gotten a job as an instructor
and they were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers when they decided that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre regime crimes as it were
uh-huh
uh-huh
being a child
they kept on and on at her
and in the meantime she and her husband were expecting their own child
and the people kept harassing her over a period of months
and finally they carried her out into the courtyard either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of shooting her executing her by firing squad
uh-huh
and the $unc$lord just said no
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really
shes $unc$one of mine
she is not going to die
and the soldiers were blinded when they shot
and her life was spared
and this frightened the commandant
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
and course heres this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
she put in for going to
and her husband had escaped to $unc$hong $unc$kong
and then she put in to go see him
and over time she
finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the middle bureaucracy that they finally let her go
and of course she had to walk
they stripped her of everything practically besides the clothes on her back
so she went across the border to her husband and other child that theyd already had to freedom
uh-huh
oh
and they knew that she wasnt going to come back
but she did years later when the liberalization of $unc$china happened
uh-huh
and she was not persecuted or anything else like that
interesting story
yes
it was
very moving too
i dont even remember seeing that advertised
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
it was within $unc$ninety days
that recent
yeah
no
it was advertised over a period of about $unc$ninety days
i see what you mean
but it wasnt
they didnt have it in too awfully many movie houses
but it was in the
it had large press release
uh-huh
i guess what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago so id remember it well was sort of light by comparison
okay
uh-huh
my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy
and we ended up going to see green card
green card
green card
uh-huh
and he chose it
and its got this wonderful french actor whos
it was his
and hes been a star in $unc$france and a wonderful actor who weve enjoyed for years
but hes never made an american film
this was his american film debut
i see
uh-huh
and he speaks very broken $unc$english
and basically he played a $unc$frenchman who married an american girl in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
and because she could claim she was married she could get an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in $unc$new $unc$york that had an outside garden which is very unusual there
uh-huh
so she was a horticulturist
and that was sort of her dream
i see
uh-huh
of course they got married
and they never saw each other again
except fate through them together
and the $unc$immigration and $unc$naturalization $unc$service started investigating
so they had to get back together and get their stories straight
and she was a very svelte sophisticated urban $unc$new $unc$yorker
and he was a poor $unc$frenchman who had grown up on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
uh-huh
hed been working in a restaurant when they met
uh-huh
and they had to learn all about each other basically in a weekend
just then
and it was
you knew what was going to happen of course that they would fall in love
uh-huh
they fell into like at any rate
and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever they did perfectly
right
uh-huh
and then he said something because his $unc$english was so poor for the most part
he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that on the last one he said i never remember that answer
and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
uh-huh
uh-huh
so
okay
okay
did you go to college
yes
i did
and where did you go
i went to a small liberal arts college in $unc$virginia
uh-huh
it was $unc$sweeper $unc$college of about $unc$seven $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty students
i had gone to a small school growing up
and a lot of my friends went to $unc$university of $unc$michigan
but my parents were retiring in $unc$south $unc$carolina when i graduated and were looking for a southern school and also $unc$u of $unc$m seemed overwhelming in size
uh-huh
and what about you
i went to the $unc$university of $unc$minnesota
youre from the $unc$midwest too
i am
uh-huh
where do you live now
i live in $unc$texas now
where are you
im in $unc$texas
im in $unc$austin
my brothers in $unc$austin
he lives $unc$lakeway
he had moved
were in $unc$plano
uh-huh
and
im familiar with $unc$plano
i visited once or twice
$unc$austin is so pretty
i really like it
i love it
i love it
i really do
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore
thats correct
i have $unc$two daughters
but my oldest will be a sophomore
because you live in $unc$austin is she thinking about the $unc$university of $unc$texas
she has her heart set on $unc$u $unc$t
and having gone to the $unc$university of $unc$minnesota i know what a big university is like
and $unc$one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band
and $unc$baylor has a band camp
oh
so she went for a week
and it was overnight
and they lived in the dorms
and i thought this would expose both of them to what its like on a smaller college campus
and my oldest $unc$one just wasnt impressed at all with the idea of a small school
so i still think the exposure was good
yes
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought
what were your selection criteria
did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford
or theres all of these areas to look at in making the decision
uh-huh
and those were several that we did consider
my parents certainly didnt push but wanted me to look in the south
and because i had been in a small school they suggested that probably i
when i say small my graduating class had $unc$eighteen in it
wow
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one small group situations
definitely
and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology
and i also wanted to spend $unc$one year studying in $unc$europe
uh-huh
i had had an $unc$a $unc$f $unc$s student from $unc$germany live with us our senior year
how exciting
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
and i ended up majoring in $unc$french
$unc$one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department
they also had a strong language department
and id always loved working with children
and i found that i couldnt fit everything in
but because i had had a fair amount of $unc$french going in i was able to do my years study in $unc$france and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me
uh-huh
and so that was some of
that worked out very well for you
but
several of the things you mentioned were the things that our son has talked a lot about $unc$texas $unc$a and $unc$m
but he thinks he wants to be a writer
and i dont think that
then he should come to $unc$u $unc$t
yes
and really his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of $unc$eight $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty to a $unc$thousand
uh-huh
and so hes used to a bigger size
large classes
because my brother he would have family close by
so there are advantages
but i also
because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to $unc$university of $unc$michigan which was so large
and they really felt like they were numbers
i went from a large high school to a large university
and i definitely felt like i was a number
you still
yeah
it is a different feeling
but that was my only option
i just really couldnt look at anything else
that was the $unc$one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior college which i didnt want to do
thats how my decision was made
but
thats certainly
especially today with the cost of college
that is a major consideration
and i do feel fortunate that $unc$texas has so many good schools
and even though $unc$baylor
yes
and when you mentioned that we have friends who have children there who just love it
and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are
and it is a smaller size
and i do feel like there are a lot of options
its
but i had been hoping some schools i know give
even this year $unc$jay had an aptitude test
what does
he hopes to be a writer
yes
he thinks thats what hed like to do
but hes really strong in math and science too
and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind
does your daughter know what shed like to do
she has interests that are just going in all directions
yeah
what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is
okay $unc$bethany lets be real
she really is pretty unfocussed at this point
and i dont know
shes taken a lot of $unc$french
and she may end up doing something with that
and i am a single mom
ive been
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married
so im trying to have my children not make the same mistake
and im showing them if youre strong in math and science kiddos this is $unc$one area where women can make some decent money
yes
im kind of really putting the practical application and saying yet do something that you enjoy
uh-huh
by all means go get that piece of paper
do you just have $unc$one son
yes
i see
it sounds like hes got some really good strong ideas of what he wants to do
but he has even
now that hes in high school
and of course there is still time
but hes beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it
its
okay
i guess were supposed to discuss the school system
that shouldnt be too much trouble for the $unc$two of us right
no
as many years as weve been involved in one
i really feel fortunate in that even though there are problems
theyre not a lot of problems where i teach
right
but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems with dropouts
when i was in $unc$minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that on a given day she didnt know how many of her students would show up
uh-huh
and sometimes they didnt even show up for class
and she taught in high school in inner city $unc$minneapolis
uh-huh
and they just didnt come to school
thats really sad isnt it
and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they dont even come to school
right
just recently in the paper here were articles about students working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades
uh-huh
but then the follow-up the next day was
i was kind of glad to see
because it said that
yes
but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that handling a job was very possible and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors
i think so too
what are their plans after high school
and whats their home situation
that
the home is the key
right right
i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education
and the main goal is making money now
and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand
right
sure
but there can still be an attitude of
right
this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now
but the most important thing is still getting your education
your education
when they said the topic of whats wrong with the public schools my first impulse was it isnt really whats wrong with the public schools
its whats wrong with families
thats right
its whats wrong with families
and if children come to school yes insecure and their biggest concern is survival both at home
right
they dont know what to expect at home
they dont feel secure there
they dont know whats going to happen just out front of their apartment complex
right
for example that child that was shot
right
how can they concentrate on schooling
i agree with you
right
i think thats the main problem
yeah
and schools now are supposed to solve social problems mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security
yeah
and thats overwhelming
at our school we have over a $unc$thousand elementary kids
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than $unc$one counselor
and thats just really not enough
no
it isnt
and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school
and they said we need more in the middle school because thats when kids are at a tougher and rougher age and all that
but part of my feeling is that if you help them to work through their problems while theyre littler then they wont have as many problems up there
true
i think there has to be at least a counselor
and we just recently had a counselor at elementary
we didnt even have counselors in elementary
really
we have always though had $unc$three at middle schools because we had about a $unc$thousand kids
and they divided them up between $unc$three counselors
but for a good while every year theyd have a different counselor
and they decided that didnt work
yeah
they started dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through all $unc$three years of middle school
uh-huh
they do that here
uh-huh
and i think that would give them more security in going to the counselor
uh-huh
if they have a rapport with their counselor
if they dont i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them
yeah
and occasionally that happens
right
but it is frightening
because education is the key to our future
yes
it certainly is
and if we have children who are not getting their education for $unc$one reason or another then what are we going to do with them
yeah
thats right
whats going to happen to them
are they going to be able to work at other kind of menial jobs
or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison
yeah
and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them
right
thats no good
im on that campus strategic planning committee for my school
uh-huh
and $unc$one of the
they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things
but anyway $unc$one of the key things was that we believed that the public education is the best economic value
then i think they decided to strike economic
uh-huh
anyway the point was what happens when public education fails
will then people go to private schools
uh-huh
what kind of a situation do they get there
and what are
and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools
i think $unc$one thing that well see is that we wont be educating everybody
right
there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they dont try to educate everyone
right
uh-huh
thats $unc$one of the things that we do
we try to educate everyone
thats right
thats right
were the only country in the world that does
uh-huh
uh-huh
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if theyre willing to work and have some ability
uh-huh
yeah
they can do that
and $unc$one of the $unc$plano school districts goals is that they will graduate every child that is here in the ninth grade
i believe its something like that
uh-huh
its worded
and i dont know
if we can keep them in school
right
uh-huh
thats so important
then that helps a lot
i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too
gosh
that new movie out
its scary to me
i
really a frightening situation
we are
i guess were both lucky to be in situations and schools where we dont see that
my folks talk about it a lot in $unc$illinois
my mother was teacher for years and years
and they live in $unc$peoria $unc$illinois
and theyre talking a lot about the school situation there too
shall we wrap it up
i would imagine that weve talked the amount of time necessary
i think we have to
okay
so ill see you when we see you
alright
we were in $unc$austin yesterday
uh-huh
the reason that i wasnt at church
and we went to hear $unc$james wind ensemble concert
oh
they left this morning for $unc$england
how exciting
isnt that wonderful
that is wonderful
uh-huh
what an experience
and the university
okay
hi $unc$nancy
h-
do you do a lot of dining out
no
we dont although we enjoy it
we do it more when we have company come
uh-huh
what about you
we do some dining out
i do a lot of cooking
so mostly when we go out its my husband and i
we dont go out too often as a family unless its a fast-food kind of thing
but we do enjoy dining out
$unc$one of our favorite places here in the $unc$dallas area is $unc$atlantic $unc$cafe
i dont know if you have you ever been there
ive heard of that
but i havent been there
where about is that
actually theres the $unc$atlantic $unc$cafe and $unc$cafe $unc$pacific and
okay
ive been to $unc$cafe $unc$pacific
have you
now thats down in $unc$highland $unc$park
right
its $unc$highland $unc$park $unc$village
did you like it
yes
i love it
before we moved to the area my brother lived in $unc$dallas for a number of years
and we came up $unc$one time when my father was visiting
and we all ate there
uh-huh
and their seafood was wonderful
its fabulous
it really is a great place
where is the $unc$atlantic $unc$cafe
i believe its on $unc$mckinney
okay
and originally the guy who owns the $unc$cafe $unc$pacific and the guy who owns the $unc$atlantic $unc$cafe were partners in the $unc$atlantic $unc$cafe
and then they separated
and the guy started $unc$cafe $unc$pacific
and i loved them both
i really do
i think theyre wonderful
thats our favorite
what wed really like if we just have a casual evening is houstons
have you been there
no
but ive heard thats really good too
and
its wonderful
the only thing is you have to wait
you have to expect to wait at least an hour
oh
so you have to go knowing youre going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in
and as long as you know that its okay
but they have i think just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area
oh
okay
i love it
uh-huh
and my husband really likes their ribs
so its hysterical
we go in
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
and then we get there
and we dont even look at the menu
you know right away what you want
i know right away what we want
yeah
yeah
we really enjoy prime rib too
and actually the $unc$steak and $unc$ale out here weve gone to
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when theyve had some of their specials on $unc$sunday $unc$monday or $unc$tuesday night
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the time we went the prime rib was really good
was it
really
ive been there for like lunch
uh-huh
but ive never been there for dinner
and it was good
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats great
thats great
another nice place for prime rib is $unc$baby does
ive heard about that too
maxwells nice
have you been there
but no
i guess we eat out even less than i realize
and i didnt think we ate out very often
see!
$unc$baby does is nice
oh
and $unc$one place id never been that i would really like to go to is lawrys
ive heard thats real good lawrys $unc$prime $unc$rib
yeah
yes
i had heard that too
ive never been there
but ive heard its real good
have you been to not for prime rib but the $unc$cafe $unc$de $unc$france right here on $unc$central $unc$expressway okay
yes
yes
they have $unc$one in $unc$richardson that ive been to
they have real nice lunches
have you been there for lunch
or
yes
yeah
primarily lunch and breakfast sometimes
but during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for $unc$six $unc$ninety-nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
really
really
and the
my husband and i like veal a lot
uh-huh
and their veal dishes have been good
weve tried different ones when theyve had them as $unc$one of the
the specials
uh-huh
have you ever been to biffins
i keep hearing about it
i keep hearing the advertisements of it
i
yes
no
and they keep saying its wonderful its wonderful
i have not been over there
and i was thinking its supposed to be a family place over near $unc$plano $unc$super $unc$bowl
right
and
and ive not been there
i havent either
$unc$one place
and ive only been there for lunch
but i went with a friend
and we met her husband down on $unc$greenville
down near the $unc$highway $unc$twelve area is gershwins
ive been there
we just we-
that was nice
it was
and we both enjoy mushroom soup
and $unc$linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
and they did
it was wonderful
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack
i dont know if you tried
or s-
ive heard of it
where its made
its like a
its all chocolate made like a paper bag
yes! and whip cream
and its filled with what whip cream and strawberries and something
yeah
and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry puree
oh
and we shared $unc$one the $unc$three of us
oh
and it was plenty because it was very rich
but i wished id had a camera
oh
it was beautiful
i bet it was
i bet it was
the last time we went to $unc$cafe $unc$pacific it was fathers $unc$day
and we took another friend with us
oh
and for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves
and so they had a berry assortment
it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with a custard on the bottom
oh
and they did the raspberry puree just kind of like in a decoration on the
you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it
yes
yeah
oh
and it was outstanding
it sounds wonderful
it was really relatively simple
but it was good
it was really good
thats $unc$one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant
i love fresh berries
and their fruits are always exceptional
know
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmers $unc$market you cant find them like that
you cant find them
yeah
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
im originally from $unc$connecticut
and i was home a few years ago
and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner
and i was really amazed
the restaurants up there were kind of quaint
they were real real pretty
but they lacked the service
and they lacked just the i dont know
the restaurants down here seem like they have
i guess theres so much competition that they really have to be good
uh-huh
and i thought i would really miss that
i would too
because we dont go out very often
when we do go out in a way its like a little mini vacation i guess
and its a whole experience
of course you want the food to be good
but the atmosphere and service i think are important too
uh-huh
and in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good
yeah
because the ones that arent so good just dont make it
that reminded me of a place for lunch thats a little off the beaten track
but it is wonderful
its called $unc$cafe $unc$max
and its at $unc$plano $unc$road and $unc$campbell
they have the most wonderful salads
they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed $unc$two or $unc$three
really
my favorite type of music is classical music
and i enjoy orchestral classical music
and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano
and thats my favorite type
probably the favorite instrument would be the violin
my favorite
i dont really have a favorite
i like everything basically
i guess if i had to pick it would be pop i would think
but i like everything
so its kind of hard to choose sometimes
yeah
i guess i enjoy listening to jazz sometime although i dont feel like i have a good understanding of it or a good feel for maybe whats good jazz and whats not
but i enjoy it
and sometimes i enjoy listening to fiddle music
uh-huh
we were in $unc$colorado recently
and we heard this fiddler
and we bought his tape
and its kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans
yeah
so
i grew up next door to the $unc$richardson $unc$symphony $unc$orchestra leader
so
$unc$chris $unc$xeros
yeah
you lucky thing
so we used to go and listen to them all the time
and my parents still do
yeah
i grew up with a lot of his music and what not
plus my parents are
especially my dad likes a lot of classical music
and he introduced my brother and i both to a lot of it
so
gosh
$unc$chris $unc$xeros
you grew up with his children too then
yeah
gosh
sure did
gosh
small world
yeah
we all went to high school together
and were still in contact with each other
oh
we all go back to parents houses on the weekends and what not
so
gosh
actually i used to play in the $unc$richardson $unc$symphony
i played violin in the orchestra for several years
really
yeah
so
it is a small world isnt it
yeah
small world
so i know chris
yeah
hes a pretty nice guy
most of the time
yeah
i had to work for him
and i never would want to work for him
so
no
no
life just took different turns here
so it just didnt work out to do that now
so hes about ready to retire another year
and he
yeah
he sure is
he just became a grandfather
yeah
i heard that
its his daughter that
uh-huh
yeah
they just had the babys christening
so
oh
it was really nice so
was it a boy or a girl
hes a little boy
yeah
what did they name him
i cant
its a
gosh
its like $unc$elijah or something like that
oh
i keep forgetting what she named him
oh
his middle name is $unc$chris or $unc$christopher for her daddy
of course
but i think its $unc$elijah
oh
it starts with an e
yeah
yeah
i cant remember
so youve heard the $unc$richardson $unc$symphony
yes
yeah
yeah
weve heard them and liked it real well of course
do you have a favorite instrument
actually $unc$one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord
yes
i really like those
in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding
did you
yeah
oh
which was real nice
i got married during the $unc$christmas season
and we played old fashioned $unc$christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not
and it was real nice
i liked that a lot
oh
i liked the sound of the harpsichord
and it played by itself
no
somebody played it
but you didnt have oboe or something with it
no
no
no
no
no
just by itself
just by itself
yeah
oh
it was real nice
i bet that was nice
yeah
it went well
it was a change from your traditional normal stuff since it was $unc$christmas time and we had the church decorated with $unc$christmas hollies and poinsettias and stuff like that
and so we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional $unc$christmas carols
oh
not the bouncy sing along kind but some of the older ones that
right
right
some i recognize the melodies and whatnot
but i didnt recognize the name
right
it was real nice
i play the violin in a string quartet that often plays at weddings
so i always think its a nice break from the traditional organ or piano
uh-huh
and it makes it nice
it makes you can say classy
or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else
it does
it really does
and it has such a different sound to it anyway
its almost
i dont know the way it vibrates
its kind of haunting on some of the notes
its
i like it
oh
i dont know how else to explain
but weve got friends that are in the music business that go around $unc$dallas
theyre called $unc$odessa
its a husband and wife team that weve known for years
and we try to make contact with them periodically to see whats going on and stuff too
so weve had a lot of stuff friends and things to do with music that constant
plus my husbands real big into music too
so he doesnt play anything
but he just likes to listen
yeah
and my dad and
my kids are now
my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast
and
now does the school in your city
does it offer band or some of the instruments
yeah
my oldest is only $unc$nine
okay
so he hasnt really gotten into that yet
they have choir that they go to music class that they go to
right
but hes not old enough yet to get into the band yet
right
right
i think that starts in sixth grade
probably
gosh
but i dont know
the only thing hes shown interest in wanting to play is the drums
cause my brother plays
and i dont know if hes really serious about it yet or not
its just $unc$one of those things im just going to wait and see if hes interested in something
yeah
right
right
you got a little ways to go too
right
yeah
just a little bit
hey
my oldest is $unc$eight
and weve started her on piano
so
but its been fun
its a lot of work to see that shes prepared
but its been fun
its been fun
i feel like ive learned a lot about the piano
ive learned a lot about playing the piano
really
and it kind of makes me listen a little closer to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i see and hear someone playing
i sort of watch their technique too and see if it corresponds up to what shes learning
yeah
so its been fun
i dont know if any of mine will be interested in it
or
is kind of fun
its best done when you have leisure time
and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now
and i grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake
and we had a variety of boats at our disposal
i worked for a camp for a number of years
my father was on staff there
and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats
you name it they had it
and we did a lot of water sports
but i think the thing i liked the best was we spent about a summer
couple of guys restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old $unc$four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves
or the wind came from the side
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it
if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up
it wasnt like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it upright again
this $unc$one you had to work with
you get out of the water again and get it upright
and sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind as it were tacking back and forth
and more than once wed get out there on a really stormy day
and the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing
and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesnt start raining on you right away
and that didnt always work
we oftentimes got wet
but its a nice hobby to have
nowadays i dont think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore
things change i guess
what are your memories of boating
or current
about the only memories that i have of boating
my husbands family had a motor boat when we got engaged
and they took us out on the lake several times
and i really did enjoy that
i dont know that i ever learned to drive it or anything
but we did some water skiing of course and driving around the lake in the boat and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting
they just didnt patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever
the laws were there
and if you didnt obey them there were a lot of accidents i guess
right
thats true
but i found the motor boating was real fun
yeah
i remember learning how to ski
i guess i was $unc$seven or $unc$eight years old
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the $unc$two that we had access to
and it was maybe $unc$fifteen $unc$twenty acres
and it had a lot of turtles in it
and i got all ready to go
and i was down in the water and set to go
and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back
oh
it didnt hurt too much
but it bit enough to where i let go
and the boat went off without me
and i reached back there and pushed him away and got out of the water a while
and it didnt even leave a mark
it was just a little nibble
and so i told everybody what happened
and they go yeah sure
and so i get back down in there
and ill be if he didnt do it again
this time a little earlier i had let go before then and before they took off this time and swatted him away
so i moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up
didnt go very far
but i got up
and it was a nice long skiing career
but now ive gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me
ive done about all i dare do on skis skiing on $unc$one and jumping around here and there
and i know how you can get injured doing much more than that
and i just cant risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that
just cant take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
life just changes a little bit in that respect
id kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that doesnt have a
what they call trick skis
theyll allow you to ski backwards
i havent managed to get a hold on that craft yet
but
that sounds like a real challenge
yeah
it would be kind of nice
i hadnt quite figured out
i dont have anybody to teach me either
thats another little thing
you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do
but just from what ive seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around
uh-huh
but i dont know
maybe someday ill get back to that after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end weekend or something
my son
where is your favorite place to go
we havent traveled outside the $unc$united $unc$states that much
we usually take family type vacations
were looking forward to $unc$one in $unc$october to $unc$disneyworld in $unc$florida
thats great
we have a $unc$nine year old
have you ever been there
when both of my kids were much younger
and this time were going to be going with just $unc$one daughter
and shes $unc$nine
so it ought to just be a ball
thats a perfect age for $unc$disneyworld
uh-huh
i think so too
thats great
yeah
so weve been there a number of times
and were going next year
we have a business trip every fall
we go on a lot of business trips
i dont work
wonderful
so you travel a lot
we do
we g-
my husband travels a couple times a month
and in the position hes in they dont care if i go along
uh-huh
so its great
i just kind of join up when its something interesting
and $unc$disneyworld is the $unc$one for a week next year
sure
uh-huh
and it will be at this time of the year
and this year matter of fact were leaving next $unc$saturday for $unc$new $unc$orleans
that will be fun too
have you ever been there
yes
we went years ago
we havent been lately
and i know theyve changed it a lot and upgraded everything
but we used to have a lot of fun there
we went there once
in fact we had been in $unc$dallas
and we were on our way home
and we were driving
and we said lets go to $unc$new $unc$orleans
so when he said this year i have a week there on a project
hes going to be
and then i said ill going along
i hope its swimming season
because it wasnt a tremendous amount of things that i wanted to do there
uh-huh
yeah
if you dont like the night life and the antique shopping there isnt much there
but that can be fun
and thats probably
we do like the night life to an extent
and they do have a $unc$mardi $unc$gras night planned
uh-huh
and im kind of anxious for that
but yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better
did you know that next week theres several t v shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
no
i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows
and with a daughter $unc$nine it is just
shes old enough to really grasp the meaning behind
yes
be excited about all of it
if youre working then youre probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
not really
were doing the same thing tying it in with my husbands business trip
and i just save vacation for things like that and just travel whenever we can
thats
i think travel
when i heard my topic today i thought okay thats my favorite
how easy
becau-
right
and really at our point of life our children are grown
and it has just worked out really well with this position hes in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you
uh-huh
and it depends where hes going whether or not i decide to go along
sure
but i do like to travel
and its
i dont mind the pool life at all during the day
uh-huh
and i like to sight see
and i love to shop
uh-huh
its
thats perfect
what more could you ask for
thats right
but it
and then got to pick and choose the places
and $unc$one of my very favorite is $unc$las $unc$vegas
oh
that
i would have to say we both end up going to $unc$las $unc$vegas probably once every maybe year and a half
uh-huh
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles
uh-huh
and so ive just requested that they send us $unc$two of our coach tickets
because we have a lot of flying with $unc$continental
uh-huh
and theyre recommending that you use those because they dont know the future of $unc$continental
right
its kind of shaky
and i said now that we have all the miles
we better start using them
thats true
it really is
so we are thinking that we might go to $unc$las $unc$vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip
when we normally go that way we like to go to $unc$california at the same time because we really dont get out there as often as you could probably from $unc$texas
uh-huh
our last big trip we drove through $unc$new $unc$mexico and $unc$colorado and went to the $unc$grand $unc$canyon and back through $unc$silverton and $unc$durango
and it was fun
it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country
and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it
our
i think thats a good trip
uh-huh
and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
right
now we did what we sometimes do since we are in $unc$ohio
and it takes a while just to even get to what i would call the more picturesque part of the country
we will fly to something like
once we flew to $unc$denver
and then we rented a car for $unc$two weeks
and we went through the northern route and through $unc$utah and as far west as $unc$las $unc$vegas
uh-huh
and then we returned through $unc$new $unc$mexico that you just mentioned
uh-huh
and it was just great
theres too much to see really
i think thats the way to
i work at $unc$t $unc$i
and we have of course started random drug testing here
and i havent gotten called yet
but i feel that its pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
do they feel that way
i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at $unc$t $unc$i
but i think our latest statistic said something like $unc$ninety-nine point $unc$nine $unc$eight percent were testing negative on all the testing
uh-huh
i think its a good idea just because im opposed to the drugs
uh-huh
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it
uh-huh
its
i dont know
i dont really liken it to alcohol
but yet that can be carried to an extreme too
uh-huh
so i think its a good idea
and i think just the idea that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because youre
right
i dont know that their job would be at risk
because i think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs
right
i would think that
is that how they do it at $unc$t $unc$i maybe
that
right
i
at $unc$t $unc$i if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then youre put on a program
and you go through the program
and then youre called like $unc$six months after you complete the program
uh-huh
and if you test positive then youre terminated
i guess i draw a hard line
but im in favor of that type of thing that you have people out there that are responsible for certain things
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you expect them to do their job
and it is possible that they cant do as good a job as they might do
thats right
uh-huh
and of course they can also cause injury to other people
uh-huh
if theyre not fully functional mentally while theyre doing their job they could cause serious injury to another people
right
and you never know
they could just go off the deep end on something whatever theyre taking at the time
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it would be out of the question
uh-huh
also i guess you can get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or whatever all kinds
thats right
yeah
i sub in the schools
uh-huh
so ive had a
they talk a lot about drugs there
right
and i think its good that theyre trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
right
but i think they can test all they want for drugs
and if they need to do that as a condition for employment
uh-huh
and i know many of them are doing it
i know my son has had to do it for both sams and $unc$wal-mart
uh-huh
and i dont know how many others are doing that
and i think thats good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age
yes
uh-huh
thats right
and i dont know
its just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle i think
uh-huh
i think personally im for it
theres several reason why i could think of right now why we shouldnt have it such as drug testing
they say runs approximately a $unc$thousand dollars a person every time you do it
really
and
its that high
yes
and yeah
its very expensive
oh
and
i didnt realize it was that expensive
uh-huh
its not like a normal urinalysis
uh-huh
its very expensive to run them
and i didnt get a raise this year
because nobody in our company got a raise
uh-huh
but yet they spend all the money on drug testing
just lucky to have jobs
and if they werent spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise
so theres different
i think thats more of a personal view of mine other than a yes sir we should have drug testing because theres really a problem
uh-huh
and i know that
but then i have other views to it
i didnt think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
uh-huh
and sams and $unc$wal-mart are owned by the same people
uh-huh
he took $unc$one for $unc$wal-mart for job hiring
uh-huh
and then sams called him
and he took another $unc$one
right
and i dont know why they both made him do that since it was so close together
uh-huh
i can see if
because if its a $unc$thousand dollars thats a $unc$thousand dollars they wasted
theirs might not run a $unc$thousand dollars
our
from what i understanding here at $unc$t $unc$i they run close to a $unc$thousand dollars an employee
maybe they run
i dont know
thats just guessing it
maybe they run a lot of other tests
or maybe its under a health type program that it would catch a lot of things
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just cant imagine them screening all these employees paying a $unc$thousand dollars to get them
but no
for all the pub-
its
have you done any painting projects lately
yeah
this is a great topic for me because i just did my first $unc$two painting projects ever
really
was not a big deal
what kind of painting was it
$unc$two little deals
the first $unc$one
i helped someone repaint an apartment
and it was very easy
uh-huh
was it
yeah
and ive never painted anyth-
i always thought it would be
so youd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something
yeah
but i know i can do it
uh-huh
and the second $unc$one was i bought some toys at a craft fair
uh-huh
theyre unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for $unc$christmas
and so i decided to paint them
and that wasnt as easy as painting the apartment
what kind of paint did you use for the bookends
thats half the problem right there is that it was a oil base
so i had to get
and when i painted them i didnt realize that we didnt have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house
so i had it all over my hands
at first i didnt realize
i had never painted anything
so i didnt realize that i needed that
uh-huh
i kind of knew in the back of my mind
you cant use oil on wood
no
you can use it on wood
but i just had it all over my hands
and i went to wash the brushes out and wash my hands
and you cant wash it off with water
you have to get a solution
and
you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway
yeah
i had to drive to the store
yeah
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and everything like that
and then downstairs in the apartment we just used a latex base
and so you can drip it on
if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean
is that what you usually use in the house is latex
yeah
and it just like
the same with the toys
its just important to look for $unc$one that doesnt have lead in it
it says safe for children and all that
uh-huh
yeah
i heard about that
i guess a friend of mine had a
she just started up a day care center
and $unc$one of the real strict restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
yeah
so she had that done
but that you keep some farm equipment in
have you painted anything recently
wow was it huge
uh-huh
and what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer
and i had this big $unc$five gallon jug
and it was like paint thinner
it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner
yeah
but you just took a roller and put it on there
and if you saw that the wood was getting wet that was all you needed
so
wow
yeah
it was
it used all of it
i guess it was about $unc$three $unc$hundred yards worth
so i guess it worked out
it was pretty easy actually
yeah
i think though were lucky that we didnt have to do any detail work because i dont know if i could
i dont know
i dont know
must be difficult
what about the trim in your house
did you have to do that
no
it was really easy
i just what
we had a couple of different size brushes real easy
uh-huh
i went around the trim
and if it
and there was wall paper
i was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows
and there was wall paper
and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried
uh-huh
it came right off
yeah
so there was no major mistakes
there was
did you have $unc$one coat or $unc$two
$unc$two actually
uh-huh
and it
there was
around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that
but that
yeah
that would be really a time saver
yeah
if you just
we didnt tape anything
we werent that careful
but it wasnt
i dont know its funny
its like if you just go slow at least i didnt get that many mistakes
uh-huh
i didnt make that many mistakes
me i would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges
and then id have probably rolled it on
it would have taken me forever
why
just because youd be afraid to do it or have you done it before
yeah
the first time itd probably would have taken me forever
so
it wasnt
if it was my own i would have
but my friend said just go ahead you just go ahead its easy
i said okay its your place
how long did it take you all
a couple of week ends
we would go down $unc$two or $unc$three hours on the weekends
uh-huh
and
so there was $unc$two of you all
no
they were doing all sorts of repairs
and i was just painting because i dont know how to do anything else
thats easy enough
so theres a whole bunch of people
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else
i think i could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it
yeah
but i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys
and the guy said get this its a nice shiny gloss which was true
but i didnt realize what pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you dont have latex
i dont if
its worth the shine
uh-huh
how did you like that topic
i dont know
ive got mixed feelings about the topic
do you
i dont
no
okay
no
im pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know
i agree with it
i think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit
i just dont think theres a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
i dont believe in drugs or alcohol
but if youll remember when the teachers had to take the $unc$t $unc$cat they were talking about drug testing us
right
uh-huh
and we were laughing that wed have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine
uh-huh
and we found it belittling
you did
yeah
uh-huh i can sort of understand that
but not being a teacher as you are i was not quite as sympathetic as i probably would have been if $unc$kay were a teacher or something
thats true
but
but then at the same token im not against
because i look at airline pilots bus drivers people that really have other peoples lives in their hands truck drivers
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
thats right
its supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol
thats right
and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read
and
but
in those areas i really do believe that maybe we should clean up our house
yeah
i think so too
i agree with it
i know kays company
they started it couple of years ago
and so many of the people even the professional people boy they were so against them doing that
and i thought jeez to me its quite simple
you either need a job or you dont
the job is what provides all of your needs
and if they say hey you cant do this work id say hey i agree i wont do that
and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didnt like it at first
yeah
i think its just like anything else a new concept
as i said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted
yeah
it is
i can see where you would think
yeah
but at the same token in education we cant do random drug testing on kids
yeah
thats true
their rights are protected
you bet
gosh they would really raise a stink if that was to happen
what
but if youre going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and theyre under the influence
right
yes
i agree with that
i wouldnt be opposed to it at all
its just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail
thats true
but $unc$lynn ive enjoyed talking with you
i dont know how long were supposed to carry on a conversation do you
its $unc$three minutes
and the clicker comes in when its time to
wed better keep talking because ive not heard it have we
yeah
have you heard it
no
anyway we both sort of agree on it dont we about random testing
do we agree or unless its not me
listen
here we go again
yeah
yeah
yeah
if you agree that
i believe that truck drivers and people that have
even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands if they come in stoned or they come in drunk
yeah
and there was an incident in my childrens high school where a teacher stayed drunk
is that right
uh-huh
you just dont think of that happening with teachers
and he
i really dont
when i think of drug testing im thinking of the outside of education
no
we are as susceptible a society as anybody else
sure
i know that
but you dont think of that first hand normally
and
yeah
did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation
isnt that mind boggling
it was on the news tonight
goodness
its mind bog-
i agree with you
i know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same good qualities as anybody else
yeah
then i think if push came to shove id probably be drug tested
yeah
yeah
because it does
you think the benefit would be greater than the
yeah
because as i say im sitting there fussing and fussing
and yet i know of $unc$one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as i presume out
uh-huh
and that was in your childrens high school
uh-huh
isnt that amazing
and my children brought it to my attention
i never was there to see it
if it was true there im sure its true with just about probably to some degree every school there is
uh-huh
because they represent a pretty good
and thats not giving a good example to students
no
certainly not
certainly not
they dont need that example
but
okay
i missed a part of it
were to talk about what lawns and gardens
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do
im a putterer
i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard
uh-huh
uh-huh
i
its very strange that i got this call because my wife just called me
i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden
oh
this type of thing is working right in to start planting $unc$fall bulbs
uh-huh
weve had a late $unc$fall
it seems like the weather
in fact today its really warm
and so many of the $unc$summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up
but you need to pretty soon
thats the way this was
the petunias were really great
our mums are beautiful
oh
i dont think weve had a frost up here
i was down in for a week
so i dont know what happened last week
uh-huh
but i dont know if its late
im sort of waiting for indian $unc$summer
so i can get a lot of stuff down out here
uh-huh
i enjoy it
we moved in $unc$november and put all the landscaping in this year
we came from $unc$nine years in a condo
and working in that condo you didnt have to do anything unless you really wanted to
uh-huh
so
now you have the chance to really create and spread out
right
i cant
this is my third house i think ive owned
but its interesting
the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling
and it sort of gets away from me if youre not with it
uh-huh
but i enjoy most of it
and about this time of year it starts getting a little old
and i start looking forward to having other things to do with my
the grass not growing so fast
it is for me
because ive been doing a lot of fertilizing
we had a terrible $unc$summer
we had a drought
oh
and took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing
and now its really growing
and im trying to establish a good root growth for the $unc$winter
ours seems to have slowed down here
were not having to mow every week religiously
really
but were still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the summer flowers out
i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
really
uh-huh
but today its $unc$eighty-five degrees
yeah
its really strange
yeah
i hear that from my brother-in-law lives in $unc$plano
but thatll change real quick
yeah
he always
well wish wed planted bulbs and pansies already
he waits until it gets about $unc$seventeen below up here
and then he calls us
my gosh
yeah
its $unc$seventy degrees here in the sunshine
so
$unc$texas has gotten to where its a real problem as far as plants because our $unc$summers are so terribly hot
and we have ice storms every year
and there just arent that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes
uh-huh
some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they dont make it through the $unc$two swings
yeah
that is
i was conditioned to it
uh-huh
they have to be hardened to it
thats strange with me
you think $unc$dallas almost semitropical you wouldnt have that kind of problem
but
for the most part we dont
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold
the $unc$summers have gotten where theyre a lot hotter
uh-huh
but the ice storms really are stressful on all the plants that we have around
weve noticed that crepe myrtles dont do as well as they used to and pittosporum
really
do they
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
uh-huh
you really take a chance with them freezing
i love
yeah
i love the landscaping
like i say my brother-in-law i get to $unc$carrollton quite a bit
uh-huh
i go there on business
and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens
and $unc$dallas is very nice
i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens
uh-huh
and my wife and i
except for the lack of trees out where we are it was all cotton fields
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it
yeah
that we have
uh-huh
ohios a very pretty state
in $unc$seventy-six we moved to $unc$chicago
we lived there for $unc$five years
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt
we were coming in
and before the plane landed she looked out the window
and she said theres no trees down there
this is $unc$illinois
youre not
and when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land
uh-huh
and now all of a sudden it was being developed
and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
very good
discussion on child care
do you have any children
theyre all grown up
oh
i work in a day-care center
and
you know all about it then
yes
i enjoy it a lot
its been quite a few years
i have grandchildren but havent really been into selecting child care for them
so
oh
and its been quite a few years since ive had to think about that
do they go to a day-care center
or do they stay at
no
my daughter that has $unc$three stays home with her children
thats nice
and $unc$one of my daughters has $unc$one
but an aunt keeps the baby
thats nice
but i would not really know how to go about selecting $unc$one nowadays
but i would imagine its very hard
i think so
i think its hard to find a good day care
i have worked at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion
uh-huh
but this $unc$one that im in now is very good
and $unc$one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children
uh-huh
and in $unc$pennsylvania for babies thats what i work with there has to be a $unc$one to $unc$four ratio at the most no more than $unc$four babies per care giver
uh-huh
but we keep it down to like $unc$two to $unc$one
thats good
yeah
that makes it a little easier to deal with
ive always thought it would be really tough
what if you had a fire or something with babies
i know
we
you would have to be able to have enough
youd have to be able to get them all out
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are low to the ground
uh-huh
and theyre reenforced real strong
and theyll sit $unc$four babies
we would just lie them in there
and they roll real well and maneuver
thats a
that will get them out
i hadnt thought about that
but i was thinking my gosh if they had very many babies they couldnt possibly get them all out
no
but you could put them in $unc$one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
right
right
thats neat
yeah
thats certainly something we hope never happens
do most of your day-care workers really care about the children
or is it just a job for them
most really care in this center really care
most everyone has a college degree in early childhood education
uh-huh
and really theres only like $unc$eight children per room
and then theres like or mostly $unc$three care givers in each room
uh-huh
and that enables them to spend more time with the children
sometimes i feel like all im doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap
so its nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them
uh-huh
its easy to get attached to them too
yeah
how old are the children go with this center where you work
in my room they go from $unc$eight weeks to $unc$nine months
uh-huh
and throughout the center it goes up to age $unc$twelve
uh-huh
i have the real young ones in my room
youve got the little bitty ones
uh-huh
those are probably the best group to have
theyre wonderful
they dont complain too much
and theyre fun
yes
they are a lot of fun
babies are fun
and theyre not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet
so
not quite
its a
when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things
and
uh-huh
you have to be real careful everything is baby proof
all the doors have latches and stuff so they cant get into anything
but they try
uh-huh
do you think theres very many really good day-care centers around your area
but yeah
in my area
because i live in a college town in $unc$penn $unc$state $unc$university
uh-huh
so i
there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of whats going on
uh-huh
and in general though ive been really disappointed with a lot of other centers ive worked at and all
uh-huh
its not my choice for when i have children
but some people dont have a choice
sometimes its a have to
yes
i hear a lot of the girls i work with constantly
i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about
uh-huh
most of them dont really feel that its a great place to leave their kids
that is sad
and its really bad
$unc$one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place
and then they called her $unc$one afternoon and said we thought wed better call and tell you before you got over here
$unc$lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today
and we just now found her
what
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
my $unc$god
and so immediately she says i cant have any confidence in them anymore
if theyll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize theyre $unc$one short
oh
but $unc$one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus
my $unc$god
and this was $unc$four hours later
that poor child
so
what do you do
thats awful
so she has switched to a different center now
and
i
okay
just to let you know i have $unc$two children of my own
ive got $unc$two boys $unc$one $unc$four year old and $unc$one $unc$two years old
so im just starting out
yes
i have $unc$two boys who are $unc$twenty-eight and $unc$twenty-four and a daughter who is $unc$twelve
wow
wow
thats quite a spread
yes
same husband everything
thats great
but
i guess $unc$one of the things that i like to do with my boys when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them
theyre not very old
so they couldnt do a whole lot yet
uh-huh
but they like to spend time with me
we just do various things nothing really
they like to be outside as much as possible
if its not raining
right
but the weathers trying to turn now
so
are you down here in $unc$texas
yes
im in $unc$dallas
okay
yeah
you know what i meant with rain
right
right
oh
right
okay
what
yeah
what
$unc$one of the trends ive noticed is that its always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the t v and let them watch movies or play video games or something
yeah
i have
can you hold on just a sec-
sure
i have to answer a business phone
sure
i hate to do it on this call
thats okay
good morning $unc$a $unc$r $unc$e this is $unc$arlene $unc$lister
it was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway
im sorry
keep going
no
its okay
so that was the thing that i noticed that i know a lot of friends that they have a tendency to do the same thing
and $unc$one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be entertained that way
uh-huh
and seeing as youve got some older children im wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up
yeah
there was not nearly as much of it
in fact i think things were quite a bit different
uh-huh
when my big kids were little all the mothers were home
uh-huh
the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around
and then when they felt like it they went out to play when they were little like that
uh-huh
right
and i think its gotten very different
when my second one was little they were coming out with $unc$sesame $unc$street which he started watching
right
and other than that there was not educational t v
or you got some cartoons
and that was it
but they were never that interested in it anyway
theyd take their trucks out in the backyard go out and play and stuff
right
but we always did just to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum
uh-huh
we did a lot of stuff like that with our kids
uh-huh
and course when they got bigger they were both quite into sports
and so whatever they would do wed go along with
uh-huh
yeah
and a girl is very different
we have
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping
right
so theyre very different
but y-
kind of the same thing our
she now
lot of time spent with her
shes so busy
is going to
uh-huh
last night was a band concert
uh-huh
and she plays on her school volleyball team and stuff like that
but we still like to pack up just go someplace for the day or just stuff like that
right
$unc$one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at $unc$college $unc$station
thats nice
thats
we go down there fairly often for a weekend for family get-togethers and stuff like that
thats great
thats great
i know id like to get into do more camping and outings and things
and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older
uh-huh
but for right now they dont
just getting out in the front and just being outside is good for them
because they like just being outside
yes
yeah
i think our kids just always dearly loved that play bounce the ball or just
uh-huh
course when our big ones were little we lived up north
uh-huh
and this time of the year the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves
right
so its very different
thats true
you dont see many leaves around $unc$dallas
and come winter time wed stick them on sleds
and we had a pond across the street
uh-huh
and from little on
im
its so different down here where you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something
when our kids were little you got them a pair of skates
what kind of car are you thinking of buying next
more than likely its going to be a $unc$chrysler
you like the $unc$chrysler products do you
$unc$chrysler $unc$lebaron
yeah
it wont be a $unc$ford
ive got a $unc$ford $unc$mustang now
and i hate it
do you really
yeah
what year is it
its a $unc$eighty-eight
and why dont you like the $unc$mustang
its
ive had $unc$one problem with it after the other
ill be darned
the paints peeling off of it or find them road dead
you know the old sayings about $unc$fords what they stand for
there you go
that
i
its
my electrical system shorted out $unc$two or $unc$three times
and its been torn up since $unc$april
and luckily everything was under warranty
so its only costing a $unc$hundred and $unc$forty dollars to get it fixed
it would have been $unc$two $unc$thousand
weve always had $unc$oldsmobiles and been very happy with $unc$oldsmobiles
but my wife thought she wanted to get a $unc$ford $unc$mustang
and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be $unc$one of those $unc$mitsubishi $unc$eclipses
she likes those
those are nice cars
she has a sister that lives in $unc$phoenix that has $unc$one and really enjoys it
what things do you consider when you buy a car
the gas mileage for $unc$one thing
and ive always had stick shift
the next car i get i want it to be automatic
i see
i hate driving anyway
and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now
yeah
especially when youre in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time
yeah
and when you work $unc$nine to $unc$five or $unc$eight to $unc$five and youre in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately
that makes it very frustrating
and i look
and $unc$one of the things with $unc$chrysler right now is the warranties that they have
and i feel like their
everybody ive talked to that owns $unc$one has been real pleased with it
and i like the drivers air bag
i like that
now this is a $unc$lebaron
yeah
all $unc$chrysler products has it in there
but $unc$lebaron would be the next car i get
yeah
i sure like those rag top $unc$lebarons
they really look sporty
yeah
yeah
i like that too
but i couldnt afford the insurance on $unc$one of those
we always
this last $unc$oldsmobile we bought its an $unc$eighty-seven
but we bought it in $unc$eighty-eight right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them
yeah
and we found a real good interest rate
when theyre trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices
and we looked around at used cars
and we really couldnt afford the payments on a used car
because if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge $unc$twelve $unc$thirteen percent
and we ended up i think with a $unc$four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and the payments
thats what im paying on mine now
i had to get a first time
my dads always cosigned on my loans or whatever
and this is $unc$one when i bought
i got my $unc$mustang this time by myself because i got on my own or whatever
and i had said
they said it had to be a first time buyers car or whatever
and theyre charging me unreasonable interest
but ive got $unc$eight more payments
and its paid for
thats great
but i got it when the eighty-eights first came out
its a good car i got in $unc$eighty-seven i guess in $unc$november or something like that
and
uh-huh
when our kids were younger we really wanted a $unc$two door
our first car was an $unc$oldsmobile back in $unc$seventy-seven
it was a $unc$two door $unc$cutlass $unc$supreme
and it just happened that when we looked for our new car they had a thing going with $unc$oldsmobile
and if youd buy a new $unc$oldsmobile theyd give you $unc$four $unc$hundred rebate because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary
uh-huh
i belie-
yeah
seventy-fifth anniversary
so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our papers on our first car
and they gave us another $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars off on it
so we got a $unc$four door this time
and i sort of went more for the comfort factor
and i liked the smaller cars
but im a bigger person
and i really like comfort driving along the road and stuff
thats another big factor of mine
next car i gets going to be a $unc$four door too something with some room
yeah
because my $unc$mustang is $unc$two door with bucket seats
and you buy groceries and stuff like that
and if you try to take anybody go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
okay
what do you feel are some of the main problems
im in an urban area
im in $unc$dallas
uh-huh
and were finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem
in $unc$dallas some of the major problems
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now
there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs
yeah
and i think thats a national problem though
its pretty bad here too
its not unique
weve had a lot of murders drug related and stuff in $unc$durham which is right next to $unc$raleigh
yes
uh-huh
now were pretty close to the golden triangle arent you
yeah
that
$unc$durham $unc$raleigh and $unc$chapel $unc$hill is the triangle
right
research triangle and all of that
right
and im sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers
so you may have perhaps a little better economic climate
but in all your cities now it seems like there is a crowd thats really effected by this bill
yeah
really its
and ive seen more in $unc$durham than i have in $unc$raleigh or $unc$chapel $unc$hill
really
$unc$chapel $unc$hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever
its kind of
im sure there is problems with it
but it has a pretty low crime rate compared to $unc$durham has probably got the worst
theyve had $unc$forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year
really
and over half of it has been drug related
here im not sure how many $unc$dallas has had
ive
$unc$houston is averaging about $unc$two a week or $unc$three or $unc$four
i dont know
a number every week
yeah
$unc$dallas is having quite a few
$unc$seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or like i say drug related
i guess the other thing that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values
$unc$seems like a lot of people dont hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to
yeah
i
that
and the economy is so bad
and so many people have been laid off and stuff
the economy is lousy
theyve done special stories on the local news here
uh-huh
we had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff
i know like a week or so ago
i live in a town house which is
its a pretty nice neighborhood
and this lady was going to work
she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything
and nobody thought any different
they just thought she was moving
it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned
boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that
yeah
its pretty bad
now do you find that security is very good in a town home
i would say so for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
uh-huh
and we all know $unc$one another
and on our $unc$one little section of the street we all know $unc$one another and know that were not moving and different things like that
that
its
im probably $unc$one of the youngest people that live over here
i see
most people are retired
or theyre in their forties or whatever
and im in my twenties
so im out more than they are
but theyre at home at night
yeah
so i really dont worry about anything
i think you hit on $unc$one point there is you know each other
yeah
im in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything
i am about $unc$three blocks off a major road and a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the commercial districts
and im over the northeast part of $unc$dallas
its in a nice neighborhood
the houses here before the recession were running $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$thousand or so
and course everythings down $unc$ten to $unc$twenty percent now
yeah
thats the same thing here
but we have
$unc$one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
and now the economy is bad
they have trouble keeping those full
so theyve dropped the
theyre not nearly as selective as they used to be
yeah
and course thats kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex
you start letting that happen and they go down
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things
so im sure that aggravates it also
yeah
but unemployment now in $unc$dallas or in $unc$texas is up around $unc$six point
i guess were supposed to talk about whats being done about recycling
yes
lots right
right
finally
really
what do you do now
we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the $unc$boy $unc$scouts our boys have been involved in have had a huge recycling bin over at $unc$resurrection $unc$lutheran $unc$church
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so weve done that for quite some time
but since the price of paper has gone down
its about a fifth of what it used to be
really
so the $unc$boy $unc$scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over
okay
now we just put ours out for the $unc$city of $unc$plano
do you live in $unc$plano
yes
i do
okay
yeah
yeah
and im so glad when they brought out those recycling bins
right
have you had yours now
yes
yeah
although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that work in the library for me said they hadnt gotten theirs
thats why i asked you
yeah
and not everyone got theirs right away
yeah
yeah
and i was so relieved because ive been making a real concerted effort recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because $unc$wal-mart collected it
uh-huh
right
yeah
we used to take ours there
and
my garage was just getting overwhelmed
i know
and of course i didnt go weekly
so it became quite a big thing
right
and
right
im really glad they do it
yeah
i do mostly newspapers and plastic $unc$two liter diet $unc$coke bottles and aluminum cans some
yes
yeah
but i dont use as many of those
uh-huh
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out
yeah
i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that theyre not a recycling number $unc$one or $unc$two
ha
ha
wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there
thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
yeah
yeah
but its not that hard now that ive got this system under control
got your routine down
yeah
yeah
i guess there are some places in the north in particular that have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle
because lets see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
uh-huh
so if you recycle things of course then you dont have all that weight in there
yeah
i do find that i dont have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are being tossed in with the recycling
right
thats right
yeah
yeah
and i dont know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than
what are some of the things they dont recycle
$unc$one thing i thought about the other day were batteries
just everyday regular batteries supposedly leak and contaminate the landfills
right
and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out
yeah
right
and they dont take
probably going to throw them in your trash
yeah
thats what happens
because
there are places that take car batteries
but i wonder if they would take
yeah
not that it would
kind of a pain to drive over somewhere special for $unc$two little tiny batteries
but
yeah
yeah
but i think the city $unc$one could possibly look into that or something
yeah
thats true
if theyve got these bins for all the other little items
im sure if people will have batteries quite often to toss out
right
thats true
when i was home those few days around $unc$thanksgiving and the truck came by we all ran out to watch it because wed never really seen it pick up our stuff
uh-huh
and $unc$one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
oh
is that right
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just scanned it
i dont know what that was reading it for
but
registering our garbage
they must be trying to keep track of who is doing it or what i guess
yeah
i dont know
another
wouldnt it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year
for those who are really cooperating
yeah
that would encourage it
except i know it would just not be cost effective
theyve already got all this money out on getting the trucks and hiring people to work them
im sure they couldnt afford that
sure
but
sure
but the garbage
there is just $unc$one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of $unc$two
yeah
yeah
thats interesting
also slightly off the subject but our big green garbage thing got stolen
it did
uh-huh
gosh
and we called the city
and they brought us a new $unc$one
and they did not charge us
and they said that between $unc$three and $unc$four $unc$hundred have been stolen
my goodness
isnt that sad
it is sad
and just
they paid for those things anyway
and they must be really expensive
or our taxes do
of course we were hoping we werent going to have to pay for it
uh-huh
but what would somebody do with them
$unc$arlington $unc$texas
since i got somebody from $unc$arlington $unc$virginia $unc$one day
is that right
yeah
i never thought about that
but there is an $unc$arlington
i had a call the other day from $unc$birmingham $unc$michigan
oh
and i was thinking
$unc$birmingham
the only $unc$birmingham i could think of was $unc$alabama
right
its funny how many names have been used all over the country
yeah
tell me what kind of books have you read
to tell you the truth ive been going to college for the last $unc$four years
so mainly text books
i was going to say not fun kind right
no
but i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones
uh-huh
but sometimes biogr-
i just read one about $unc$grace $unc$kelley
i love to read about real people
to me half the time its more fascinating than some of these made up stories
yeah
it is
because its really and truly a true thing
yeah
it happened
i read $unc$one about $unc$bob $unc$hope that i liked
really
yeah
that was real good
im like you
if its not a heavy biography i enjoy it
right
i used to like to read about royalty a lot
when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived i think in $unc$europe
that was my thing for a while
i was trying to think
i read a novel that used the names of like $unc$princess $unc$di and $unc$prince $unc$phillip coming over here to be entertained and all
and there was a murder
really
yeah
it was some time ago
seems like it was the spy went dancing or something like that
it sounds like fun
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names
wonder if it was by $unc$one of those famous writers
$unc$margaret $unc$truman $unc$daniels writes a lot those
yeah
in fact i believe it was
because
really
uh-huh
i believe
sounds like something she would write
yeah
i think it was by her now that you mention it because someone had given it to me
and i thought this will be great
and it was
yeah
ive heard that her books are really interesting
and they always sell well
uh-huh
and
when you use real people like that i think royalty especially
yeah
brings it to life
i know some of the british people laugh at us because were so enthralled with their royalty
yeah
but thats like them being enthralled with our football and so forth
i know
our movie stars
our movie stars
because its totally different concept to us
right
i havent had a chance to read a lot lately either
i have read mostly novels
i went to visit my daughter in $unc$florida
and i took a novel with me and read it at $unc$thanksgiving time
and it was $unc$one of those generation novels
yes
starts out when theyre small and continues through generations
i always like those
and i like that
have you ever read anything by $unc$susan $unc$howatch
yes
i have
isnt she fabulous
she is wonderful
once you st-
i dont like to get $unc$one of her books
because i just live to read
ill skip everything just to get back to the book
i stayed up $unc$one night i think until $unc$two in the morning finishing $unc$one of hers because i could not put it down
yeah
shes just a
i dont know
how often does she come out with them
i probably have missed the last few since ive been back in school
no
it seems like she doesnt write as often as like $unc$danielle $unc$steele and those silly things
she writes the same thing
she can turn them out overnight i swear
yeah
and theyre the same silly things
if youve read $unc$one i mean its practically the same thing over and over
yeah
ive never read a whole $unc$one of hers i dont think
and think how rich she is
yeah
wouldnt i
im criticizing her
and wouldnt i like to have her money
yeah
because they go from hardback to paperback
and she has millions of them
and then make movies out of some of them
uh-huh
mini series and so forth
and it seems to me like $unc$susan $unc$howatch does not write as often
i have not seen as many of hers
hers are so involved
and theyre such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot
uh-huh
i think she does a lot of research too
i do too
she couldnt possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers
huh-uh
but her books are just incredible
i dont think theyve ever made a movie do you
no
i dont think so
and ive often wondered why havent you
yes
i
no
i really just thought about it now
but theres just
yeah
maybe its because they take so much in
i dont know
uh-huh
maybe theyre just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them
theyre so big
uh-huh
theyre such
it would be like another gone with the wind i guess another $unc$three hour movie
yeah
and maybe that turns people off
but look at gone with the wind
i know
its about $unc$one of my favorite movies
have you gotten into $unc$scarlett yet
no
it had such a bad press
i wasnt too
yeah
thats exactly what i was going to say
i was amazed
because i
in the beginning when it was on route coming out i heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad
uh-huh
right
and then when it came out all i heard was just how bad it was that i didnt even want to get it
me either
do you know anyone thats read it
huh-uh
no
i havent heard of anybody thats read it either
no
i think it was on the best-seller list though for a while
it wouldnt surprise me
are you there
uh-huh
okay
tell me your favorite team
baseball
yes
ive kind of been intrigued with the rangers more so with their management than anything else
i dont follow baseball that closely
but since i live here so close to $unc$arlington thats the team that ive been kind of following
okay
i think its a little bit late in the season for them to assign us
where do you think theyre headed
so well have to talk about the future with the $unc$rangers
uh-huh
right
what are your thinkings on what they can do what theyll be able to do
i think that with so much controversy over $unc$ruben $unc$sierra not signing and asking us for so much money its i think
im not real sure about th-
do you know anything about $unc$ruben sierras
i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his
yeah
that he was willing to come down a little bit but a little bit from $unc$thirty $unc$million dollars or $unc$thirty-five $unc$mil-
yes
and the $unc$rangers go up a little bit
uh-huh
thats a lot of money
i think the entire baseball
yeah
theyre the ones that probably are paying the highest
yeah
they are
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous
uh-huh
no
and i really think that they ought to
im not real sure that they should pay him that much money
i think they should pay him what his salary is going to be and let him
because hes got $unc$one more year before he turns into a free agent
thats right
and then who knows
if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway
but if he doesnt then his market value will go down
and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the $unc$six $unc$million dollars a year this year
what i saw on the news today that
$unc$buechele was back just to visit
uh-huh
im awful sorry hes not still
yeah
but what he
that was a great deal for him
im sure it was
yeah
it was a great deal for him
and he just signed on
i think it was like a $unc$five year deal with $unc$pittsburgh
$unc$pittsburgh
yeah
so hes real happy there
as far as the $unc$rangers are concerned i think they definitely need some pitching
yes sir
and so i
what do you think of $unc$howse who is the coach for the pitchers
the pitching coach
yes
i was just looking at the news tonight
and they showed a black guy that was helping out his assistant
his assistant
uh-huh
and i think thats a great addition
he seemed to know what he was doing
and
i really wish they could see fit to get rid of $unc$howse
you dont like $unc$howse
no
no
i really dont
and im not going to stand up on my soapbox and say that
but im not fond of $unc$howse
and im not fond of $unc$grieves
$unc$tom $unc$grieve
yeah
yeah
im not sure that theyre ready to get rid of $unc$tom $unc$grieve yet
but $unc$howse might be a different situation
and i think youre probably right that they need some changes in pitching coach maybe
and
im just gullible enough that i think $unc$bobby $unc$valentine is doing all right
and im sure
you do
thats contrary to popular belief
i know
i know so
but i would like so much for these $unc$rangers to get their act together and give $unc$nolan $unc$ryan the support he needs
i know
its too bad that it has to be a $unc$forty-two year old guy to lead the $unc$rangers
i understand
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead
and
yeah
i have so many mixed emotions about all this
but i think with their new stadium they should go and let
okay
if youre from $unc$iowa you must be very artsy crafty
everyone ive ever known from the $unc$midwest can do everything with their hands
actually im from $unc$california
and before then i was from $unc$utah
so
i didnt know anyone ever moved from $unc$california to $unc$iowa
i grew up in $unc$california
and then i went to school in $unc$utah
and i got married there
and we stayed there for a while
and then now were in $unc$iowa
im teasing only because im from $unc$indiana
really
i like the $unc$midwest
oh
but i married a $unc$texan
and they have a way of dragging you back home
anyway were supposed to be talking about crafts
do you have any hobbies that you do things with your hands like knitting or
i crochet
and i do water color
and i sew
and i do fabric painting
you do a lot then
do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching
ive done some cross stitching
i havent tried any needlepoint yet
how about you
actually im pretty untalented
right
i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting
but i dont know
somehow i dont have the time anymore
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they sit down and the next thing they pull out of their bags their most recent needle craft
really
and in $unc$december everyone was doing stockings these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings
uh-huh
gosh
yeah
those take a lot of time
yes
i only can do things that are pretty fast because we just got our baby last year
and i just dont have the patience to just do something
is this your first baby
uh-huh
have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets
i crocheted an afghan for our bed
thats the only thing
and i did a quilt
ive done a quilt for our baby
and ive done a quilt for our bed
but
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself
or how did you make a quilt
our babys quilt it was like the design
i just went around the design in the quilt
uh-huh
i didnt piece it or anything like that
but
but you actually hand quilted it yourself
uh-huh
and
did you need a loom
or were you a-
was it small enough that you could just hold it
i put it on the quilting frame
are you familiar with that
uh-huh
yeah
okay
but again my mother back in $unc$indiana
we had a quilting frame in our basement
and she would quilt whole quilts by herself
my $unc$god
yes
which
i was always amazed
i have $unc$one of them
but to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that its a tremendous amount of work
i havent done tons of them
but i used to do more before we got our baby
but
you think children
you can use crafts to make wonderful things for children
uh-huh
i think when babies
i think afghans and the crocheted little sweaters are wonderful
and theyll wear them
yes
exactly
once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them
$unc$one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then cut out a little pattern from some material like flowers or something and make a design or a little arrangement or something on the shirt and fuse it on with $unc$heat and $unc$bond or whatever and then paint around it
and i usually sew around the flower whatever first
and then i paint around it
so you cant see the stitching as much
does that make sense to you
so
yes
i think its very clever
its funny that you said
for $unc$christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us a beautiful $unc$christmas design
and they were matching
and they were lovely
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didnt do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it
sure
uh-huh
really
so i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back
and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges
oh
and it was salvageable
and i
but its
so im familiar with that
but i think youre very clever to sew around the edges
i think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges
yeah
someone told me that they had done it both ways
and after hearing that i always sewed it on a loose zigzag even helps
and
okay
how do you just figure
it depends upon our weather here
today was a beautiful day
it was like $unc$summer day
it was $unc$seventy degrees
so i dressed in a light weight skirt
wow
its a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it
uh-huh
because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews
and so i had to dress up anyway
and then i wore heels
uh-huh
but when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately very often wear pants and boots
oh
how do you dress
im going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was working at now
okay
when i was a teacher in $unc$utah i would generally wear dresses and heels and things like that
uh-huh
and even when it rained and snowed i just braved it
and i wore heels anyway
yeah
and
i can see
ive been a teacher so has my daughter
and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring
i know
it might kill you to go up and walk up to the door
thats right
but youre going to look nice for the kids
thats right
and it always makes you feel like youre a bigger person than the kids right
yeah
i need all the height i can get
yeah
i do too
so to be taller than some of the boys in the older grades i had to wear heels
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
we too
if it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots
but then i would change into heels as soon as i got to my desk
uh-huh
so
of course we wear an unlined boots
it has a heel on it
theyre the kind of boots that i wear to work
and we wear them
theyre a leather boot that you wear
and as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel
oh
and we wear them a lot with shirts and things
its kind of a
i cant say constant down here in $unc$texas that you wear these boots
theyre not a cowboy boot
but theyre just a real pretty boot
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain
oh
as i have a private high school that i run here when im interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels and look like im a business person because the children will tease about wheres your motorcycle if you wear boots too often
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
of course you probably wear coats a lot
yeah
the first $unc$two years i was in a room where they didnt heat it
so i did
my goodness
so then you had to
yeah
and then the third year we got heating
so it was nice
yes
then things improved right
right
uh-huh
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot
thats nice
and thats very seldom
it depends upon our winter
we have a few days you might wear a winter coat
but most of the time you can wear a sweater
and we just dont wear coats much
we often laugh about even when it turns chilly
were wearing something lightweight or no jacket because were so used to running around like that
uh-huh
nice
its really different
lets put it that way
are you not teaching anymore
no
we moved to $unc$iowa
and im working at a day care right now
i see
and so the way i dress is really different because im working in the nursery room with kids from $unc$six months to like $unc$twenty months
so you dont wear heels anymore ill bet
yeah
i wear tennis shoes and jeans and things that are sort of
yeah
uh-huh
more practical
not
yes
it doesnt matter if i have to wash it a $unc$hundred times or something
when you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that
yeah
but i never wore jeans because i thought that was too casual
yeah
for
i know that some of the schools they have country western day or something like that $unc$one or tacky day
and i always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too
yeah
really
its all right for the students
they look tacky a lot
but i didnt think teachers should
yeah
thats how i feel too
yeah
do you like $unc$iowa
theres some good things about it
but ive seen a lot of things im not used to yet
where did you live before
we lived in $unc$utah before
and i grew up in $unc$california
thats quite a change from $unc$california to $unc$utah
what is your favorite kind of music
i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be classical music
same here
really
yeah
what type of music do you like in the classical area
or what era do you like the most
i guess i like a wide range everything from $unc$baroque through at least some modern music
uh-huh
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera
weve been sort of opera fans for a few years now
do you go to the operas that they sing $unc$english or go to the ones that they sing other languages
we generally
the places weve gone they sing in the original languages
uh-huh
like the $unc$dallas opera here normally does i guess
uh-huh
i havent gotten into that too much because if i dont know the story line and i dont speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending whats going on
$unc$one thing thats helped us a lot is that you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape
uh-huh
and so we have quite a collection of those
and you watch them at home
and they have subtitles
so you figure out whats going on after a while
and then you can enjoy it in the theater
oh
but the $unc$dallas opera now has super titles on all their performances i think
what is that
they give an $unc$english translation on a screen up above the stage
i didnt know that
yeah
that can help people like me
in fact they even do that for operas sung in $unc$english because it is hard to understand the words sometimes
i can understand that
so id say $unc$vivaldi is probably my favorite composer
yeah
i really like $unc$vivaldi
hes definitely $unc$one of the top of that era
yeah
i like $unc$baroque music
i like full body music with brass and winds woodwinds instruments
uh-huh
course i like also string instruments
and i have $unc$two string instrument players
both my sons play string instruments
$unc$one plays the cello
and the other $unc$one plays the viola
oh
so i get to go to at least $unc$four or $unc$five concerts a year
uh-huh
how old are they
$unc$one is $unc$thirteen and $unc$one is $unc$eleven
so theyre doing this in school or what
yes
uh-huh
yes
youve got half a string quartet there
yeah
were on our way
yeah
so i try to enjoy all of it
since you seem to like italian music have you ever gotten into $unc$gabrielli or anybody there in that era the period actually before $unc$vivaldi i guess
a little bit
but a lot of the music i dont know about as far as the titles
and i have to listen to it and figure out what im listening to
uh-huh
i do belong to a $unc$musical $unc$heritage $unc$society
yes
uh-huh
do you belong to that
no
i dont
but i think i know what it is
isnt that a
cant you get records through that or something recordings
you can get recordings
they know have them on compact disc or cassettes or l p
uh-huh
and they do a lot of original recordings themselves
yes
yeah
i think
but they also go to the different composers or the different i guess
what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the conductors
yes
right
yeah
they go to conductors
and they actually have them perform the music
and they record it
so theyre actually commissioned performances
sure
a lot of them are
uh-huh
or they will find out when theyre performing
and they will record the music at that time
and so it is high quality grade music
and of course now they also have a jazz section
and they also have a more contemporary and american composer section
uh-huh
i had heard good things about the $unc$music $unc$heritage $unc$society
but if i get involved in $unc$one of those things i end up spending all my money on music
yeah
you can control it
i almost bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the $unc$columbia $unc$record $unc$club many years ago
really
yeah
my roommate signed me up
he got a bonus record
and i got a lot of bills
i see
so we have to watch that
thats good
do you play any instrument yourself
yes
i play guitar and early years played saxophone
okay
my favorite show is $unc$masterpiece theatre
and it has been for a long time
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it
do you by any chance
yes
you do!
yes
very much
wouldnt you know
as a matter of fact i prefer public television
uh-huh
and i particularly enjoy the english comedies and the english mysteries
yeah
yeah
i watch mysteries too
is that what youre referring to
yes
okay
yeah
that is good
i like
do you read
vociferously
okay
thats the reason why i like both of those programs is because theyre kind of based on books
yes
and the plots are more challenging than the sitcoms of regular t v
unfortunately for us at least here in the $unc$united $unc$states the only access we have to that of course is public television
yeah
im not a great television watcher in any respect
but the watching
what i do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television
any kind of
i also am very fond of great performances in that regard
uh-huh
yeah
me too
but
did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf
no
that was a scream
no
no
as a matter of fact $unc$turner $unc$broadcasting has been broadcasting all of the $unc$james $unc$bond movies every night this week
uh-huh
really
so i have concentrated on watching $unc$james $unc$bond movies this week
i used to like him too
he was my hero
in fact i like $unc$sean $unc$connery to this day
theyre showing live and let die at this moment
yeah
and it is the first appearance of $unc$roger $unc$moore as double $unc$oh $unc$seven
yeah
he can never cut it
no
no
thats true
i was just thinking that today he did in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies
yeah
yeah
yeah
he does
whereas $unc$sean $unc$connery has maintained the how would you ruddy look
uh-huh
yeah
i liked his accent too
and he can even be in movies that are not sexually oriented
and he still comes off great
when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something
he is
yeah
he had my vote double
the man is $unc$sixty-two years old
i dont care
but otherwise we
with $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s and so forth
and i particularly enjoy i dont know whether youve had a chance to watch it on $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s but the series yes minister
yeah
whats that about
that was about the $unc$interior $unc$minister
it was a comedy
yeah
yeah
the $unc$interior $unc$minister in $unc$england with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that
uh-huh
right
right
ive seen it several times
its a scream
but i have to go to bed
i have to get up and work the next morning
i wish theyd put those
thats why i say did you stay up late to watch this red dwarf
it came on after $unc$doctor $unc$who on $unc$saturday nights here at least
uh-huh
and it should
of course i li-
really it was
i dont think they should show it during prime time
but still it was funny
yeah
yeah
i know
im not much of a television watcher
i read as i said quite a bit
uh-huh
i read about $unc$two or $unc$three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff
yeah
what do you do
what kind of work do you do
im a $unc$payroll $unc$clerk
just an accounting clerk
at $unc$t $unc$i
no
i have a friend who works for $unc$t $unc$i
and i work for a tire service here in
i see
im from $unc$dallas
uh-huh
the last $unc$two people who have called both worked for $unc$t $unc$i
and i just wondered
yeah
yeah
it could be $unc$t $unc$i i think probably are participating more than anybody else
but i needed the money
this is $unc$five bucks here
i think thats something we all ca-
yeah
really
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
no
i work for $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e in $unc$maryland
really
yes
how did you hear
were not even supposed to be talking about this though are we
i guess not
how did i hear about it
i work
they are gathering a data base for voice processing
uh-huh
and thats my field of work also
oh!
so i know the people at $unc$t $unc$i who are doing this
and i heard about it
so i called them and asked if i could participate and send in the forms $unc$et $unc$cetera and so forth
oh
right
we could go back to television shows
speaking of public tv have you caught any of this series on the $unc$bible
yes
i have
ive heard that its coming out with the idea that the bibles not true
no
thats
you could interpret it that way
uh-huh
i think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the $unc$bible itself after what is it the $unc$king $unc$james $unc$version when the committee wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in $unc$greek
yeah
for example in $unc$greek there are $unc$seven different words for love
right
okay
so you can have
theres $unc$one word for love of your brother $unc$one word for love of your wife $unc$one word for love of your father and that sort of thing
so those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the $unc$bible now and what its at
uh-huh
so thats
you can look at it as though they are saying its not true
but theres too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time that are available to deny that at least the majority of it is true
yeah
so it depends on how you look at it
yeah
you can look at it
if you want to say that its proven that it isnt true then you can very much look at it that way
i guess if youre looking for that youre
yeah
you can interpret the t v show in the same way that you can interpret the $unc$bible
that
uh-huh
really
but as far as that goes we at least agree on what we enjoy
yeah
thats right
but i dont know if there is a time limit on this so
yeah
surely weve made it
i think so too
lets just
its been very pleasant talking to you
it was very nice talking to you
and have a good evening
you too
good night!
bye-bye
$unc$robert what substances do you think are the most likely causes of air pollution
gee
i dont
i guess its the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust
they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that
right
i believe them
but im not a chemist
do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial areas factories and so on
i dont really know
i grew up in $unc$los $unc$angeles and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution
i was going to say
so you understand smog
i understand it very well
and in fact i was a private pilot there
uh-huh
and i can remember etched clearly in my mind flying and coming up above the smog layer at about $unc$three $unc$thousand feet and looking back down and really being unbelieving at what looked like a
wow
it just looked liked peanut butter
my word
thick and brown and so on
and that was a few years ago
this was quite a few years ago
this was in the $unc$nineteen sixties
i wonder if its any better now because $unc$california has such strict rules about emissions and so on
people say that it is somewhat better
right
i dont know if you heard about the recent legislation in $unc$colorado against a power company thats actually on $unc$indian land i believe
but it has been ruled against regarding air pollution because they think that its causing terrible smog over the $unc$grand $unc$canyon and particularly in the winter months
so they
it was a landmark case because its unusual to
i can
they were talking about shutting it down if it didnt comply and so on
did it burn coal
i dont know that
the information is $unc$one of those wire services kind of pieces of news
so its hard
i never did see the full story
so i dont know
yeah
but they said that it really caused so much smog over the $unc$grand $unc$canyon in the winter months that they couldnt do the piloting the helicopter trips and that sort of thing which would be horrible because theres nothing
yeah
thats such a spectacle
it would be a shame to ruin it
yeah
what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem
i dont know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals maybe just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing
right
apart from that i dont know what we can do as individuals
what do you think we can do
uh-huh
you think its more to society
i guess i kind of agree there
i
on an individual basis there isnt a lot we can do about a lot of things
but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can force government that we elect to deal more seriously with it
yeah
and i do think that we have a responsibility there
i must admit im not always real politically active
but i do think that $unc$congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards
yeah
and its brought the
they really listen to
the lobbyist and the car manufacturing companies have really pushed
they
all those restrictions are really too hard
we cant quite make that go
and they dont
and then we still live with air pollution
yeah
so i suspect that thats $unc$one thing that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators
but as a society i think we can do more
and thats probably how we ought to do it being individually responsible in order to be group responsible
yeah
i guess im to the point where im cynical enough that i really dont believe anything will happen unless theres something economically justifiable about it
right
and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else that well spend the money thats necessary to get rid of the source of it
uh-huh
i suspect that theres going to have to be a lot of pressure come to bear on the companies that deal with it
and probably the only way that can happen is for governments to realize that they have to pay if companies dont
yeah
and i dont know how long that will take
people also have to realize they cant have their cake and eat it
so if you dont want to burn coal for power how about nuclear energy
sure
we dont want that either
exactly
yeah
right
how about investing in the sun
nobody wants to pay $unc$twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour i dont think
right
i probably wouldnt mind if it really came down to it
its just the same thing with the gasoline
now is a wonderful time to smack a $unc$fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we dont run into the kind of problems we recently had
yes
yes
yes
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent
and they dont want to pay for it
so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war
yes
wha-
however it might have had other causes
certainly oil was a big factor
certainly
yes
and i think thats probably going to happen with such things as air pollution when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles then maybe well have a little bit of help
yeah
do you have any air pollution in your area
theres not really a lot here in $unc$raleigh
once in a while well get some
i think it kind of washes down from your area $unc$linda
no
thats what they
youre talking about from the middle states that have more factories and so on
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats what they say
but its not very usual
and certainly we dont have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities
yeah
we really dont have that either
i lived in this area for about $unc$twenty-five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level particularly in the summer when it gets hot and you have that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air usually they say caused by exhaust
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
it seems to me that im more uncomfortable
and my eyes sting more and so on and so on
so i suspect that its an ever growing problem
yeah
i suspect that weve probably covered everything that we need to here
right
i think weve given them about $unc$seven minutes according to my watch
it was nice talking to you
and i enjoyed the conversation
so did i
bye bye
bye
okay
my favorite probably all time t v show is star trek
and i would it like that
i like the adventure of it and the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then i the
they have a new one now
the star trek the next generation which its an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and doing new things and finding out about different people
right
and ive always liked that show probably the very best
uh-huh
i think ive actually seen a number of star treks $unc$one way or another over the years although i never watched it regularly
im certainly acquainted with the characters
uh-huh
and then ive seen some of the star trek movies
yeah
those
the movies are good too
and i guess most of the shows i like are kind of along the same line because theyre all adventure
uh-huh
when i started thinking about this those are some of my favorite shows $unc$mcgyver because its only $unc$one person there instead of a cast of people
uh-huh
but hes always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden hes got a hang glider
and
i dont think ive even heard of that show
you havent
its called $unc$mcgyver
uh-huh
and what is he
hes like a semigovernment type agent who works for the $unc$phoenix $unc$foundation supposedly
uh-huh
and his big thing is that he can take little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things
he took a car battery and some wire and $unc$two washers $unc$one time and made a welder
uh-huh
so he does all kinds of strange things like that
great
$unc$boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a $unc$seven $unc$forty-seven out of it
yeah
see what we can come up with
do you like the news shows $unc$twenty $unc$twenty $unc$sixty minutes those kind of things
i used to watch $unc$sixty minutes as a matter of fact
and i used to like the show very much
uh-huh
but unfortunately i find getting rid of your t v set you do throw out some of the baby with the bath water
some of the little things
yeah
and i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it
i could just sit mindlessly in front of a t v set for hours
and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic
if i didnt get the booze out of the house i was going to drink
oh
i guess i havent ever had any trouble with that
i have my favorite shows
and i usually make time in my day or my week to watch those
yeah
but for the most part i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when theyre up
yeah
yeah
because theyre
i guess that falls
and $unc$one of my other favorite shows is $unc$sesame $unc$street because of the kids
i like that real well
right
when my kids were little i did have a t v set
and i did watch a lot of $unc$sesame $unc$street and a lot of electric company as well
i dont think they have that on anymore
that would be a shame
i havent seen the electric company in a long time
i remember it when i was younger catching it on $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s
but i dont think they show
it must be in
maybe its in
if it was in repeats
but theyre not making new ones
huh
i havent seen it in a long time
but $unc$sesame $unc$street is still really good
yeah
how about $unc$mister $unc$rogers
is he still around
yes
yeah
they still show $unc$mister $unc$rogers
i dont think hes making new ones
but they repeat all the old ones
i see
i see
so thats still a real good show too
i
that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the t v on
uh-huh
$unc$sesame street comes on from $unc$nine to $unc$ten which is a good time
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go
so its
the timing of it is good besides whats on
right
i figure your children are preschool
yes
i have $unc$two little ones
yeah
so they like that
yeah
i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon
they come on both
they come on from $unc$nine to $unc$ten and then from $unc$five to $unc$six
uh-huh
okay
they just repeat over again which is also
okay
another thing thats good about it
when it comes on right in the dinner hour i can feel i can let them sit in front of the t v and watch
and theyre watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot
yeah
yeah
with little kids the t v set really is a
i used it as a pacifier
yeah
im not sure it was that great for my children
but they turned out okay
so
it didnt hurt them any
yeah
some shows are good for
i think some
star trek i
for the imagination of it all
the idea i think thats $unc$one of the things i like about star trek
uh-huh
and is the
for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff
i dont let my little ones watch it
but the imagination of look what we can do in the future perhaps this will be possible that kind of thing
yeah
yeah
okay
i think weve covered most of my favorite t v shows
im trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at $unc$one time
lets see how about man from $unc$uncle
i do seem to reme-
is that the $unc$one where he always got this tape recording that self-destructed
thats mission impossible
mission
thats right
mission impossible
yeah
i used to watch that
in fact i can still remember a couple of those
they were
i thought those were very good
yeah
they always have
ive seen some of them on repeats
yeah
that
they always had a good plot
it kind of kept you guessing on what was going to happen next
right
right
you
how theyre going get out of their latest scrape
yeah
i do remember that
and i remember as a kid my parents watching the $unc$ed $unc$sullivan show
that was really the big deal in our household was the $unc$ed $unc$sullivan show
yeah
every $unc$saturday night
yeah
i guess it was a $unc$saturday night
and i went to see the movie the $unc$doors a couple of days ago
and they had this scene portraying the doors appearance on the $unc$ed $unc$sullivan show
they even had somebody portraying $unc$ed $unc$sullivan
and it was very very funny
i think it was the funniest part of that movie
i dont know
was there any
i remember the $unc$milton $unc$berle show even
i was
ye-
im not old enough to recall that one
i guess i have to admit that i am
my t v viewing started sort of mid-sixties
so
i see
my folks
im not even sure if we had $unc$one when i was really little
that may be why bu-
they probably didnt have a t v until i got to be grade school or so
yeah
and the shows that i like now they wouldnt let me watch
i had to catch them all on repeats
like star trek they thought that was much too violent for small children
so
i ended up watching a lot of these things on repeats in the afternoons or something
yeah
thats interesting
i think its interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv
people were just as violent before t v was invented maybe even more so
yeah
but i guess thats a different topic
isnt it
probably so
i think thats about covered it for me
so i think ill say good-bye
and well talk another time perhaps
yeah
it was nice talking to you
tell me where youre calling from
im calling from $unc$garland $unc$texas
$unc$garland $unc$texas
uh-huh
all right
im in $unc$nor-
where are you from
im in $unc$raleigh $unc$north $unc$carolina
my goodness
i didnt know they did it long distance
yeah
i hope theyre trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different dialects
yes
it was nice talking to you
same here
bye-bye
bye-bye
the last movie that i saw
i dont go to that many
so ill just have to talk about the ones that i went to see
but it was awakenings with $unc$robin $unc$williams and $unc$peter $unc$deniro
okay
yes
uh-huh
have you seen it
no
unfortunately i havent
i heard its really good
but
it is
i just have to take my hat off to $unc$peter $unc$deniro
uh-huh
he is $unc$one of the best actors ive ever seen
its
theres a point where
the show is about these catatonic type people that
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living more or less
but it wears off
uh-huh
and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic
it starts off with like a tic
uh-huh
and then it gets to where he cant control his movements at all
and it was just so realistic
the way you have to just keep reminding yourself that hes an actor
uh-huh
what is
$unc$robin $unc$williams does he have a funny part in it
no
it was very se-
how does he do serious
hes good
hes talented
boy he is
ive only seen him in funny stuff
and so
i know
me too
but what was that show $unc$garf-
i want to say $unc$garfield
but that wasnt it
yeah
the world according to $unc$garp
yeah
the $unc$world $unc$according to $unc$garp
he wasnt always funny in that show was he
i didnt see the movie
i read the book
but i
i did too
thats why i was thinking it couldnt be just a totally funny part
yeah
in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it
so
yeah
right
yeah
what have you seen
i think the last movie that we went out to see was dances with wolves
i saw it
good
weve both seen $unc$one
did you cry through it
yes
the whole way
it was telling a friend i said i only cried twice
but each was about half an hour long
where did you cry
lets see
each time that i thought that the $unc$indians were going to get killed i cried
uh-huh
i cried the first time when the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and i think from there on all the way through the movie
lets see what else did it what other parts
i cant remember any of the other parts right off now
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed
we-
i dont remember when the horse got killed
th-
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him
yeah
and then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards
uh-huh
and that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone
yeah
you can tell im an animal lover
you can hear my dog
unfortunately we dont have any animals
so
yeah
it was a beautiful story
it really was
it
there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
what did you think about the buffalo scenes
i thought it was awful and so graphic
that was
yeah
i hadnt even imagined it
i think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
uh-huh
i had a friend who had fixed some buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie
of course they raise them now to eat
uh-huh
yeah
its not
but we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that
uh-huh
at least you know that it wasnt same situation that the buffalo died in
no
it wasnt
i thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful
that was great
yeah
and there were so many of them
i didnt know that that many buffaloes alive much less in $unc$one place
yeah
really
that was pretty
and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you could follow this beaten down path
yeah
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
i wonder how they kept up with them though
it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast
i know
i guess they graze though
that wouldnt be a problem
yeah
yeah
have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie
no
huh-uh
it was
they tried to keep it very close to real
uh-huh
$unc$kevin $unc$costner did all of his own scenes
and they had to teach a wolf how to howl
oh
thats the part they had trouble finding was wolves
i guess theyre just not domesticated
or
yeah
what
they just dont howl that much anymore
i could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off
and thats all theyd have to do
yeah
thats funny
i think weve made it
is that $unc$five minutes
is that
i dont know
is it $unc$five or $unc$three
okay
im not sure
im not either
okay
i think weve done okay though
okay
me too
thank you for calling
thank you
and i hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
yeah
you too
bye bye
bye bye
okay
okay
i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
okay
credit cards boy thats an easy topic
yes
isnt it
it is
its $unc$one we all hold dear and near im sure
yes
yes
i guess ive had some good experience and some bad experience with them
yeah
most of mines been pretty good although i guess im like a lot of other people now
im trying to pay off my credit cards
and ive done pretty good at it
yeah
uh-huh
i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want not need want
yeah
uh-huh
there is a big difference
theres a big difference there
yeah
yeah
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
yeah
yeah
i do that
i do that
but like i said the rest of them ive been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas
uh-huh
its too easy to run into the gas station
it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way
and
uh-huh
at least thats for me
yeah
yeah
yeah
but yeah
ive talked to some whos really had some bad experience
and kind of knock on wood i havent yet not bad
yeah
thats
im just shocked at the end of the month to see what damage i have did
but i try to keep it pretty reasonable
yeah
yeah
ive been pretty lucky in that respect
like i say ive been trying to not charge except for emergencies
uh-huh
but i havent really had any bad problems with credit cards
theres
they have wonderful features
theyre there when you need them like in emergencies or whatever
yeah
yeah
and then they have bad drawbacks too high interest
yeah
its awfully easy
its like paying twice
thats true
thats true
yes
so
i try to
i did switch to $unc$one sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest compared to some of the other ones
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and you dont have an annual fee there
and that helps
yes
we used to have several
but right now were just more or less at $unc$american $unc$express
uh-huh
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
yeah
thats $unc$one way to do it because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying ill just pay on it this month
yeah
pay $unc$fifteen
yeah
and
yes
i know
yeah
yeah
and when you pay $unc$fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
takes a long time
thats right
it sure does
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax thats
uh-huh
of course its been going down for a number of years
but this is the last year you can take anything
so
uh-huh
yeah
ive enjoyed talking to you
ive enjoyed talking to you
and maybe well get to talk again
okay
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
i can tell you pretty much my $unc$two favorite shows
okay
and they kind of are in different spectrums i think
$unc$one of them is quantum leap
okay
and the other $unc$one is night court
and i think theyre real different
i dont think they have anything in common
quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way i guess
but mostly its kind of science fiction
and its adventure and things like that
uh-huh
and then night court is just pure weird fun
its nothing serious about it at all
so i dont know why the $unc$two of them happen to be my $unc$two favorite shows
but thats the way it is
so
its funny that those are my husbands $unc$two favorite shows too
and i enjoy watching both of them
but i used to didnt like night court
uh-huh
and i
and the only reason i think i like it now is because ive seen it so much
and im involved with the characters
but i used to think $unc$dan $unc$fielding was just too vulgar and too crude for me
he is
and i told my husband thats the whole point
but
yeah
thats right
i just
its
i find him degrading at times
i guess that is the point
but sometimes it just
they really have changed him though
if youve watched it this season he still is in his own way degrading and everything
but hes involved in that charity
and its taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has
in fact there was $unc$one show that he even turned down a date with some beautiful woman just because his mind was on the ozone layer and global warming and all this other kind of stuff
oh
and he was too depressed to
so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever
but
i think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character
i havent watched
which of course he needed
yeah
i think so
which in quantum leap you get
even though the person is involved in so many other peoples lives you still see a real person in those situations
hes doing amazing things
uh-huh
but hes doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do
right
right
thats a good point
and i think thats
i like that
what do you consider your favorite shows
i think my favorite show is $unc$hunter
okay
and i like the old series better when $unc$dede was in there
$unc$dede
yeah
yeah
i agree
and then the blond that they took out the $unc$one that got killed
yeah
i cant remember what her name is
but is
yeah
i didnt enjoy her
i
she was too much of a opposite of $unc$dede
and i think thats what they try to do
but i think we wanted to see $unc$dede there or somebody like her
uh-huh
but i read an article in $unc$t $unc$v $unc$guide about $unc$hunter and about his $unc$three girls whatever you want to call them
uh-huh
and they say that there was a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use
the second lady
yeah
the second one the blond
uh-huh
yeah
if you think about it they didnt really interact hardly at all
they didnt
they were never partners
yeah
she would go her way
and he would do his
yeah
and i think thats what i didnt like
and even at the beginning $unc$dede and $unc$hunter would decide that $unc$one of them would go do this while the other one would go this
but it seemed like it was almost $unc$two different organizations
uh-huh
$unc$hunter was the boss
and this other girl was not
and youre wondering when did this happen
right
so yeah
i kind of agree with that
and i like the new lady better
but id just as soon that they didnt have the romance there
id just as soon have the police story without all the romance
im afraid thats what they really wanted to do
yeah
i think most shows were doing that
and then they went away from it
uh-huh
and now theyre starting to go back to it
and maybe thats what the public wants
i dont know
but i like the cut and dry solve the mystery
and thats what i always enjoyed about it
yeah
there was that spark between $unc$dede and $unc$hunter for a while
yeah
but they started it
and then theyd pull it back
and theyd start it and pull it back
and that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up whether it was going to where theyre going to be real close or whether theyre just going to be partners
uh-huh
and that i kind of thought was good
but its i guess
you always kind of sit there
and you see these $unc$two people together
and you always wonder why they dont get together or whatever
yeah
and so i guess thats what they decide to do
just go ahead and quit the wondering
yeah
and
but its always been a formula for t v that the $unc$two main stars get married that the show ends up dying
yeah
a good example of this is probabl-
maybe its not a good example
ive been watching $unc$nickelodeon all last week because they had what they called maximum $unc$smart
they had get $unc$smart for $unc$ten hours a day from $unc$seven oclock at night or until $unc$five oclock the next morning all the get $unc$smart episodes you could ever see
oh
the last day all they did was the last season to where the $unc$two of them got married
uh-huh
and that was the killer
the series died right after that because
i was going to say i didnt ever watch moonlighting
go ahead
but i heard thats what killed it
uh-huh
same thing
that interplay died when they got married
and so the show died
yeah
the
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married
uh-huh
the minute they get married everythings supposed to be cut and dried
and of course another $unc$one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters personalities especially after they get married
right
halfway through
yeah
couple of examples would be like i said this $unc$one about $unc$get $unc$well $unc$smart the female character $unc$barbara $unc$feldon
uh-huh
she had been at the beginning the intelligent one the $unc$one who always solved the things and figured out and kept $unc$max from getting real messed up
in short whenever they got married she got dingy
oh
why would they do that
yeah
it made no sense
im guess its falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows
unfortunately thats probably true
yeah
which kind of
like in the big soap opera shows which i dont enjoy because of that
but
do you watch what is that show whos the boss
thats on $unc$tuesday nights i think
ive seen it before
but i dont watch it regularly
yeah
i hardly ever watch it
usually $unc$tuesday nights im out
so
but as ive seen it theyve done sort of the same thing to where they started to let them get together
and then they pulled them apart
uh-huh
and i think theyre thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them get together then you lose part of what the shows all about
uh-huh
so i always thought that was kind of weird
yeah
its funny how we romanticize people
uh-huh
for instance where as the teenager you romanticize a rock star
but when he gets married then you dont care any more or something like that
right
and i think its the same with your characters on t v
do you think thats why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret or at least they keep it quiet
probably
yeah
i know it affected me when i was younger
im not into rock stars too much lately
yeah
but
no
like $unc$madonna and $unc$sean $unc$penn
i dont particularly like either $unc$one of them
uh-huh
but their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together
yeah
or at least thats the way i look at it
uh-huh
so i dont know
it would have been hard
wouldnt it
yeah
i would think so
i just the publicity in and of itself much less the
when you get married youve got relationship to develop in the first place
so having $unc$twenty $unc$million people watch you do that
yeah
its
they wouldnt be easy
yeah
thats kind of interesting
yeah
i guess thats about all we need to do isnt it
yeah
i think weve covered our time
its been good talking to you
yeah
it has been $unc$becky
i really appreciate it
youre the first man ive talked to
everyone else has been a female
so this is a change
i think ive
youre the second female ive talked to
youve had a little bit of variety
yeah
its kind of nice
okay
thanks so much
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
like i was saying burlingtons crime it doesnt involve children
and what you see on the t v in $unc$washington and $unc$new $unc$york
so what i believe the people want
the subject is big city crime which is something that i dont have any first hand experiences about
but i have concerns
and i have a few ideas of how to combat it
uh-huh
i dont think ideally you need money to do everything
so thats $unc$one thing
uh-huh
thats crime that you cant fight it if you need that money
so
right
yeah
when we lived in $unc$san $unc$antonio
i grew up around $unc$san $unc$antonio
and its always been a very large city and increasingly growing
its has kind of the split population
theres a lot of retired military individuals that live there
and then theres a very large $unc$hispanic population there
and the $unc$one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is $unc$hispanic gang crime in the city
and that has been the worse thing that weve seen happening
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the retired peoples community
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods
the majority of the actual gang crimes like the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape and car crime
theres a very high percentage of car theft
and $unc$san antonios not far from the border to $unc$mexico
so a lot of the cars go to shops
and they take them apart
and a lot of them go over the border especially like $unc$mercedes
a lot of those in the $unc$z cars the $unc$datsun cars end up over the border
and
so thats a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up
very much so
very much so
in fact for a while there if you were to come to a stop light they had a rash of when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up
so now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while theyre in the car until they get down there
and once youve reached the river walk area which is the tourist area its usually pretty safe during the day if youre just kind of cautious and dont go down the back streets or alleys or alone
if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops its very nice
but at evening again they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice
but you dont want to get off the beaten track
theres a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight
and so you dont want to get caught in the parking garage alone
it sounds like $unc$san $unc$juan $unc$puerto $unc$rico
we were there just for a lay over
uh-huh
and it wasnt a lay over
we were staying at the other end of the island
and we drove into $unc$san $unc$juan to catch our plane
uh-huh
it was at night
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach
and they look at you crazy
uh-huh
you dont go on the beach
uh-huh
its a big tourist town
dont people go for a walk on the beach at night
and they said no
its very safe in the daytime
uh-huh
but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary and get off the beach
its just so sad
it is just really so sad
it is just really so sad because you cant enjoy anything any more
in $unc$san $unc$antonio i dont know what the answer is
education i think is a lot of it
so many of the kids are drop outs
theres a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives
they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels
i think education helps a little bit there
then again i dont know really what steps there are that they
what they say they try to do is to get the kids early and young
uh-huh
and what we have here in $unc$burlington which it doesnt cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids
uh-huh
uh-huh
they set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow
they have a big brother big sister program
they have bottle drives
they have cleanup outings
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer
and they have gyms open
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them
uh-huh
but again you need that $unc$one on $unc$one like a big brother trying to tell him hey stay in school
itll get better
so that your mom doesnt have a job
uh-huh
and she doesnt work
you dont know
you can be better than that
you dont have to live for a street life
uh-huh
but
uh-huh
thats good that sounds like theyve got a lot going on there
yeah
but its so cheap they dont have a problem here
they can deal with that scale
uh-huh
they might have $unc$five $unc$hundred troubled youths
uh-huh
when you have $unc$five $unc$thousand troubled youths plus when youre getting into the kids now its $unc$twelve years old
and theyre selling drugs
uh-huh
and theyve got a $unc$fifteen year old thats their boss that is carrying a gun
uh-huh
uh-huh
its the morals of the people which i guess everybodys responsible for the society
but if i had a child that did things so bad
its not they dont care about anybody
uh-huh
these people theyre stealing from theyre just the big bad rich guy
uh-huh
and we dont have it
so we deserve it
and we should take it
uh-huh
yeah
i dont know how you combat that
i dont know where you start with a lot of these kids
so many of them all they see is just the gangs
yes
and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they dont have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school
i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too
were talking these kids are $unc$fourteen years old
yeah
the parents might be $unc$thirty years old
uh-huh
and im $unc$thirty years old
and im kind of irresponsible
but i have the morals that keep me from
if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldnt do it in front of my child
these people they bring their $unc$johns home
and they bring their drugs home
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
uh-huh
its just that they have absolutely no morals
uh-huh
and its really sad
and i dont know how you combat that
i rea-
i dont know what the answer is to that problem
but i like your idea of education
uh-huh
if the parents arent supplying it theyve got to get it from someone else from the schools
uh-huh
yeah
and what do those kids do
they get it at school and come home
what do they do then
i feel for them
i dont know how to make it better for them
or because they cant remove themselves
they cant just leave and say okay its not acceptable
im leaving the big city $unc$mom
and im going off
when theyre $unc$ten they have to live in it
yeah
its really sad
if they did have a big brother big sister program
those people trying to help the kids
the parents might have hostilities towards them like youre judging us
right
i think so
and
and im not good enough to raise my child which basically is true
uh-huh
its
im glad i dont live in a big city not just because i wouldnt feel safe
uh-huh
yeah
its just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i dont see
yeah
and i might see it on a $unc$sixty $unc$minutes special
uh-huh
no
in $unc$san $unc$antonio it was every day
it was just a matter of who was shot that night
i know it
but $unc$san $unc$antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not
they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
uh-huh
yeah
but theres a lot of them
but any big city has a bad section
its very prevalent
a lot of the crime is very prevalent
yes
theyre very bold it seems
uh-huh
very much
when we moved here to $unc$monterrey it was a big change because its such a small community
were just above $unc$carmel
and theres hardly
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here
and those that arent
theres $unc$celinas which is about a $unc$fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers
and theres a lot of crime there migrant hispanic farm workers people that are down and out
and they all seem to congregate in $unc$celinas not so much here in $unc$monterrey
so its pretty quiet
we walk the streets at night
and people run in the park
and youre just
have your normal smarts about you then you really dont have to worry
or
really
even in the worst crime areas in $unc$burlington
i can walk the streets
i wouldnt
if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house
uh-huh
so you wouldnt get confronted or anything
right
but i dont think you would
someone might grab you mess around with you
but theyre not going to grab you steal your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
uh-huh
yeah
thats what youre going to have to expect that to happen
people are just totally unfeeling
uh-huh
i didnt know that about $unc$burlington
ill have to keep that in mind
okay
lets see
i believe in the trial by jury
i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for payoffs briberies unfairness one-sidedness all those kinds of things
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a $unc$hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
i really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory
i think thats a good way to do it
thats about all
i think basically were in a lot of agreement in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs some kind of legal definition
uh-huh
but for anything involving that trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
uh-huh
but there should be with our overworked judicial system
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of not having to take everything before a full court
maybe there ought to be some kind of
isnt there a type of word called a jury duty now
uh-huh
really
and maybe instead of just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do maybe we should commit to spend a week
and during that week youre kind of an $unc$ad $unc$hoc lets hear about it group of i dont know $unc$twenty-five instead of $unc$twelve
uh-huh
and each case is presented to that group of $unc$twenty-five
and those cases are lesser degrees of magnitude
the guy was caught burgling
and he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught
right
that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say your pleasure your honor
and theres not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
yeah
but the way our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
right
i just think our system is overworked
and were starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial
yeah
thats a good idea
maybe this pre group of people could decide where they could go from there
do they need a big lengthy $unc$twelve person jury
or do they need a $unc$six person jury or those kinds of things
and the seriousness of it
how
is this open and shut like you were saying
or do you need somebody to go off for $unc$three months and try to figure out what really happened a jury like that
we
they could be a good idea to
that could work
kind of off what weve been talking about here i believe that weve become almost a litigious society where everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we dont need to do that
yeah
uh-huh
maybe instead of being so quick to sue you if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you
and if you want to your lawyer or your opponent need to go face this group of $unc$twenty-five or a judge like they have on t v
good idea
yeah
and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case
yeah
right
thats
and lets get rid of some of this harassment suing
right
thats a good idea
i
in the $unc$bible it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first
and if that doesnt work then to go get somebody a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them
and if that doesnt work to take it to the whole church
so thats right off that same kind of principle
you bet
and if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldnt have half the
thats a good idea
yeah
thats true
thats true too
but that whole biblical concept like thats true in a lot of our
the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that
it doesnt work on that
but its based out of that
so that could work
yes
id forgotten what thats called
theres a real name for that like the judean law or something like that
what is that called
the judeo-christian ethic
$unc$judeo-christian ethic
that may be right
its in there some place
yeah
i think we both know that were talking about the foundation of our legal society
right
right
right
and too the
that was sort of the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly
uh-huh
i guess the $unc$lord started out with ill treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
thats sort of the $unc$old $unc$testament version
yeah
thats
i know
i did a $unc$sunday school lesson $unc$one time on the difference between the $unc$old $unc$testament and the $unc$new $unc$testament where theres a vengeful $unc$lord in the $unc$old $unc$testament and theres a loving $unc$lord in the $unc$new $unc$testament
really
but thats a whole different subject
really
really
yeah
okay
i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on the legal system
mine too
yeah
mine too
but its been a pleasure talking with you
yeah
same here
what part of the country are you from
im living here in $unc$texas
okay
in $unc$texas
okay
i was just being curious
okay
thats quite all right
yeah
im from the $unc$dallas area
so am i
okay
thats neat
in fact im at work out at $unc$lewisville
are you really
wow
okay
ill let you go
and it was nice talking to you
my pleasure
have a good day
you too
bye-bye
bye
i dont think that its wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions
for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where theres endangerment to their own life and other peoples lives
i agree with that
people that are driving like truck drivers and things like that
uh-huh
i definitely think they should be tested
and im not opposed to any testing
because i know i certainly wouldnt want to be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or because he was on drugs while he was there
yeah
how do you feel about companies drug testing prior to hiring
i was tested within my company
i think its kind of a push to weed out drugs in states
because i dont know of any other countries that are doing this
uh-huh
and i feel like its really just within the $unc$united $unc$states
its okay
i think your record should stand for itself that if youve been tested at other companies and youve always come up negative or whatever then i dont see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
uh-huh
and once youve established the fact that youre not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that youre not i think they could save money by not doing that every time
if you change jobs you wouldnt have to do it if youd just been tested at your other work place
what about random testing though
oh
do you feel like thats an invasion of certain peoples rights if not everyone is tested
not if its done fairly
and thats probably my question is how do you know its done fairly
i dont know that you do
if its random then its random
yeah
and thats not necessarily fair
they might tell you its random
uh-huh
but then its kind of like a lottery
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesnt win anything and tries and tries and tries
yeah
i know that for instance in the $unc$n $unc$c double $unc$a they drug test
and its not random
i see
how do they pick their people
i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
uh-huh
and from that point on the $unc$n $unc$c double $unc$a does have something to do with it
but its almost discretionary on the coachs part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
i see
do you
and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
right
do you think that should be implemented in the work place as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs
do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested
not being a drug user i dont have a problem with that personally
right
but i think that might be a violation of someones rights
if someones having personal problems for some reason thats causing them to behave differently
right
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem
if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
right
right
yeah
it would almost be like a
its an accusation
and its based on a perception as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave normal
uh-huh
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and your supervisor has accused you of using drugs
right
exactly
i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if its across the board from the janitors to the executive management
right
i agree with that
because i know personally myself ive been in the same job for $unc$three years
it will be $unc$three years in $unc$august
and ive already been drug tested $unc$three times
what type of job do you have
im an environmental engineer
uh-huh
and ive been drug tested $unc$three times
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
and the company i work for is $unc$sixty $unc$thousand people plus
so for some reason ive come up $unc$three times
thats pretty high statistics
does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
no
no
not at all
that doesnt
i
its a legal job
uh-huh
so its really strange
that is odd
i was drug tested not for the job i have now but for the prior job
but i know that the job i had before that
the job i have now requested my medical record from my old company
uh-huh
so i dont know if i wasnt drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didnt request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion
right
for instance does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey weve already drug tested her
and she came up negative
no
i dont think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i didnt
yeah
they dont know that i dont use drugs
they just tested me once
right
right
but i used to work for a power company
so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen were clean
uh-huh
uh-huh
and since i was just $unc$one of the office folk i guess it wasnt as important to them that they test me regularly
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board
uh-huh
yeah
and are they tested random
no
theyre
all of them are tested once every $unc$three mo-
theyre
its a rotation
okay
i see
but it
but again it depends on what job youre in
yeah
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
and the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines arent tested as much
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is
i see
they say were testing you tomorrow
and well test you every $unc$three months thereafter while you work here
uh-huh
okay
so they know that
and thats
yeah
its made very clear upon hiring
uh-huh
okay
have we spent our at least $unc$five minutes
yeah
okay
i think so
yeah
$unc$seven $unc$twenty-five
okay
okay
nice speaking to you
nice talking to you
bye-bye
bye
okay
what kind of car are you thinking about getting
none at the moment
when you decide to
no
no
no
i currently drive a $unc$ford $unc$taurus
uh-huh
and i would imagine that if i change or if i get a new car i will go with the $unc$taurus or something similar in that regard
so you like the $unc$ford
absolutely
i have had it for about $unc$two years now
uh-huh
and its everything its supposed to be
i havent had a minutes trouble with it
uh-huh
and the only thing i have against it in thats its a $unc$taurus
but even after $unc$two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a $unc$honda before that
uh-huh
and so its a little bit larger
right
but thats the only difference that i see really
but i would
my criteria at the moment it would be american personally
an-
uh-huh
yeah
its the
this
the car i had before this one was a $unc$thunderbird as a matter of fact
uh-huh
and i loved it
i really did
but i finally decided to go check out what the foreign cars were
so i bought myself a $unc$nissan a $unc$two $unc$forty $unc$s $unc$x
uh-huh
but even though i love the car ive got now i think my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it id like to stay american
uh-huh
i always have up until now
i just for $unc$one time decided to go outside
so
my wife still has a $unc$honda $unc$accord
uh-huh
and its an excellent automobile price and so forth
uh-huh
im not a real car fan
i do not opt for something that would be expensive
right
i want something thats serviceable something that i can use
uh-huh
and i
and with the $unc$taurus
i have a $unc$taurus $unc$l $unc$x
and its
youre talking when you think about price its several $unc$thousand dollars lower than the comparable $unc$honda or $unc$nissan or something along those lines
uh-huh
and as i said as far im concerned it has been extremely serviceable and everything i wanted
fords done a real good job in the last $unc$ten years or at least the last $unc$five to $unc$six years of really turning around their quality i think
uh-huh
i think so too
i
in travel and renting automobiles in
uh-huh
ive driven $unc$chevrolet automobiles and $unc$dodge
and i
if its $unc$chevrolet i just will not touch it
i had a $unc$chevrolet before i bought my $unc$taurus
i purchased a $unc$chevy $unc$citation
yeah
those were not good cars
and i was ready to get rid of it $unc$two months after i bought it
uh-huh
so i shopped around
and if i had thought i wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with an $unc$accord or even a $unc$civic or something comparable from $unc$nissan or $unc$toyota
uh-huh
right
but it was just
i have a friend who has an auto shop
and he purchased $unc$one of the first $unc$sables that was manufactured for his wife a $unc$sable station wagon
and he just absolutely swore by it
uh-huh
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for comparably equipped with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio and all these other things
uh-huh
it was just
there was no comparison
the only thing that i find if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft $unc$american ride
right
not
thats about the only thing i find disadvantageous to it
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something thats serviceable
and i drive around a lot
and its very comfortable on the highway
i can drive for $unc$ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way
uh-huh
but those are my criteria
and i probably in another $unc$six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again
and if theres something out there that is comparable to what i have now ill go ahead and get it
uh-huh
the only thing im looking at right now
i just bought the $unc$nissan that ive got about $unc$nine months ago
i guess it was
the only thing that would get me to change cars right now would be if
at the moment im single
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it
but i dont have any plans for probably another $unc$two $unc$three years of even looking
uh-huh
cars are too expensive right now to even think about buying new cars every couple of years
i
yeah
its
in our parking lots $unc$two or $unc$three days ago i saw $unc$one of the new $unc$honda sports cars
uh-huh
i cant remember what the name is
its the $unc$thirty-five or $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollar one whatever it is
and it resembled a $unc$mazaratti very very closely
and its an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth
uh-huh
but to pay that much money for an automobile is just
i cant conceive of doing that
yeah
thats
i went to a car show down here about $unc$two weeks ago
and of course they had the $unc$ford the $unc$chevrolet that stuff
but then you started looking at the
they had $unc$ferrari there they had $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w and all these other kinds of cars
and $unc$ferrari didnt even let you near the car
they were
thats how expensive they were
uh-huh
and then you saw $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollar cars
you saw $unc$eighty $unc$thousand dollar cars
and even though i do enjoy cars i enjoy driving them i enjoy riding in them and everything but i cant see paying more for a car than i would for a house
thats true
that doesnt seem likely
the difference there between us is that i am not really crazy about driving
uh-huh
i never have been since my parents had to force me to get my drivers license when i was young when i was $unc$sixteen
uh-huh
so ive never really cared
what i was
before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little sports car racing
it was never my own car
uh-huh
it was always someone elses
and that sort of thing i enjoy
but to go out and drive never has really had any appeal to me in that regard
uh-huh
i guess weve discussed that enough
dont you think
i think so
we wont get the recorder or the system to shut us off tonight
thats happened to me almost every time ive
thats happened to me once
its very easy when you get on a topic that you enjoy
yeah
i think the $unc$one time i did it was on the $unc$mid $unc$east the crisis out there
yeah
that had a great conversation
but then they came off and told us we couldnt do it any more
so
i was talking to a lady last evening
and we were talking about fishing
and we were cut off
we were told to quit
yeah
okay
you have a pleasant evening
you too
take care
bye-bye
good-bye
okay
what do you think about it
i guess im more concerned about public safety than i am about the concern for the idea of preserving privacy for the individual
privacy
right
because i cant really see why anyone who has nothing to hide would object
there is always the possibility even remote as it is of
of course that is certainly true
yeah
yeah
and that bothers me
im very much for drug testing
uh-huh
i really am
im going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it
sure
i have to take medication for kidney transplant
uh-huh
and im going to be taking that the rest of my life
you
sure
i dont know how thats going to affect
if you had to have a drug test
right
yeah
i havent had $unc$one yet
$unc$t $unc$i
i work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we do have the random drug testing
but ive missed it so far
but in the back of my mind it always bothers me
and what happens if they catch it
they think that im on drugs
and they send me and have me go through this thing
checked out or whatever
yeah
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that
i agree that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test
uh-huh
but i would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that
for example that $unc$one positive would not be accepted as an automatic reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever but that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps $unc$one or $unc$two more stages where further tests could be done
right
uh-huh
because there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with false positives for certain kind of drugs
on the other hand i think theres certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in the transportation industry specifically
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
but in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs its not even going to effect anybody but himself and his own family perhaps depending on the kind of drug he might be on
right
but and eventually thats going to show up anyway in the way he works and so on
uh-huh
but theres so many things that it would make a difference
i guess i would not want to have anyone in my family victimized by a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who hadnt been tested
right
i said im very much pro testing
and this is why
yeah
number $unc$one is im kind of
i know this sounds like a slogan for the government
but we are in a war against drugs
yeah
its horrible
sure
you dont know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it takes some drastic steps at this point
and i think personally the drastic step has to be that you cant work if you continue taking drugs
yeah
its as simple as that
ma- not necessarily difficult
make it difficult enough
but make it so that its not glamorous
yeah
yeah
its glamorous taking drugs
or at least it seems that way
yeah
according to what you hear
yeah
the people who have serious problems
we have
i guess were kind of lucky
we really only know of $unc$one young man whos a fam-
they go to our church
uh-huh
and its the son and so on
and he was friends with my children
and hes really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up having been involved with drugs
but i know of a number of other people who have gotten all messed up
uh-huh
most of these are young people
i work in the education system
and so i have a little more contact with that
but the effect that its had on this young mans life is so dramatic that its heartbreaking
uh-huh
and he may never really be a productive member of society
but sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable
he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that hes not sure if hes going try to commit suicide or not
huh
hes so messed up
right
and this was a nice sweet young man who teenager
and hes now a young man about $unc$twenty i guess who just got really down the wrong path
right
and i dont know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people in the work force as well
uh-huh
its horrible
then
lets answer the second half of the question
what limits ought to be put on it do you think
the limits would i think have to do with what id alluded to before that $unc$one positive on a drug test would not constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might have set up for those who genuinely have a problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
in other words there needs to be more than
treatment before dismissal type thing
pard-
yes
right
yeah
there needs to be more than $unc$one test
and there needs to be some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens
uh-huh
there are lots of things that are involved there such as perhaps denial of insurance for someone
uh-huh
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this that
it would be unfair
and people who are on medication for example or even people who might be of the gay community
and im not an advocate for that particular segment of society
but i think that there doesnt need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination
right
because it makes a bigger problem
so it seems to me that there needs to be some rules that protect
uh-huh
im not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say certain segments should not have to be tested
i really dont see why
personally i think thats what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
and yeah
yeah
i dont know why it would be bad to test just every-
it
and it may be
its not feasible to do everyone
but certainly random testing the fact that people know that they
that it could happen
yeah
uh-huh
would be some measure of protection
but the bottom line is that if youre going to stay clean and straight then youre going to do that because you want to
right
really
theres going to be some measure of incentive reward or whatever
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
yeah
so ive got to agree with that
thats very true
it sounds like we agree anyway
yeah
i think so
i think we did pretty good
yeah
all right
i guess thats about it
i guess if thats all weve done
and i guess weve talked long enough
all right
it was nice talking to you
it was nice talking to you too
okay
bye-bye
all right
bye-bye
do you own a p c
no
i dont
i have $unc$one at
the company i work for furnishes
so i can work at home
wow
and its just an old compact that is super slow
but it does its job
so
what processor does it have in it
i dont know
its so old
its $unc$one of
what kind of work do you do on it
i do television ratings
and i process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations their clients
okay
so
yeah
its basically just data entry and running some software
so it doesnt really have to be anything sophisticated
yeah
i dont own a p c
but i work for $unc$t $unc$i
and
yeah
my husband does too
so
i have a fairly fancy one
its a $unc$t $unc$i model
its an $unc$s $unc$p $unc$one $unc$thousand which has a fast processor in it a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six
uh-huh
and i
the job that i do
i do a lot of training of our customers for new products
uh-huh
and i have to develop functional specs and desk top publishing and everything
so its kind of fun
uh-huh
yeah
i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house
but i just havent got around to doing it yet
yeah
id like to have $unc$one for the house too
but sometimes my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work
i dont want to come home and have to work on $unc$one too
your husband what group is your husband in
something with the defense
oh
defense systems and electronics group
yeah
something like that
yeah
theyve changed their name so many times ive lost track
so
i see
yeah
he works up in $unc$plano
okay
yeah
i work on printers and the peripheral products division basically
uh-huh
i work in the airline marketing group
oh
so we do a lot of
i didnt even know they had anything like that
yeah
man
theres so
theyre
i learned so many things that they do
theyre into so many different things
so
yeah
i just kind of
in for a while
he had $unc$one of those what are they top secret things where he couldnt talk about what he did for a while
uh-huh
yeah
but then he switched jobs
i dont understand half the stuff he does
and i have
is he a programmer
uh-huh
i see
software design engineer as they call it
so
but i have a degree in information management which is computer
uh-huh
right
its basically the business end of it than the programming end of it
right
but ive been at it for $unc$five years
so everythings changed so much i probably couldnt even get a job right now
it seems like its changed so much
so theyve made such advances in computers
so
really
so does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook
does he bring a little one home with him
or
no
huh-uh
sometimes he brought home a portable one
uh-huh
but it quit working
so brought it back
and he just hasnt brought another one home
but they did give him a new computer at work
so
i see
yeah
we build laptop and notebook computers here in $unc$temple also
uh-huh
and those are really handy
they have modems in them you can send a fax from your p c
how nice
but theyre really
no
he doesnt have $unc$one of those
so
whats that
he doesnt have $unc$one of those
yeah
theyre pretty handy because when i travel its easy to check messages
just plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
uh-huh
and
yeah
my husband doesnt have to travel
so
okay
yeah
i just found out im going to $unc$denver $unc$sunday night again
boy
at least you get to
so that kind of reeks havoc with plans
but its really not enough to become a big hassle
uh-huh
thats good
some people enjoy the travel
but i dont think id like it if he traveled a lot
i see
yeah
i would love to have a computer
they
but theyre so expensive
i dont know
there you can get
depends on what you consider expensive
uh-huh
you can get real high powered stuff now for under $unc$two $unc$thousand dollars where just a few years ago it would have been $unc$six $unc$seven $unc$eight $unc$nine $unc$thousand dollars
yeah
i guess its inexpensive compared to what it used to be
but its a lot to put into $unc$one
yeah
its still
$unc$two $unc$thousand dollars isnt just pocket change to a lot of people
thats right
no
its not
its not pocket change
so its major
maybe when the kids get in school that will be
when they start needing something then that will be different
but
yeah
when i started at $unc$t $unc$i i was a summer development student and finishing up at school
uh-huh
and so those papers really
it was nice having access to the equipment to
yeah
yes
i remember that
i had to do some of my husbands papers because i had access to $unc$one
but his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing
so
yeah
i did a lot of his papers
yeah
they come in real handy
that was a lifesaver
how many different types of packages do you use
at home
uh-huh
all i
the packages i dont really use
what i use that outside development that we use most of its just stuff thats been written in house that i use
okay
yeah
golly
ive got
up at work anyway i use $unc$wordperfect and $unc$lotus which is a line-draw package
yeah
i know those $unc$two
uh-huh
ive just used $unc$wordperfect and $unc$lotus the most
yeah
you probably use or something like that for your data entry stuff that your talking about
yeah
yeah
a lot of the data entry stuff they used survey system and just in-house programs to do what they needed
i work
do you work at home all the time
or just
no
i worked for this company before i had my first daughter
uh-huh
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things
so
that worked out pretty good then
yeah
it did
i dont do a lot of what i used to do
i just do something really minor
but its something that nobody else wants to do
uh-huh
yeah
and its time consuming
so
so it keeps you in the company
thats right
it gives me a paycheck
goes for $unc$three to $unc$four weeks $unc$three times a year
uh-huh
its not something thats continual because the television ratings dont come out all the time
they only come out $unc$four times a year
but
yeah
boy
i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here id get all kinds of stuff done
oh
phones always ringing
and people always asking me to do something else
uh-huh
yeah
ive got a lot of
especially right now weve got several new products coming out
and ive got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise
uh-huh
will they let you take a computer home to work
yeah
but i need to be at the office too
uh-huh
ive just got to deal with all those other things that happen
but a p c at the house would really take a lot of the load off
yeah
yeah
i bet
yeah
my hu- he took $unc$one home when they had a big deadline coming up
and it was looking a little touchy to meet
so
uh-huh
ive done that before a couple times
yeah
but that would make it just that much easier
instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks
uh-huh
thats right
i thought that would be
because its real nice with this because i dont even have to go into the office
ive maybe been into the office once in the past $unc$three years
my
they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever
so
man that sounds really nice
yeah
it is real nice
i just deal with them on the telephone
half the people dont even know who theyre talking to
uh-huh
but i worked
i know most of them
i cant say that
a lot of people changed around there
but most people know who i am
but i dont know who they are
uh-huh
a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice
right
yeah
ive got a lot of folks that ive worked with like that as well
yeah
you just know them by the telephone
but its been good talking to you
i think weve got the subject
yeah
we sort of stayed to the topic anyway
yeah
we tried
its hard to sometimes
okay
well talk to you later
okay thanks
bye bye
bye
perhaps this connection
no
it still echoes
okay
do you like to cook
i love it
i do too
its kind of hard to find time sometimes
but
do you work
yes
and have a family
i dont have a family
but i usually work about $unc$fifty hours a week
and by the time i get home im so tired its hard to cook a full meal
oh!
i expect so
for a dinner party i think $unc$one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine
thats really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce
oh
so where did you get your recipe for it
i guess mostly out of an international cookbook that i have
okay
mine actually came from the $unc$texas $unc$instruments $unc$cafeteria
oh
they
they have a $unc$t $unc$i plant in $unc$texas in $unc$kingsport
yeah
we have
its in $unc$johnson $unc$city
uh-huh
and the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes once a month
theyll put out a recipe of the month
uh-huh
great
and they put this $unc$one out
and i tried it
and it was really good
what is a marsala wine a sweeter wine
yeah
a little bit sweeter
uh-huh
and its a red wine
okay
and im trying to think what else
i roll it in bread crumbs and $unc$parmesan cheese
uh-huh
and then i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil and pour the wine sauce over it like the last $unc$twenty minutes so that it gets just enough flavor
huh
oh
so it kind of browns
and then you put wine over it
right
uh-huh
that sounds real good
and its really easy too
so
yeah
what do you use
what do you serve with it
huh
what do you serve with it
i like to serve a wild rice with it
uh-huh
thats what i do too
this is really neat
and i
were big broccoli fans
uh-huh
thats what ive got
ive got steamed broccoli down on mine
i just dont think you can go wrong with something like that
no
its great
ive got a good dessert recipe
what
do you like angel food cake
yes
i just break it up in a glass bowl
uh-huh
and then i mix up some cream cheese and a little bit of $unc$amaretta and some $unc$cool $unc$whip
wow
and i make a thickened blueberry sauce
and i layer it with angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping
what time should we be there
that sounds wonderful
its great
i love desserts
but since theres only $unc$two of us its really
uh-huh
i try to avoid making anything too fancy that wed like too much and eat too much
right
i know what you mean
we dont eat desserts much any more
but i guess $unc$one that i really like that i havent made in awhile
and its called a fruit pizza
uh-huh
and you take a sugar cookie recipe and spread it out on a pizza pan
uh-huh
so you make it like a pizza crust
and then you bake that
and then you take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want
uh-huh
and you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice
and i cant remember what else is in it
and you make kind of a glaze
uh-huh
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that
and pour that over it
yeah
that sounds great
it is really good
and its real light
it would be pretty
and it
depending on the fruit you use its real colorful
right
yeah
especially with the kiwi and the strawberries
right
that would be pretty
but usually i just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream
weve been fixing something lately that
weve been cooking a lot of turkey breasts because its low fat
uh-huh
yeah
its just so much better for you
and ive been making a hot sandwich
i toast a piece of whole wheat bread and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat swiss cheese
uh-huh
and then i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it and pop it in the microwave
oh!
that sounds great
it is delicious
i wouldnt mind serving that to anybody
no
and thats something that just doesnt take a long time to fix
no
its really good
and its really good for you
yeah
its real quick
and we eat out a lot
and there are sometimes you just dont feel like eating out
right
and i wish i had something a little bit different to just zap together
uh-huh
yeah
ma-
mix up a little mayonnaise with some $unc$dijon mustard and honey until it just
uh-huh
i mix it until it just tastes good to me
i was going to say do you just mix it to taste
uh-huh
okay
yeah
and its real good
and it keeps in the refrigerator
how long does it keep
do you
you wouldnt have to make
it keeps a long time
yeah
and you wouldnt have to mix that much together even
no
uh-huh
it keeps a long time
im sorry i keep coughing
ive had a bad cold
oh
and i put a little yogurt in it too
plain
plain yogurt
if i
just plain yogurt
it gives it a little tang
ill bet that is really good
it makes a great sandwich
man
im going to have to think of that
were getting company tonight
are you
and i have been debating what to cook because $unc$one of my guests is a vegetarian
yeah
thats kind of hard
so were going to
i think well try to do something a little bit
we might try to grill some flounder or salmon steaks
theyll eat fish
yeah
shell eat fish
and i usually
when they come down ill grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce
uh-huh
and definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat
right
uh-huh
that sounds good
right
i had a recipe from that international cookbook $unc$two thats a great salad in summertime
do you garden or not
no
we dont
our next door neighbors do
and a lot of times theyll give us something
okay
its just sliced tomatoes
and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips just over it and some red onion slices and just a little bit of basil and then a little italian dressing over it
yeah
oh!
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
and everybody loves it
and its so easy
and its delicious
thats what i was just thinking
it doesnt sound like it would be hard at all
huh-uh
it isnt
where did you get
and you can put some cucumber slices on too
where did you get this cook book
i got it at the $unc$checkbook $unc$store
really!
and its got all these beautiful pictures in there that are inspiring
its going to say edited by $unc$charlotte $unc$turgeon editor of
im not $unc$french $unc$laroute $unc$gastro $unc$lamink
the creative cooking course
ill might have to visit the $unc$state $unc$book $unc$store
im trying to see who its published by $unc$ottenheimer
ive never heard of it
i havent either
this edition is published by $unc$bonanza $unc$books
okay
its a big book
but it was not expensive
the ones that ive been wanting to get
i guess youve seen the $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$sixty-five ways to cook chicken and the $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$sixty-five ways to cook pasta
uh-huh
uh-huh
ive been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken
and we do eat a lot of pasta
yeah
we just said the other night it wouldnt be too difficult to do without red meat
thats right
i dont think it would
we dont have that much of it now
as long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken
uh-huh
i stir fried some the other night though
some beef and broccoli strips
it was good
but it didnt have much beef in it
yeah
ive got a $unc$wok that we dont use near as often as we used to
uh-huh
we used to stir fry a lot especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes
uh-huh
it just takes the time to cut everything up
yeah
but usually if i take a day off or on the weekend especially i try to cook real food
cook
uh-huh
and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead
right
so that we can have those to enjoy
uh-huh
$unc$one of my daughters sent me a $unc$colorado cook book put out by the $unc$junior $unc$league of $unc$denver
uh-huh
have you ever seen any put out by $unc$junior $unc$leagues
yes
cause we have some local ones
they are great
uh-huh
and we have a share alike column in the paper where people write in and share recipes or write in and say im looking for this recipe
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and thats where i get a lot of my recipes
yeah
they are usually good arent they
yes
and i got a real good one from a doctors office $unc$one time
is that right
what was that
its a baked bean recipe
uh-huh
and you mix baked beans and $unc$lima beans
and lets see i guess
you buy the canned baked beans
yeah
just mix the canned beans together and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you just bake it
and its like a spicier baked bean dish
that sounds
and you can add hamburger if you want to give it a little more body
uh-huh
that sounds good
so i try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you wouldnt even think about it
right
so i try to always keep a little notebook in my purse
uh-huh
jot them down
but its been
i guess were on
hang on
let me try it again because usually
do you usually get a message
yeah
hang on let me check on it
i dont know
let me try it once more
i think were on maybe
okay
i guess well find out
yeah
in $unc$maryland are you a $unc$skins fan
not really from
i really wasnt from here
so the teams i really root for in football are the $unc$niners and the $unc$seahawks because i used to live out in $unc$california i like $unc$seattle because i like $unc$seattle
yeah
and besides i like the city
okay
so you were out there in $unc$san $unc$francisco
yeah
$unc$san $unc$jose but close
yeah
yeah
yeah
other than the big catch with the $unc$forty-niners and the $unc$cowboys back a few year ago i like $unc$san $unc$francisco
okay
but i dont know
i never really was a $unc$cowboys fan until i moved down to $unc$texas
is that where you are now
yeah
okay
im in $unc$dallas
and i guess when youre down here in $unc$dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the $unc$cowboys because this is a big football territory down here
uh-huh
yeah
and unfortunately of course the $unc$cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years
uh-huh
that
i dont know
everybodys kind of
theyre still behind them
but its not like it used to be
yeah
you back the winners
and you dont back them when theyre not doing well
thats right
but i think in trying to follow the $unc$cowboys over the years i think they used to have a philosophy for i dont know probably the last $unc$twenty-five years except for about the last about $unc$five or $unc$six years they always went out and tried to draft the best athletes and didnt really draft for any particular spot
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche
uh-huh
and then about $unc$four or $unc$five years ago they started going after specific players or positions
the press would get down on $unc$landry
and this is when $unc$schramm was still there
uh-huh
and theyd go after them saying jeez what you really need is a defensive end
so theyd go out and try to find a defensive end
and when they drafted somebody and he didnt work out at that spot it really wasnt a good enough athlete to move to any place else
uh-huh
so i think it was kind ever interesting
i think the decline of the $unc$cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting the best athletes
yeah
it makes sense because youve got the flexibility if theyre good athlete they can do a bunch of different things
yeah
yeah
but
and i dont
my main sport is baseball
but ive been enjoying football
but i dont know it as well
yeah
i just
$unc$cowboys are going to have a problem arent they
is it this year they dont have a draft pick because of the $unc$walker trade
or what was the whole deal on that
they still have some draft picks that they got
they dont have anything high do they
no
they picked up some from $unc$minnesota
i think it was minnesotas
thats right
thats right
they
it went the other way
yeah
what was i thinking
they traded $unc$herschel to $unc$minnesota
they traded $unc$walker
yeah
yeah
okay
my brain is really working well tonight
thats okay
they
ive got a friend that lives right next to the cowboys training camp
uh-huh
and he sees them out running a lot
and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
and theyre all thinking that they really got something going this year
uh-huh
but i guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybodys got great hopes
know i guess its the same way with baseball or anybody
uh-huh
$unc$spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good
yeah
if you go to
im sure if you go to any of the $unc$twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say were going to be $unc$super $unc$bowl champs
because i know in baseball any manager you go to say were going to be in the $unc$world $unc$series even though theres not a prayer
yeah
really
yeah
yeah
really
this is the way it is
$unc$kim didnt the $unc$cowboys even finish
they finished pretty close to $unc$five $unc$hundred last year didnt they
yeah
they did as a matter of fact
because they only won $unc$one game the year before right
yeah
okay
yeah
i enjoyed that because it was against the $unc$skins
you dont like the $unc$skins
no
i live near $unc$baltimore
and i really dont like $unc$d $unc$c a whole lot at all
okay
and im really
they got a big thing because of the expansion going on in baseball
$unc$d $unc$c is talking about how theyre going to get a baseball team and everything
its like you guys arent going to get a baseball team im sorry its not going to happen
jeez
but of course the griping is that if $unc$washington doesnt get a baseball team then $unc$baltimore shouldnt get a football team which is probably true
but anyway ive never liked $unc$d $unc$c a whole lot
and a really hate the $unc$redskins and a lot of its because i got a lot of people at work with and everything that are big $unc$redskin fans
of course
yeah
yeah
yeah
of course then youre not that far from $unc$philadelphia
yeah
ive never liked $unc$philadelphia the city a whole lot
the only reason i really enjoy the $unc$eagles at all is because i really like $unc$randall $unc$cunningham
okay
i
it was $unc$buddy $unc$ryan the $unc$one that i cant stand too much
ye-
considering how well he gets along with $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson that doesnt surprise me
yeah
really
yeah
there was this ther- in
the $unc$baltimore $unc$sun has this cartoonist in the sports section
and when
last
i guess it was $unc$january when $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
uh-huh
it was the same year that $unc$buddy $unc$ryan got fired
and he had this cartoon in there about $unc$jimmy johnsons big day
the first thing is the phone call from the league saying he was coach of the year
and the second was this phone call from $unc$buddy $unc$ryan i got fired can you believe that
jeez
yeah
you said you lived near $unc$baltimore
yeah
youre out
i used to travel out that way a lot
and i used to drive a lot between $unc$baltimore and $unc$washington
and
no
i lived
do you know what $unc$ellicott $unc$city is
no
okay
but basical- $unc$route $unc$seventy and $unc$route $unc$forty
yeah
i used to go out of $unc$b $unc$w $unc$i a lot
yeah
thats not far from where the new football stadium would be if we got an $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l team
yeah
yeah
theyve built a new stadium downtown
its opening next year
is that near the what do they
i forgot the name of it
is it the $unc$wharf or the $unc$inner $unc$harbor
the $unc$inner $unc$harbor
yeah
its a couple of blocks west
there is an old railroad yard basically
yeah
theres a big long railroad shed
and then theres an old station
and theyre building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the $unc$inner $unc$harbor which is really stupid because $unc$one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the $unc$inner $unc$harbor
and the only way youre going to have a view of is this big brick wall
great
but theyre building the baseball stadium
and theyve got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l team
yeah
so its real easy access from south of $unc$baltimore like the airport or more importantly for the $unc$orioles from $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
the $unc$orioles say they get $unc$twenty-five percent of their attendance from $unc$d $unc$c
i tell you what i
the
theres
the $unc$colts still to me are the $unc$baltimore $unc$colts
uh-huh
yeah
they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis
i never been real thrilled with not
sitting here and talking about all the cities that i hate
i went to $unc$purdue $unc$university for a couple of years and really learned to hate $unc$indianapolis while i was out there
okay
and i was not real happy when they left to go there of all places
jeez
yeah
did you graduate from $unc$purdue
no
i transferred to $unc$delaware and graduated there
$unc$delaware
yeah
theres not a whole lot in $unc$delaware
yeah
but its close to $unc$philadelphia and $unc$baltimore
yeah
so its
thats true coast right
kind of all over the place but east coast lately
okay
do you have any children
no
i dont
you dont
do you
yes
i have $unc$one a $unc$five year old daughter
uh-huh
did you ever have her in child care
yes
i do
she was at a private
i stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born
uh-huh
and then i had her at a private sitter for i guess $unc$two $unc$two and a half years after that
and how did you choose that sitter
she was referred to me by a couple of people
and she turned out to be wonderful
i couldnt have asked for anything better i dont think
yeah
i didnt want to send her straight to a day care
right
and even though she was that old i still didnt want her to go to a day care
yeah
and this lady you would think it was her own
really
yeah
shes real good
its hard to find people like that
yes
it is
and now i have got her in a $unc$montessori school
uh-huh
and shes really really doing good and learning a lot
and ive started working up there in the afternoons too
yeah
thats neat
y-
yeah
i guess im going to quit as soon as the school seasons over
but i really enjoyed being with her up there
i hate it for her
she has to stay that much longer
yeah
but
do they have classes for them during the summer too
yeah
they go year-round teach them
huh
now in the summer they have a lot of field trips
yeah
theres a field trip just about every day if they want to go on $unc$one and stuff like that
its a lot more lax
but they still go through all their curriculum as usual
what kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there
gosh
i ca-
my husband and i both went
we kind of give her the third degree
good
im glad to hear that
yeah
we went over to her house
so we told her pro-
we just told here wed be over that day
we didnt tell her when
so that way i didnt think the house would be cleaned or anything for me specifically
yeah
right
and she had a daughter
and i want to say her daughter was like $unc$six or $unc$seven right around first second grade
and at the time she kept $unc$one other child about a $unc$four year old i believe
but it was only like a part-time basis
so we went over there
and we questioned her about what she fed them and what she did with them during the day and just how she treated them how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that
yeah
and we really seem to be pleased with her
and
did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision
yes
yes
and she still loves her to death
mean when they see each other they just love each other to death
and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter either making her clothes or buying her things
really
yeah
so were real real lucky
but aft-
so she stayed with her about roughly $unc$two years
and she had to go back to work
they had some other expenses that came up
so she had to go i guess get a real job
yeah
get a real job full time
yeah
so
so what made you decide to put her in a $unc$montessori school
i checked a lot of places out the $unc$kinder $unc$cares and the stuff like that
and i live in $unc$garland
and theres this $unc$montessori school thats nearby
and it had been recommended by some friends of ours
but its an older place
and so i checked out all the new places that were near us
and then i checked that place out
and even though it was older it was real comfortable and i guess kind of homey
uh-huh
yeah
and they didnt just play all day long
i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and interviewed at they did a lot of play work and stuff
and then they
almost all of them had a $unc$montessori section
and i thought that must be pretty good if everybodys trying to incorporate a little bit of it into their school
yeah
yeah
and they made sure they pointed it out
but after i looked at this place and i took $unc$randi with me i think just about to every place
$unc$one place i think i didnt take her
uh-huh
and i just kind of let her go see what she felt like doing
yeah
and that place
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them its hard to drag her away
so i felt more comfortable at that place
thats the true test
yeah
yeah
and she was real comfortable
and she has really done good
i
its hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her
yeah
but she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart
and shes already reading and writing and stuff like that
thats good
and she just turned $unc$five last month
that is good then
yeah
i think so
i didnt want to rush school at her the whole time
but
no
especially were going to spend the next $unc$eighteen years in school
exactly
exact-
i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next $unc$five months because i know shes going to have to face that
yeah
really
and my $unc$god here we go
thats right
i just hate that
but so you dont have any children
do you have any nieces or nephews then
yeah
yeah
i have a nephew
hes a little brat
he goes to a really crummy day school
my sisters not real bright
but hes always sick
he has always got some kind of cold or something
and i dont know
i dont think this place is a very good place for him
its just kind of convenient
and shes the kind that goes for convenience over anything else
really
just easy to get them there and stu-
yeah
exactly
thats a shame
yeah
i dont think she checks things out very well which really surprises me
really
thats scary
it is scary
yeah
yeah
i was petrified
i know
i would be too
thats
i dont know
thats just it
and thats why i dont mind paying more
yeah
i dont know
i just feel m-
too many horror stories out there that
yes
and thats $unc$one reason i like working up there a little bit is because i know whats really going on
yeah
thats right
i think thats an ideal situation
because you dont know
because at her school as soon as you drive up its got like a circular type drive
they sit
and they have car callers
and some kid goes out and gets the kid
and its time to go
yeah
at first that always kind of bothered me
not bothered me
but i thought id like to see what shes doing know
yeah
but now that im there its a lot more convenient because theres so many kids that doddle when their parents come
uh-huh
and its hard to get them out
and a lot of parents have places to go and things like that
thats right
and its late at night
so now it doesnt bother me at all
but
is that where the
over there off of like
im not sure what the street is
is it near $unc$country $unc$club
yeah
and all
$unc$sixty-six
that one thats set back in the woods
yeah
yeah
yeah
ive seen the signs
thats it
but ive never actually seen the place itself know
yeah
its set far back off the road
right
right
it w-
and thats something i like too
yeah
because a lot of those places are like the $unc$one over here on $unc$seventy-eight $unc$skaggs
definitely
uh-huh
that little $unc$kinder $unc$care whatever it is
yeah
its right there on
which this is on a highway too
but its set back enough to
right
yeah
theres a difference
i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out
or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could go in and get $unc$one
uh-huh
ye-
yep
thats right
or a car accident
yeah
and that was $unc$one of the places i had checked out
yeah
and it was brand new when i checked it out
and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there
yeah
but i that
i didnt base everything on that
no
because that all wears off
thats right
thats exactly right
you get some kids in there
and its over quick
yep
but ive been real pleased knock on wood
im scared to death her going to public school
really
i dont know
i w-
i do know why because drugs and everything else
i would be too
yeah
yeah
and they talk about how soon they start that
yeah
and that scares me
i know
it is scary
youre just with them
do they teach them in school right now where shes at about drugs
yeah
theyve had police officers come in and talk to them about it
good
but of course they still have no concept of what in the world drugs are know
right
right
but
and what to do when theyre faced with it
right
but i just think of her
next year shes going to be $unc$five $unc$six years old in kindergarten in same school with i guess $unc$ten year olds
isnt that sixth grade
yeah
and thats a big gap
it is
and that i can honestly see the peer pressure there
uh-huh
and that just terrifies me to death and stuff
i can see it too
those kids getting snatched
and im probably a little too over protective
uh-huh
but nowadays you have to be
nothing wrong with that
yes
you do
if
i dont think theres anything wrong with that
i at first thought when i didnt have kids
i was going how can you be so protective know
uh-huh
but its easy now
uh-huh
now you understand
yeah
definitely
thats what im thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own youll understand
thats exactly right
and i do
uh-huh
but anyway
are you married
yes
are yall planning on having kids
or
thats good
yeah
because theyre really neat
its just
do you live in $unc$plano or work in $unc$plano or both
both
both
are you a $unc$t $unc$i
yes
are you at work right now
uh-huh
so am i
in which building
are you $unc$summit or are you $unc$spring $unc$creek
im $unc$spring $unc$creek
this is fun
what building are you in
im building $unc$one
im building $unc$two
at least we found something different
thats
ive never had a call
not like that
neither have i
no
isnt that funny
i usually get some place
i got a woman in $unc$new $unc$jersey the last time i called i think
right
thats funny
that is funny
so
so hows the weather in building $unc$two
the weather in building $unc$two is cold
its been cold
its been cold in the building
outside the building its not bad
typical $unc$t $unc$i
listen i got me doing it
typical $unc$texas $unc$spring
are you a native to $unc$texas
no
no
im a transplant
from
from $unc$california
so what do you think of the $unc$texas weather
not as nice as $unc$california
how long have you been here
$unc$five years now
okay
ive been here pretty long
so
you know about $unc$august then
yes
ive been through $unc$five of those
okay
theres no surprises left
right
right
a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in $unc$august for
if theyre going to go out of state for vacation thats the time to go
uh-huh
good idea
real good idea
yeah
we went up to $unc$wyoming this last $unc$summer during that time
and it was like $unc$eighty degrees up there
it was beautiful
nice to get out of $unc$texas for a while
we went to $unc$alaska
thats even farther away
that is really nice
it is so cool you wear a jacket
even in the summer time
yeah
or keep $unc$one handy because it rains a lot in $unc$alaska
uh-huh
uh-huh
is that right
it
they call it their liquid gold
but it
you get sunshine
and its lovely
and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming
green
my goodness its pretty
right
$unc$texas isnt bad
no
no
not in the $unc$spring
right
i have to think every year to try to remember whats it supposed to like this time of year
$unc$spring is nice
yeah
because $unc$march we usually get a lot of rain in $unc$march
itll seem the news the $unc$harold $unc$taft on the local news
right
$unc$march we typically get a lot of rain
and weve had this many inches
and were right on target
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in $unc$march
but i
we always do though
its hard to remember $unc$twelve months ago what it was like
yeah
it
i just wish it wouldnt come all at once
thats right
and then we get all that heat
right
its just that
when it rains it rains
in $unc$california you get these nice lovely rains nothing really like downpours like you have here
the other day we had some hail the biggest hail ive ever seen in $unc$texas
really
yeah
i live in $unc$garland
you got into that bad stuff
yeah
we got hail the size of marbles
just so noisy hitting the house
and the glass on the windows
it didnt break anything
but we went out there afterwards
and theres ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn
isnt that strange
i know i
you pick them up
and theyre perfectly round
and i go how did they form so perfect like that
i think thats $unc$one of the strange things
and you very seldom see it though
right
right
ive seen hail
but usually the size of tiny pebbles
really small
but this was really large
so its a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently
is that correct
i dont know how hail is formed to tell you the truth
i think thats
you dont think its cold enough to
its not on the ground
but in the clouds it is
right
must be
i guess
and then i think all that falling would warm it up and melt it
but maybe thats what rounds it i dont know but tumbling
i was dumb
i was in $unc$florida for a week on business
uh-huh
and i had called back to the house
i stayed the weekend
and i called back to the house
my housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now weve made the national news dont get upset and dont worry
its in $unc$garland where all the bad weather is
i said okay
uh-huh
and i watched the news
and i thought ha ha thats $unc$garland thats not $unc$plano
i dont have anything to worry about
i was on the plane heading back to $unc$dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in $unc$garland
felt so dumb
finally i got home and found out my property was okay
yeah
there was no problem with it
but i guess you just tend to think of where your house is and nothing else
right
right
and close to that whats called $unc$duck $unc$creek that runs through part of $unc$garland thats the part that always seems to get hardest hit when theres the hard rain
i see
the creek overflows
and a lot of houses around that creek seem to get flooded
okay
the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding
that house that i bought is close to a $unc$firewheel golf course
okay
just going to be blocks off of that new highway $unc$one $unc$ninety thats going through
right
thats where i live close to that
really
yeah
not quite
i dont live in that $unc$firewheel division
but i live close by there in far north $unc$garland
is that a nice area
yeah
theyre supposed to
its getting built up with more new shopping centers and things
its a fairly new area
yeah
and theyre supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by $unc$ninety-three or $unc$ninety-four or something
a brand new mall not too far away from that area
so
the house that i bought was really really nice
itd be nice
uh-huh
in the $unc$firewheel $unc$estates there whatever
yes
yes
uh-huh
really really nice home very pretty
uh-huh
but youre not living there right now
no
im going to lease it
i see
its investment property
i see
but its a very nice place
i would cheerfully live there
of course its not my home
and ive lived in my home almost $unc$ten years
and ive got everything just exactly like i want it
right
but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards
its a nice house
uh-huh
yeah
thats a nice area
is it on the golf course
no
its not
its off the golf course
and ill be honest with you
im going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is
is that right
but its in the estates that adjoin it
yeah
right
right
thats a nice area
yes
it is
that really is a nice area
when they get that highway finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick
yeah
that $unc$one $unc$ninety is just going to be outermost loop around
right
another belt line just farther out
right
just continue to do that
right
right
right
where are you from in $unc$california
$unc$southern $unc$california
$unc$san $unc$diego
ive lived in $unc$san $unc$diego for $unc$six years when i was younger and $unc$l $unc$a area
and my parents live in $unc$anaheim right now
lived up north of $unc$los $unc$angeles in $unc$thousand $unc$oaks area where the $unc$cowboys have their training camp or used to anyway
ive been through all of that
yeah
there is an area beyond $unc$thousand $unc$oaks north of $unc$los $unc$angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders
i won-
theyre not really hills
theyre more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation
huh
im not familiar with what
is it along the coast or inland
it may be a little bit more inland
that is $unc$one of the strangest areas i have ever seen
i had to go up to $unc$t $unc$i on business a couple years ago
out there
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we went up that coastline
and i was just amazed how unusual that looks
here hang on just a second
ive got a $unc$los $unc$angeles map
let me just quick
yeah
valley
yes
okay
i know where that is
beyond $unc$thousand $unc$oaks
i know where $unc$valley is
ive been out there before
sure
you dont think thats strange looking
i didnt notice anything strange i guess about it
okay
maybe im used to $unc$texas
maybe $unc$texas the way
the elevation is extremely high
uh-huh
its got curving roads on it
but the
its just a strange landscape
theres very little vegetation
huh
i dont remember seeing that part of it
i know $unc$valley
yeah
its just a suburb of $unc$l $unc$a
right
its a
and theyve built some new highways out to that area and things lately
people can get in and out of $unc$l $unc$a easier
maybe its a place i went to
it was far extreme thought wed never find the place
it was interesting because we went out the $unc$ventura highway to $unc$thousand $unc$oaks and on up through that way
yeah
sounds interesting
right
right
right
i know exactly that area
its a nice area out there
i love $unc$thousand $unc$oaks
$unc$texas i dont know
things
you just have less a variety i guess
i dont think its quite as green
its green with all the trees and things out here
but its just
its green sometime
yeah
but its just
i dont know
it doesnt stay green
right
the really
and in all honesty
i know this sounds like a $unc$texas story
all honesty you havent seen the hottest of summers if youve only been here $unc$five years
we havent had a really bad one
yeah
i missed that $unc$one of $unc$eighty or $unc$eighty-two or $unc$eighty-one that had the heat wave
oh
it may be $unc$eighty-two because we bought our house in $unc$eighty-one
and we built a pool in $unc$eighty-two
okay
okay
im not
i read a lot
but i dont read a whole
i tend to read only out of a couple groups
uh-huh
uh-huh
and im a big baseball fan
so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books
and
im a big baseball fan too
okay
and i read a lot of science fiction
e-
i like
i teach school
and so during the school year i just dont have time to read
and i would love to be able to read more because i enjoy it so much
but with correcting papers and $unc$two kids of my own i just dont have time
but in the summer i try to read a lot
uh-huh
and of course being a woman i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot
i just
i really enjoy that because its kind of a getaway type thing
uh-huh
so i read a lot of that
but i also love sports
and i dont have time to read in
but i do read $unc$sports $unc$illustrated during the year because my son gets that
uh-huh
and but i dont read a lot of nonfiction
and i really should because theres so many self-improvement books out right now that would benefit me greatly
but i just dont
uh-huh
yeah
i dont really i probably should
i dont really read the self-improvement books or things like that
ill get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting
and of course i dont ever get around to reading them
yeah
yeah
i got
i belong to $unc$quality $unc$paperback $unc$book $unc$club
do you
and ill get stuff out of that
i got battle cry of freedom a couple of years ago
uh-huh
and i started reading and got about $unc$sixty pages into it
and its like $unc$eight $unc$hundred pages
my word
and it was like i want to read something else for a while
yeah
its i-
some of those books are real tough to get into
but after you get into them theyre really good
yeah
but its just tough to get through that first $unc$two $unc$hundred pages or so
yeah
especially
battle cry of freedom starts off in the $unc$eighteen forties and its
yeah
wait the war wasnt until the $unc$eightee-
its okay
and i realize these things
these things take awhile to move up
but its hard sometimes
its right
thats right
i find though that when i find an author
and you dont read a lot of fiction you said
but when i find
i read a lot of science fiction
do you
yeah
when i find an author i really like i try to read everything they write because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it
yeah
that and
i do the same thing
i
yeah
theres $unc$one science fiction writer named $unc$allen $unc$dean $unc$foster
uh-huh
ive heard of him
okay
yeah
he
i must have $unc$fifty or $unc$sixty books by him
is that right
i have almost everything hes ever done
uh-huh
and i know that when i get his book im usually going to enjoy it
uh-huh
uh-huh
so its really
its fun to do that
isnt it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction
i think thats unbelievable
yeah
he does a lot of movie adaptations and things like that
does he really
yeah
and his adaptations are usually really good
oh
its funny he
the novelization of star wars was list-
it was out in the stores as being by $unc$george $unc$lucas
but it turns out that $unc$foster actually ghost wrote it for him
is that right
which
when i read it i should have realized that because it had fosters style written all over it
is that right
yeah
uh-huh
ive never read anything of his
but ive heard about him
but wouldnt you think he would
does he get some royalties from that hopefully
im sure he does
i would think he would
id hope so
i mean hes doing all right probably
im sure he is
im sure he is
but sometimes the more you get the more you want too
so
yeah
thats true
yeah
yeah
youre a baseball fan
youre aware of that kind of thing
yeah
right
right
right
in fact im a sports fan period
uh-huh
we
thats why i like to read $unc$sports $unc$illustrated so much
because theres everything in it
yeah
i had a subscription to that last year
but im mostly a baseball fan
so im not as inter-
oh
the other stuff is interesting
but i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff
youre probably a $unc$baltimore fan right an $unc$oriole fan
im a $unc$red $unc$sox fan more than anything
is that right
yeah
$unc$boston
thats good too
but i do like the $unc$orioles also
im sure you do
im a $unc$ranger fan simply because i live here
yeah
but i was
im not from here
im originally from $unc$ohio
so ive always followed the $unc$tigers because i was born and raised in $unc$toledo
$unc$toledo
yeah
i was in $unc$toledo last summer
went to a $unc$mud $unc$hens double header
i love the $unc$mud $unc$hens
theyre great
i love the name
and there was a really big article on the $unc$mud $unc$hens in $unc$sports $unc$illustrated last year
yeah
y-
i saved that issue
did you
thats when i had the subscription
yeah
it was a lot of fun
yeah
i li-
i really enjoy that team
we used to go there all the time
i used to live in $unc$iowa too
and they have the $unc$iowa $unc$oaks
and we used to go to their games all the time
and
they dont exist anymore
i dont think
i know they dont
at least not by that name
theres the $unc$iowa $unc$cubs
but i dont know if they play in the same location
they must have changed then because it used
i havent lived there for l-
ive been here for like $unc$twelve years now
and i havent been back to $unc$des $unc$moines in a long time
but we used to always go to their games
and it was kind of fun
its almost more fun than going to a major league game
i dont know
i just really enjoy the farm teams
i
minor league baseball i think is a lot more fun than major league baseball
yes
it is
its not quite so serious
and its a lot cheaper
thats for sure
thats for sure
yeah
theres a city just west of $unc$baltimore called $unc$frederick
its about $unc$forty miles west
is that right
and they have a minor league team
and i go out there almost as much as the $unc$orioles
and
is that right
i
its just a lot of fun
its free parking
and $unc$four bucks now to get in
and the hot dogs are a dollar
and its just great
how much is an $unc$oriole game
$unc$oriole game
if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium its $unc$four bucks
the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like $unc$six $unc$fifty to $unc$seven $unc$fifty
gosh
its higher than the $unc$rangers
yeah
and hot dogs start at a dollar $unc$fifty
yeah
a-
the food here is outrageous
but you can get a good seat for
it used to be $unc$three dollars
but i think its gone up to $unc$four dollars this year
thats nice
but its in the bleachers way out in center field
but its still nice
yeah
you still can see well
and we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets box seats or something then we usually sit out there
uh-huh
how much are the box seats there
do you know offhand
box seats run from like $unc$eight dollars to $unc$twelve dollars
yeah
thats a little steeper
i think the most expensive seats in $unc$memorial are $unc$eleven bucks
but were getting a new stadium next year
so
so itll go up
yeah
itll go up
and if it opens
its something were really irritated about around here
or some people are really irritated about
they built the new stadium downtown
and theyre saying how theres going to be a lot more parking for the stadium
uh-huh
but i park for free up at $unc$memorial $unc$stadium because i know where i can do it for free
and im not going to be able to do that downtown
thats a bummer
yeah
we
baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the $unc$cowboys
its outrageous to go to the $unc$cowboy game
uh-huh
and the $unc$mavericks are t-
its high too
uh-huh
so baseballs cheap compared to other games
werent you guys supposed to get a stadium in downtown $unc$dallas
that didnt go over now
it didnt go through
$unc$george $unc$bush whos the main owner of the $unc$rangers decided that theyd stay in $unc$arlington
so arlingtons going to build a stadium a bigger one
okay
so theyre going to stay there which is fine because arlingtons got a lot of things to offer
and that was their main money making deal for the city
uh-huh
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away
yeah
because everything
theres $unc$six $unc$flags right by the stadium theres a $unc$wet n $unc$wild
and thats
uh-huh
all the tourists come there
uh-huh
and they
it would have been devastated
they would have collapsed
so im kind of glad theyre staying there because its right in the middle of $unc$fort $unc$worth-dallas
and
yeah
thats what id always heard
ive
yeah
i like it there
and i think $unc$dallas has enough to offer that they dont have to hog everything
so im glad that theyre staying in $unc$arlington
uh-huh
and its takes us maybe $unc$thirty-five to $unc$forty minutes to get there from $unc$plano which is not too bad at all
yeah
thats about what it takes me to get to $unc$memorial
yeah
it actually funny that i live just outside of $unc$baltimore
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to $unc$frederick as it does to go to the ballpark in $unc$baltimore because to go out to $unc$frederick i just jump on the $unc$interstate
is that right
and
because i live just south of the $unc$interstate
uh-huh
hop on the $unc$interstate
and the stadiums right off the $unc$interstate
gosh
so its like i drive west
and im there
and and then to go into $unc$baltimore its fewer miles
but ive got to go stop and go traffic and everything
yeah
yeah
yeah
do you read
i guess you read $unc$sports $unc$illustrated
but you dont read many sports books
or
not really
my son does
i have a son that just turned $unc$sixteen
uh-huh
and he reads everything he get his hands on
hes reading a $unc$dick $unc$vitelle book right now because hes a real big $unc$dick $unc$vitelle fan
hes a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to
and just loves $unc$dick $unc$vitelle which not many people do
but hes reading it
and hes r-
and he says hes so interesting $unc$mom
you just cant believe all the things hes done
and hes really enjoying that
and i
and he said $unc$mom you need to read it after i get finished
so maybe i will
i understand there was a really good basketball book called a season on the brink
i never heard that $unc$one
yeah
im not sure
i dont know
im trying to think of the guys name
it was like $unc$john $unc$feinstein or something like that wrote it
uh-huh
i just heard about it the other night
huh
i was listening to something on the radio about a talk show about sports books
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they mentioned that $unc$one
ill have to tell my son about that
im sure hed like it
yeah
and i was thinking about
i saw a book kicking around on the history of the $unc$a $unc$b $unc$a which
that would be good
yeah
even when i dont like the sport so much i get interested in the history of sports franchises
okay
all right
do you have any friends that have children
i do have friends that have children
yes
and what do they say about finding adequate child care
they
i think that may be the key word
i think thats correct
theyre relatively nonexistent from what i hear from my friends
it seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word still you have to deal with the people that happen to be operating it locally
right
and its just a matter of trust
i think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand
so its difficult for them
we certainly found that to be true
huh-uh
indeed weve
our children are now $unc$eleven and $unc$nine
huh-uh
and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that by that name and found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
huh-uh
right
right
huh-uh
huh-uh
at $unc$one point in time weve had $unc$au $unc$pairs by trading services with them
huh-uh
huh-uh
and that worked for a while
but adequate ones were really tough to find
im sure thats true
it takes that mixture of a very mature college student who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time and the interest to the children
huh-uh
right
right
i do have a friend that
she and her roommate became live-in care givers
and they loved it
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small $unc$four or $unc$five years old up until they were well into grade school
and she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
and they had done such a good job
so i can see where someone in a position like that in a live-in capacity would definitely be the way to go if youre lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that
thats true
yeah
and thats something that were struggling with now
yeah
i think its just a matter of priorities
its a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way
but you still have to be realistic as well i think
yeah
yeah
yeah
much as other cultures disagree our lives dont revolve around our children
yeah
yeah
and thats bad to have to admit too
but its just theres so much pressure when youre talking about $unc$two people that work outside the home
and i think that is $unc$one reason why i continue to be without children
i
its just such a responsibility and when ive had friends that have said
when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed
i realize thats true
so its such a responsibility
it certainly is
if i can the other side of the coin for a moment
huh-uh
it is such an honor and a thrill to be a parent that most of the time its worth it
yeah
huh-uh
yeah
most of the time
i just have to be honest about it
its not always worth it
yeah
sure
sure
sure
sure
there are those times when i think if i didnt have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
right
right
right
right
but its funny
i had a friend that said before we always said we dont want children because we cant go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
and she got older
and she said but we never do those things anyway
so why am i waiting
its just the way your attitude changes
and you mature i suppose
but the thing about the child care i have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work
its a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he as well
but they need the money
and when i seen some of my friends that have taken that $unc$six week old baby to someone else i can imagine how emotional it must be multiplied by the fact that you dont really trust the person or youre uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care
its just a scary thing
we were lucky when our children were that age
and having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
huh-uh
thats a big plus
and felt that feeling of safety
right
right
and were leaving them small children
huh-uh
but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
yeah
its that care givers are not omniscient
huh-uh
they are not all things to all people or all children
right
right
right
yeah
the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers
huh-uh
huh-uh
i think it takes a
i dont know
i think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older
i think that might be part of the problem with some people
taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing
but when you have them in their little feet are moving
and you have to chase them down constantly
im sure thats a whole new ball game
yeah
yeah
i have a $unc$nine year old that i would trade happily for a baby
really
you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about
since theyre both in school you dont have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them
you dont know what happens after they get in school
thats something altogether different
yes
we have $unc$one takes piano lessons somewhere on $unc$one afternoon
huh-uh
and the other one of course cant do the same thing
of course not
it has to be somewhere else
and no
its not adequate to sit and wait
you cant do that
no
no
no
no
that just
that will not do
thats out of the question
im sure
of course
but we are helping
right
right
we are being cooperative
whats wrong with you
right
right
you dont understand this
huh-uh
thats just the way their minds work
and its almost everyday
thats amazing
its amazing that people actually
the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it
it must be interesting
i guess you find out that youre a much stronger person than you thought maybe
ive been finding out that i really am a nice person
hit for many years
because i didnt need it
huh-uh
and now i need it
now its just a reservoir that you tend to regularly im sure
yeah
and it stays low a lot
are your children now
do you feel comfortable with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
or
absolutely not
no
yeah
$unc$one of them i would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
huh-uh
the other one i wouldnt leave unsupervised $unc$two minutes
yeah
yeah
thats just a difference in kids i suppose
thats true
yeah
what
$unc$one leads the other
huh-uh
yeah
and
and its the $unc$one thats going downhill
is it the $unc$one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one
of course
yeah
how unfortunate
you dont think that good prevails
im living in a dream world
what do i know
as i said i dont have kids
and im an only child
so ive never been around children
so im sort of at a loss where thats concerned
but i do hear my friends talk about it
were having such fun
my wife and i were both only children
huh-uh
and we just couldnt wait to have $unc$two children so they would be such friends
yeah
wrong
thats like $unc$world $unc$war $unc$three every minute
i dont know
i have to admit i was selfish as a child
i didnt want a brother or sister
and now that im older of course its different
i think about wouldnt it be nice
but
just make good friends
yeah
i have wonderful friends
thats true
my best friend is $unc$one child of $unc$ten
and so they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child
so that worked out pretty well
she never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them
so i guess thats an alternative
if you could just have a whole bunch
have enough
by the time the youngest ones are there youll have older one to take care of them
thats true
i dont know
when you see all these horror stories on television about child care
and gosh
i just
i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl thats been telling her mother these terrible stories
and of course people are denying it
and its just frightening
it really is
whats frightening is a parent to see things that you dont understand
huh-uh
huh-uh
and then you dont really know what happened
yeah
we gave up on $unc$one baby sitter because we came home $unc$one night and found pieces of hair ribbon tied in a chair where obviously she had
huh-uh
huh-uh
do you have any pets now
i sure do
i have a cat and a dog named $unc$joey
$unc$joey
the dog is $unc$joey
uh-huh
the cat is
hes the little boy $unc$pomeranian
my goodness
and we just got a new addition to the family so to speak
we also have a fish
my
its a mud dog
i beg your pardon
its a mud dog
its a cross between a catfish and i dont know what a salamander
oh
did you all catch it
or
uh-huh
we have a cat $unc$stripper
uh-huh
the mud dog
no
did
no
did you catch the fish
we had a friend give it to us
uh-huh
and its all alone in that aquarium
yeah
wed like to get him a friend
but we havent found $unc$one yet
so how about you
do you have any pets
at the present time i have $unc$two dogs
really
what kind
an $unc$english setter
thats the white dog with the feathers
and it has yellow spots on it which they call i think liver spots
uh-huh
uh-huh
and thats a male
and i have a wonderful female lab black lab
uh-huh
how long have you had them
quite a long time probably $unc$five or $unc$six years
and unfortunately the black lab thats a female its the most wonderful animal weve ever had
an i-
when she was about $unc$three years old we noticed that she was having problems limping and so forth
and she has hip dysplasia
uh-huh
no
and its in that breed
uh-huh
but now i think there are tests that can be conducted to tell whether or not the puppies have it
uh-huh
but i think
i dont know
apparently theyve been so i dont know inbred or what
but
is that right
n-
im not sure thats the situation
but it
for those dogs that are registered
and if you should have $unc$one that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it
huh
i had no idea
i didnt even know that
uh-huh
but shes wonderful
our dog $unc$joey has a back problem
ha-
what are the symptoms
hes got a bad back
but hes $unc$seven
i guess hes almost $unc$eight years old
he just
he doesnt
he rolls o-
he doesnt like to roll over
uh-huh
e-
you just
when you touch him a certain way on the back
yes
but otherwise he can jump just as long as he doesnt bend a certain way
i have had just wonderful luck with this $unc$lab
when i-
lets see winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold
uh-huh
and she wouldnt
i
the next morning you want to take them out
and she wouldnt
i couldnt get her up without picking her up which it was pretty hard to do at $unc$eighty pounds
i bet
until
if i allowed her to not get up on her own itd be $unc$two oclock in the afternoon
uh-huh
i met my sons college roommate is a vet
and he said lets give her some race horse shots
and in
im kind of glad to be able to tell people about this because you all the time run into people with problems
yeah
thats when we lived in $unc$oklahoma
so he gave this dog a series of
its
they give it to race horses to get rid of cartilage
uh-huh
and its called
its a series of $unc$six shots once a week
and then i noticed after $unc$two shots she was
do you have to give those
i could have
but i cant give a shot
i
believe me i understand
i took her from $unc$enid $unc$oklahoma to $unc$oklahoma $unc$city every week for $unc$six weeks
and after the second shot she was significantly better
then i didnt notice any improvement till after the sixth one
uh-huh
and ever since
and he said a booster every year or $unc$two maybe every $unc$six months or something like that
uh-huh
and when i notice in the winter when its worse its cold weather and so forth then i have gotten a booster for her
but not many people in this part of the country know anything about
ive had to get it from $unc$oklahoma
theyve heard about it
but theyve really never used it
uh-huh
yeah
ive never heard anything about it either
so dogs that get down in the hips
i think $unc$german $unc$shepherds do it and probably large dogs
uh-huh
and its just wonderful
does he get
is he an inside dog also
or does he just run out in the backyard
is he fenced in
were living now in an area where were in the woods
and we take walks
i just dont let them go away from me
yeah
uh-huh
but we take walks through the woods twice a day
thats nice
and i can over do it on her
yeah
but at least she can go
and shes not limping along and all that
uh-huh
tell me about your cat
$unc$stripper he started out being a little orphan
and we took him in
and hes about $unc$two years old now
and he loves his treats
both $unc$joey and $unc$stripper get treats
and lets see
and is $unc$stripper an inside cat or outside
hes outside
and hes got a way to get in
uh-huh
hes got free access of a window we like to keep open
yes
so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
of course
thats nice
they
$unc$joey on the other hand is a little different
he has to go out whenever we ask him
and when we ask him he barks
hell either bark for food or hell bark to go out
and hell tell you which $unc$one he wants
hes been through obedience school
he just can
he has been trained
and youve kept it up havent you
definitely
yeah
it is wonderful
i have some neighbors across the field
and they
when we first moved here when the dogs and i didnt fe-
we have a very nice kennel and everything
but since i didnt want to
i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
uh-huh
so i kept watch and never let them get away
but every couple weeks $unc$one would slip away
and my neighbor said to me i noticed those dogs are so well trained
anytime they hear your voice they come
so that made me very proud
yeah
have we been talking $unc$five minutes
im not for sure
im not either
but
i think maybe we have
but
yeah
it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
definitely
have you ever done this before
yes
okay
i havent ever called
ive put in the paper work i just never made the call
really
uh-huh
yeah
i didnt know if they stop you when the time is up
or
no
they dont
no
i glanced at the clock when we started
and i think its been probably about $unc$five and a half minutes or something
but $unc$one day i was talking to a lady about gardening
and i love gardening
and she did too
and after about $unc$twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape
uh-huh
at least you know you did your part
uh-huh
but its been so much fun too talk
how did you get into this
my best friend in virginias daughter is a part of this project in $unc$texas
i see
and so she knew that i had the time and would enjoy it
uh-huh
thats true
i
but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess
do you work
yes
i do
yeah
and probably just got home
uh-huh
so during the day i me-
i thi-
and i understand also they want men
right
i was going to tell you the same thing
theyre really looking for a lot more men to participate
yeah
my husband does
does he
yeah
i need to
yes
ive got some applications
i need to hand them out
but this is a great project that theyre working on
and its really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area
yes
i think so too
and i havent helped them out on men particularly
but my husband probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time
uh-huh
i try to make them during the day
but nobodys home
this is the perfect time for me
good
maybe ill get you next time
yeah
it so much fun to talk to you
all right
have a good one
you too
bye
bye
okay
i guess if i was having a dinner party depending on the number of people i might cook a brisket or a roast or maybe a chicken dish
uh-huh
and i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish
and we usually serve fresh fruit and then make a dessert
that sounds good
so that makes
were not real wealthy at the moment
last time i had people over for dinner we had lasagna
and i used my mothers recipe
i really like it
its got
you cook the noodles and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it
and im not sure she even puts
must be some italian spices in there
i cant remember
but for the cheese part you mix sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and layer all that
that sounds good
its good
that sounds good
and then tossed salad and
my goodness $unc$diane get down from there
and lets see
what else did i serve with that
bread do you have bread to go with it
corn
yeah
i made french bread with that $unc$one too
gosh
i have a recipe thats pretty good for that
so
lasagnas always wonderful for large crowds
yeah
ive heard a lot of people say the short cut on the cooking for lasagna
theyve told me that they go to sams and buy a great big pan of lasagna
ive heard that sams has a really good lasagna
in fact i think i had it at a party once
did you
it was good
i know people that have served it
and they say if you have company coming when you dont want to be always in the kitchen its easy
easy
and they said its good
yeah
so that always sounds good to me
yeah
i feel like im in the kitchen cooking a lot
i know
seems like i cook a lot of dinners not always for company just for family
yeah
so feels like im often in the kitchen
not my favorite place but a necessity
but a time consuming place
yeah
right
right
so
lets see
what else do we like to have for
trying to think what else i like to serve
my mother likes to serve taco grandes
have you ever had that
i dont know
what that is
no
i dont know what that is
you take a flour tortilla
and you fry it like a taco shell
okay
right
and you
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some tomato sauce in it
and i like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor
so you dont have to mess with spices and stuff
right
and then lets see
and you heat up refried beans
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese
and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first
then you put the meat
then you put the grated cheese
and then you put
lets see whats next
then i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce
right
and you can put guacamole and
$unc$katy im on the phone
get a towel or go change
im on the phone
a little sour cream is good and chopped olives
right
right
do you like to make your own guacamole
yeah
yeah
we dont make it very often i guess
but
no
i dont very often
usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain
do they
yeah
gosh
i just cut slices off
and i like an avocado sandwich too
gosh
thats good
thats good
or its always good on top of something in the sandwich
yeah
yeah
i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day
and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
what you want
where do they get it
i dont know
i guess they dont have it at home
i cant imagine it would stay fresh long enough to
i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe
they just said they never had it at home
so i was concerned that taking this as a dip i thought sometimes when we have it at home it turns dark on the top so quickly
yeah
so i just
it helps if you leave the pit in it
does that help
yeah
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while youre waiting before you serve it
okay
thats supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick
ill have to remember that
that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top
and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would
oh
so
thats good
i thought maybe that was the trick
that probably helps too
yeah
yeah
so i guess we bought a lot of
weve been buying turkey lately instead of beef
so
do you want it
even though
yeah
we have too
the ground turkey the meat is softer
and i
everybody seems to like it
do you want scrambled
so sometimes it seems to be cheaper too
so we often buy it
yeah
yeah
we buy it
if you get it on sale
yeah
yeah
so we bought that
or we bought the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets
and i dont think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them
yeah
yeah
or in
i dont think mine know either
in fact weve been getting lunch meat thats turkey too
it costs less than the other
i dont know
theres supposed to be something more healthy about it
yeah
yeah
poultry instead of the beef and pork
yeah
right
right
i guess thats probably all we need to do for tonight
yeah
i cant think of any other specific things i like to serve
i always like dessert
$unc$one salad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a
i dont know what you call it
you mix cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of $unc$cool $unc$whip
right
right
thats good and quick and easy
thats always good
probably the only family recipe that we make and its really for special occasions is cheese cake
and we take a recipe from my grandmother
uh-huh
its probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
this is the season for vacations
and i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors somewhere
someplace thats very different than $unc$texas
right
and i
maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like going somewhere where its not so hot and being able to be outside enjoy outside activities
so
yeah
enjoy going places where
i enjoy playing tennis
so i like to have a tennis court there
or if its at the beach the beach is great
a pool is great
and i
where do you usually go
lets see
we have plans this year to drive up to $unc$colorado
uh-huh
and we will be going to $unc$estes $unc$park and $unc$colorado $unc$springs
so
uh-huh
$unc$one year we went to the southwest corner of $unc$colorado into $unc$durango and north of the area there
uh-huh
and i
boy thats a nice place to visit
its really nice at
theres a nice train ride that goes up to the city of $unc$silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
right
and then north of that is another town on a smaller scale i guess than $unc$silverton
and then theres lots and lots of mountains that are covered with boulders
uh-huh
so i guess people jeep through that area
and we did not have a chance to do that
but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
right
we have not had a vacation in several years
so be our first chance in awhile
we are going to go to $unc$destin $unc$florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it
i have not been
but i have heard its wonderful
its gorgeous
we used to go quite a bit before i moved out here
we were closer and used to go almost every summer and rent a condo there on the beach
theres a lot of development of condominiums there on the beach front
right
so they are very large condos
and they have quite a few rooms so we will usually rent $unc$one for about a week or so
and
right
and the beach is nice
go down
oh
the beach is really nice isnt it
yes
its beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of nice waves usually
oh
sea shells
enough to make it
i am sorry
sea shells
theres not as many sea shells along there
thats the only thing that they really do not
they have some but not so much
yeah
if you go further down you will usually find some but not right in there
i do not know why it is
but it just
it seems not to have as many right there
but we enjoy it
its
we usually stay at the same place every year
and they are like i say right on the beach
so
where do you stay
my husband always wants to go to $unc$destin
we just have not gone that direction yet
its a place called $unc$jetty $unc$east $unc$j $unc$e $unc$t $unc$t $unc$y $unc$e $unc$a $unc$s $unc$t
and its called that because its at the very end of a jetty there which is sort of at the end of this little point
okay
and its at the very end
its the last set of condominiums there
and its very nice
its not very expensive
you can
i think we are going to go with another couple and their kids
and we have a i think its $unc$three bedroom or $unc$two bedroom condominium which will sleep i do not know quite a few about $unc$six or $unc$eight and cause its got pull out couches and all that
right
and i think its going to cost us per couple about $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars for the week
thats nice
yeah
it really is
because it has got its own full size kitchen and everything
great
and this $unc$one i think has $unc$two baths
and its
the $unc$one we got is on the beach side
so
nice
we have got a beautiful view and balcony
and just
its really a nice stay
in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon
i had won a trip to the $unc$bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time
so we instead went there and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the $unc$bahamas
in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked
oh
the particular suite we had gotten was very nice
and so we decided to stay
great
oh
but its a pretty nice place
you will need to try to go and stay there sometime
we have just
its a little far from here
but
are you driving
yeah
we are
we are
it will take a day and a half to get there probably
oh
so
we are
the neighborhood that we live they are switching to an alternate calendar this year
so it
starting at the end of $unc$july we will have $unc$two vacation weeks in $unc$october and $unc$two vacation weeks in $unc$march
uh-huh
so that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family
so i
what does that mean alternate
its
what it truly is supposed to mean is $unc$nine weeks of school $unc$three weeks of vacation $unc$nine weeks of school $unc$three weeks of vacation
oh
uh-huh
and in the summer would be more like a $unc$two month break
right
and they hope to boost the learning of the children just the retention of the material for them
i see
so
kind of scattering the vacation throughout the year
yeah
yeah
yeah
so its
so maybe within a year we will see how that falls
right
we will head for $unc$florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
right
okay
thats probably all we need to do today
okay
alright
so long
thanks a lot
bye-bye
all right
and your occupation is teaching
im a substitute teacher
substitute teacher
is this $unc$pat im talking to now
yes
it is
yeah
im a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in
right
i was just trying to make an introduction here
okay
and i havent told you im going to be at a different school this year
oh
ive just gotten another job at an elementary library at $unc$barron
i bet you may dress differently then for that
right
i
not really
every day ive got to read to kindergartners
so im going to be down on the floor with them
ive got about $unc$forty kindergartners im going to be working with every day for a half hour
so ill probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because if im going to be down on the floor messing with them im not going to wear nice nylons and dresses
what i wear sometimes depends on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since im a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater
right
of course youve been at $unc$clark enough that you know its always cold
yes
but you dont know i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless youve been there
no
you try to layer so you can add or take off
subtract
right
and its interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual
i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools
thats $unc$one of the things i ask about whether she would allow slacks
and she said she doesnt have a problem with that
she just didnt like sloppy dressing
uh-huh
and i said that was okay
and im
basically i wear slacks year round except about once a week i try to wear a skirt
and in the winter i maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer
uh-huh
thats about
i dont really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and look really
right
and for me sometimes they even have dress up days
or they have spirit week that you wear your different outfits
yeah
and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in spirit week
right
and $unc$one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat
and you never know that though sometimes when youre going in do you
no
but because i sort of stick to several schools im usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and might remember to do it
right
right
and then many schools on a particular day during i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for game day which
right
on what $unc$thursday
right
it might be $unc$thursday for the high schools
and it may be $unc$friday for the senior high schools
right
right
so that would kind of give you a clue i guess
and sometimes you get the long term stuff
so youre aware ahead of time of whats going on
yeah
that
so thats
and i dont know
i think about the dress code they have for the kids
are
they put $unc$one on the parents or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties
and there can be no blue jeans worn
and because some of the teachers i know wear dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that theyve had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
uh-huh
and theyll wear it with a nice top
and i dont know that that looks that bad
but if youre going to tell the kids they have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
yeah
it
i see that the
i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers i think
uh-huh
but i think it varies just so much
anything can go
uh-huh
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at $unc$clark theyre all pretty fancy
but theyre just sort of into clothes
and then theres other departments that arent
right
right
right
and theyll just wear your common ordinary whatever you might say
yeah
theres a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others
right
right
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know youre going there
you dont want to dress too tacky because youre going to be in the same room with them
right
and you always
course its a standing joke when the men come in a tie and a suit coat you say what have you got a job interview today
or theres usually something going on that would cause that to happen
or youre going to be observed
yeah
and i dont know how a coach would feel that teaches health or $unc$english or whatever that they had to wear a tie
i
some of those male coaches that might really
right
they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants
right
and a t-shirt
right
that i didnt ever understand
weve got coaches that teach health for $unc$five periods and then have athletics sixth period
so
yeah
well at vines the coaches dont do that
whether
they dress pretty good i would say
and then they go to their coaching
and they put their shorts on there
change then
thats what i would think
uh-huh
thats what i would think
but they dont wear their sweat pants or anything
they dress like any other teacher would in a classroom situation not in p e
right
course we had $unc$one coach $unc$one period hed teach p e and the next period $unc$health and then a period of p e
those i can understand
and thats hard
yeah
so he just left warm-ups on
but no
i think really probably they could really
and i dont know if they make uniforms the thing for the kids
i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top
and
i dont think well ever get to that
you dont think so
no
i dont think
i think were going the opposite direction
its the parochial schools that i guess many ti-
theyve had uniforms for years
i dont really know if they still do
some of them yes they do
and its not at some of the private schools
it certainly makes it easier to dress
but even theres a couple public schools in $unc$dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers dress in accordance with that
uh-huh
its certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you dont have to be concerned about your wardrobe
uh-huh
i think it would make a difference at school
i dont think we should be spending time saying somebodys wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too short
or theyve got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high
its a lot of trouble to take care of that
uh-huh
and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want
and yet we cant to that either
id like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform but saying that theyve got to wear a button down shirt
that would alleviate any t-shirts with sayings on them
but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
and
yeah
but i doubt that that will come about
and then the girls
just
right
yeah
i
i dont
no
not in $unc$plano
no
not
they may get a-
yeah
but they said in the $unc$dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
i think it does
it takes their minds off of trying to compete
$unc$highland parks thinking about going that route
uh-huh
so it
and then i think thats going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
yeah
i dont think a lot of teachers are very professional
but
yeah
i agree with you on
hi
good morning
good morning
do you have recycling in $unc$sachse
yes
we do
weve got a pickup twice a week that they come out
do
and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
and they take it
really
uh-huh
and its twice a week
uh-huh
really
we have recently started a bin program here in $unc$plano where
used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up
and now they have these large green containers
and you have to put your trash that you dont recycle in there
and then they havent started curbside recycling yet
but theyre planning on doing it very soon
apparently the trucks that they had lined up they needed the parts for $unc$saudi $unc$arabia
oh
and so that put off the program for a while
but do you recycle
my kids do
do they
uh-huh
put it that way
theyve been recycling cans for extra money
uh-huh
uh-huh
so thats been their summer money
and theyre fixing to go to $unc$disneyland
so
thats great
yeah
thats the way we started too
my daughter was going to $unc$camp $unc$goddard which is through the $unc$plano school system in the fall couple of years ago
uh-huh
and she had to earn money for it
and she was too young to baby-sit
so thats how she started
she started recycling cans
and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and aluminum cans and plastics
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go
and they weigh it or whatever
and
no
the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans
the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling
and so we dont get paid for that
but thats okay
yeah
its not that much of a bother really
you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever
and we use a lot of $unc$two liter bottles and milk cartons and things like that
its amazing how much plastic you generate
yeah
i was amazed at how many cans that we got
yeah
yeah
because when the kids first went down i said thats great
and i was thinking maybe id help supplement it when they turned them in
uh-huh
but its amazing how many cans you go through and how fast they accumulate
yeah
it really is
all that stuff
and how much we have reduced our waste that were generating a week
uh-huh
i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said theres no way were going to have to have pickup twice a week
they were real upset
but they were only picking up once a week
and we said to them if you recycle youll go $unc$two weeks without having to put out the green container
yeah
and its really amazing
the other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we dont collect our grass clippings
really
no
he got a little mulcher thing
uh-huh
its just a little attachment for the lawn mower
and we mow once a week
no more often then that
and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the lawn
and its amazing
its amazing
we dont collect any of that
and that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
yeah
we dont catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard
so if it gets mowed i do it normally
uh-huh
and i cant mow the yard with the grass catch on it
its too heavy
yeah
so i just mow it and leave it
yeah
it just soaks in
sure it does
sure it does
it really does
and it
they say that youre wasting fertilizer catching your grass clippings
uh-huh
thats that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn
its amazing
yeah
yeah
yeah
i like it better doing it
$unc$one
it cuts down on my mow time anyway
uh-huh
thats true
and you zip through it quicker
thats true
thats true
i really think youre going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it
we probably will
its really not that much trouble
we keep garbage bag in the garage
yeah
and as soon as we use something we crush it up and put it out there
and then every few weeks we have a recycling center near $unc$wal-mart
uh-huh
they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in
and its really no trouble
and i feel like at least were doing something
yeah
i read a magazine article
and they said something about how you dont realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution
but its not
if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day just from not throwing out your newspapers
really
and when you read that you think maybe it is a big deal
what makes me sick is when they show the dump sites and how big they are
uh-huh
uh-huh
or like in $unc$new $unc$york the barges that go up and down the river
yes
yeah
and they dont have any place to put it
and it just floats in the
its ugh
yeah
yeah
yeah
and thats really not necessary
no
it really isnt
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference
it would make a huge impact
so im excited about the recycling program in $unc$plano
i cant wait for them to get it started because itll be that much easier for us
like i said now we have to take it over to $unc$wal-mart
it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up
yeah
its convenient out here for them to do it
what do they pick up
its just
they pick up the plastic the glass and the newspaper
they do
uh-huh
uh-huh
and do you have to sort that
and they will do the alum-
or do you just put it all in
no
you just put it in the $unc$one bin
and i guess they do the sorting
but theyll do the aluminum cans too
but we dont give them those
right
right
the kids keep those
so
so youre doing that now
youre doing the newspapers and the glass
uh-huh
we dont take the newspaper to begin with when neither $unc$one of us are home to read it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so we dont have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass
at first when it first started it was hard because youre just used to throwing things
uh-huh
my husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away
uh!
he would get all upset
and id say
its just such an automatic reaction
and now we think before we throw anything away
it is
its really funny
we really
once you get into the habit of it its okay
its just making it a habit thats hard
i know
the kids have even got to the point where if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can theyre no dont do that
and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain
and then after a couple of days they take them all outside
uh-huh
and i put them in a big bag anyway
uh-huh
and then they dump the bag out
and then they crush them
so thats their activity thing to go out there and crush
uh-huh
thats fun
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats a lot of fun
yeah
thats a lot of fun
thats great
im to hear youre doing that
i
my sister was here recently from $unc$connecticut
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
really
okay
where do you live
in $unc$plano
in $unc$plano
yes
where do you live
in $unc$dallas
okay
the air pollution isnt too bad in our area
so were very fortunate but i know in some areas it really is bad
huh
i was trying to think
something we were watching the other day
and they were doing an overview of $unc$los $unc$angeles from an area that was up higher
and you literally could see the band of smog
that
ive never been out there
but it was quite evident that it was a real brown area
i havent either
uh-huh
and
i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that bad
yeah
particularly in the areas where there are industries where they are burning a lot of coal and oil more up north i guess
yes
yeah
i think its a bigger problem with the car pollution anti-pollution devices
i think air isnt as bad it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area
yes
i know thats been the concern in $unc$europe
they hadnt
we have friends in $unc$germany and have family that live near the $unc$black $unc$forest area
and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we switched to the unleaded gas and had the emission control devices required on the cars
thats something that $unc$europe didnt do right away
and now theyre doing that
and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country thats the only pollution thats been there
its not an area that is industry
but they were losing a lot of trees and a lot of
from acid rain
i guess from something that the car was giving
i think in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere and form a weak acid
yes
and
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side
and after a period of time i think that accumulates in trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces
youve seen what its done to buildings even where its really bad
yes
yeah
whats interesting several years ago i took a course on
it was put on by the power companies about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was
and there wasnt from various kinds of energy
and at that point in time $unc$one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain
and it was kind of pooh-poohed
youre making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing
and its turned out that thats been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage
so its kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course
now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear
im not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that they use is not bomb quality
and were so strict with all our controls in the $unc$united $unc$states the chances of an accident are slight
and it doesnt pollute the air at all
its safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants
its kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear
yes
so i dont know
in $unc$europe theres a lot of dependency on nuclear power
and they recycle the fuel
and then instead of
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because theyre afraid it could become bomb quality
but thats the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as im concerned where it could eventually perhaps theres some problem pollute the groundwater
so i dont know what the answer is
the best answer of course would be solar or fusion or something clean
yes
weve got a problem on the line dont we
yeah
i get that sometimes
my line gets some static
i dont know why
uh-huh
but solar of course would be the cleanest
i know its
we did have a solar water heater when we lived in $unc$houston
and oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal
i cant hear you at all for all this static
i dont know what to
usually its the other phone i have trouble with
it must just be on the line
can you hear me
now i can again
okay
i dont know what the problem is
but when we lived in $unc$houston we had a solar water heater
and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
and we have enough clouds that there are other areas that would be better suited
that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of sunny days
uh-huh
and it
yes
it can be used
and it can help
but that was a problem that they were still working on
but
yeah
its still got a long way to go
i
its just a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways
yes
it may not in all ways
maybe theyll come up with fusion be able to control it
i dont know how long thatll take
but $unc$one of these days
because thats perfectly clean
yes
its just we cant control it
right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out
so it isnt not at all
and you cant control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field
so thats not going to work at least not now
but who knows what the future will hold as far as energy goes
i think with solving some of the future energy problems well probably solve some of the pollution problems as well
i hope so
i do to
i like to be optimistic
i dont like to be pessimistic about these things
i do think
youve already mentioned several things i think just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in
we have $unc$one earth to live on
yes
and we got to take care of it
yes
and for the future generations too
uh-huh
ive noticed young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth
yes
and so if we can raise generations with those concerns well solve a lot of our problems
im afraid
i know i was part of the me generation where people didnt care
its whatever
recycle if its a problem forget that
not throw the trash out the car window
and leave it in the car and then throw it away
how horrible
ive always done those kinds of things because i just didnt like messes
and
how do you feel about capital punishment
its
i am pretty much against it
really
yeah
how about you
im pretty much for it
good
we can have a debate
well have some interesting discussion i guess
i dont know
i think that i
$unc$one of the reasons that im against it is that im afraid of someone losing their life wrongly
wrongfully
yeah
right
yeah
and another reason
but $unc$one of the arguments that really made me feel kind of strongly against it is that someone said to me once imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldnt you want to see them killed for the punishment
but then i thought about it
and i thought the loss that i would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them
yeah
it would never be equal
right
right
yeah
how about you
i guess i can see it from several different perspectives
but when i hear about things like what theyve been reporting about in $unc$milwaukee to me i dont see any way of rehabilitating the guy
maybe there is i dont know
yeah
thats true
and hes never going to be to me a functioning part of society
hes already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
uh-hum
i dont know
i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko
and for the things hes done
i dont know
i guess its either put him in jail for the rest of his life or capital punishment i guess
right
thats true because a lot of these conversations ive had on this program these telephone conversations have revolved around criminal justice
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
or
and most of the time i hear myself saying we dont have enough room left in the jails
and people crime is still climbing
and we need to have different punishments
right
but i just am scared of capital punishment i guess
you know there is always that chance
but i guess to some people itd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i dont know
but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be
you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they wont do that for any situation really
but when you find somebody just like that situation it was disgusting when i read about it today
and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing $unc$eleven i guess i have a hard time feeling merciful toward him
uh-huh
and
right
especially when its so far removed
if its no $unc$one that i know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life
right
right
and trying to rehabilitate him too
and
letting him out again
right
exactly
and nobody wants that
uh-huh
everybody would be just as scared to death
weve had a real problem here in $unc$texas with prison overcrowding
and theyve been releasing people left and right
and theyve committed murders and rapes and everything else
and you just think wheres the justice here
uh-huh
theyre not even having to serve out what they should be serving
thats true
i just recently moved to $unc$massachusetts
im not sure what their policy is on capital punishment
and that was $unc$one of the questions
but i do know that they are notorious for paroling people
really
yeah
when
and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes
uh-huh
yeah
and i guess they said do you think it should be restricted
i guess if
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment
uh-huh
i guess violent crimes would be the crimes where i can see it making the most sense
yeah
violent crimes with just malicious intent
right
exactly
yeah
thats exactly im not saying i think capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case especially because there are some cases when you just dont know
and i think theres a shadow of a doubt like with this guy in $unc$milwaukee
it
he pretty much confessed to it
they
just everything cannibalism and everything else
yeah
hang
because thats just awful
and what is he going to do prison to the other people
right
i have a hunch that the other prisoners arent going to be too happy with him anyway either
they
i dont know
from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live
right
but i dont know its just
i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back
she was off drugs and everything
uh-huh
but she said in prison you can get anything
you can any drugs you want
theres
its just like being outside
people find ways around
really
and theres a power structure that you have bow to
and for some people who have been there for over and over and over it really isnt as bad
theres
its not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect
yeah
yeah
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
and maybe thats $unc$one of the reasons why crime has gone up because its not so scary anymore
yeah
that
yeah
especially like repeat offenders
it just appalls me that they even get a $unc$ten year sentence and be out in $unc$two or $unc$three or $unc$four years
thats scary because im not sure i think were paroling them without even knowing if theyre going to be committing any more violent acts or not
right
and what theyre going to be doing when they get out
right
and its really scary
i me-
i dont know what the perfect solution to that is
but i know that especially with violent crimes where youre nearly a $unc$hundred percent convinced that theyre guilty and without much repentance or anything else then i dont know i guess i just really dont see much use for this guy in $unc$milwaukee
for instance thats just
i could see capital punishment in a case like that and for other people too that do things like that
but when
my wife and i are both participating in this survey
and she picked up the phone
and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment
so she was
handed it to you
yeah
luckily it was for me because they coordinate the times so it can only be $unc$one or the other
i see
so she tried to enter her number
and it wouldnt work
so she said whew its for you
but i dont know
i struggle with it
but i really think that in terms of this i think that it might not be such a bad thing because i dont know that anybody would feel good if you let someone like that loose in your community
im su-
youd have to be scared to death
maybe if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation
deep down i think every human
okay
do you subscribe to magazines yourself
i dont subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that i need to read that i just dont take any at home
i see
i get mccalls
of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since thats my main line of interest
uh-huh
and then once in a while ill pick up a $unc$working $unc$woman or something and realize why i dont want to go back to work what i enjoy about staying home
uh-huh
right
and i read magazines mainly because theyre fast
and if i want to relax while i watch t v
of course im $unc$one of those that does $unc$two things at once
and i read $unc$good $unc$housekeeping and $unc$better $unc$homes and mccalls
and i like them because theyre kind of short and to the subject
right
i used to take mccalls and $unc$good $unc$housekeeping and several magazines like that a few years ago at home
uh-huh
and then you stopped them all
but yeah
the subscriptions ran out
and i never renewed them
and i found that i really didnt have time at home since i work to read them
i find that about $unc$two years is probably my max on subscribing to $unc$one in particular
uh-huh
and then i kind of get turned off by it other than $unc$good $unc$housekeeping
uh-huh
$unc$good $unc$housekeeping is the $unc$one that kind of sets around for when im really have time and i really want to read something
uh-huh
i dont get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with on a general basis
uh-huh
and we travel a lot
so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various different ones
uh-huh
right
and i get into newspapers
so i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am
im read it fast and put it down
right
uh-huh
when i had my magazines at home i would find that i kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures
and if something caught my eye then i might read something
right
but otherwise than that they were not too useful to me
thats what i do
i got some good recipes from them sometimes
but
you clip recipes
and you save them forever
and you never really use them
uh-huh
thats right
thats right
and then every so often you weed through them
and you think where did i ever put that recipe
right
but thats mainly my whole idea on short subject reading and things like this
uh-huh
i subscribe like i said to a few
and once in a while i buy that new magazine called $unc$first on the newsstands or something like that
uh-huh
but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what pertains to my daily life at the present time
right
since i work with computers during my work i have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything
and i have to read the magazines such as $unc$byte and $unc$computer $unc$world and $unc$mac $unc$world and all of these magazines such as that
so i really just
i can see that it will be a very long time probably before i subscribe to any magazines at home
right
sometimes if youre in public transportation i know that people will read them on something like that
uh-huh
right
but i think
and the idea is good
i can just dump them at the other end
and i dont have to carry them back with me
thats right
i do that when we travel
i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we
uh-huh
no matter what it is air travel or anything and i
uh-huh
right
if i go on an airplane ride or something ill stop in and pick up a $unc$cosmopolitan or something to read on the airplane
right
although now
but thats basically just about
ill buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then
thats when you really have time
your computer ones
i got into computer work somewhat
we have our own computer system at home
uh-huh
and i tried reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it
and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as i went along
uh-huh
it was kind of a little bit more than what i needed
so i never did get into them
when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail
i think they all thought we have a live one shell subscribe
uh-huh
but they were wrong
i never got into them
but okay
right
i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point
okay
it was nice talking with you
it was nice to talk with you too
okay
thank you
uh-huh
bye
bye-bye
do you have any hobbies
yes
i do
what are yours
$unc$china painting and ceramics
how great
i enjoy it
uh-huh
ceramic painting
i enjoy the china more
the china more
and now that i have my eyes corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting i do enjoy it
how did you ever get into that
that sounds so interesting
my husband kept begging me
and hes been dead now for $unc$twenty years
so you understand that this was a long time ago
but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons
how marvel-
i
and i said ill do it for $unc$three months
and if i dont like it thats it
i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years
and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable self-satisfying thing ive had
i
do you do it just for yourself
or do you do it to give as gifts
or do you actually sell it
i have sold quite a bit
i give a lot to our $unc$two daughters that are grown and have their home
and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it
uh-huh
that sounds mar-
do you work outside of the home
i have just retired
youve just retired
yes
what a great hobby
no
its not
i
its a great hobby
but dont retire
dont retire
i dont
i never returned to work for the p-
i have stayed home for about the last $unc$nine years
have
weve transferred around
and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake on $unc$lake $unc$erie
so the lake life appealed to me
and my husbands working
and he left it up to me if i worked or not
wow
so in my spare time i love to sew
there arent too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing
but i do make all my own clothes
and we recently purchased a new home
so i enjoy doing my toppers for my window applications and things like that
uh-huh
but just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great
my sister is the seamstress of the $unc$two of us
but she doesnt china paint
so we both have our expertise side
that is excellent
what part of $unc$ohio are you in
im in the suburb of $unc$cleveland
and im about $unc$fifteen miles probably from downtown $unc$cleveland something like that
and $unc$cleveland is located right on $unc$lake $unc$erie
and prior to this we were $unc$fifty miles west from here
so we were right on the lake
and $unc$cleveland isnt all as bad as what youve heard
whats that
and you do find people into the crafts and various things for spare time
but i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting
and im just intrigued with it
if you ever start be sure and start with a large flat plate
that way you can get the feel of
youre not cramped on these smaller objects
right
where youre getting into the delicate work
thats right
where did you first get your lessons from
in $unc$abilene $unc$texas
through an adult ed or strictly a china type
she just taught china painting
uh-huh
and
how marvelous
then we had so much fun there
i had a friend from $unc$albany which is about $unc$thirty-six miles away
and we would meet every $unc$thursday morning at our instructors home because she did our firing for us
and she would help us
and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies
and it was just such a delightful time
and then after i
and its so nice
beg pardon
it must be so nice for you now that youre retired
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husbands death
so i have put it aside for a little while
but i have just found me an instructor to get started again
uh-huh
isnt that great
and youll probably really regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a class again
uh-huh
of course i just have $unc$one beautiful with peonies umbrella stand
and i have $unc$two daughters
and theyre both
what is your practice as far as budgeting
do you manage the money
we talk about it
but im usually the $unc$one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and tries to somehow make the ends meet which
i see
thats how kind of i am too
are you married
yes
you are
yes
i think the women for the most part end up managing the money
my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns
it
i dont mind the spending
its just that trying to get what you need out of what you have
that seems to be our challenge
i dont work outside of the home
and he always threatens that when i spend more than whats coming in i have to go back to work
i see
so i manage it
im at home also
so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on $unc$one salary
do you actually follow a budget
we pretty well do
several years we didnt
and we found that we just werent making the most of what we had
and so we set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for
just our bills
and then whats left we divvy up
we try to save a little bit although were not always successful
and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs
thats pretty much the way we did in the past
i would say
at this point our children are grown
and so i really dont have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to get things together for them
yeah
right
and i really just keep very good records
and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that
and i try to keep my $unc$mastercards and things paid currently
right
uh-huh
i dont always succeed at that
i usually keep $unc$one with a low interest rate
and i put things on there that i think im not going to get to
right
and then i have another $unc$one
but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point were in a new home and they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
yeah
so im still getting used to that
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how were going to pay for it ahead
right
and we do not buy us new cars
do you get into car
we had new cars always until about $unc$four years ago
my husband owned his own company and it went under
and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment
and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car
he has a company car also
but for our personal car we have a used car
do you think that its wiser to buy used
we do for us very much so
in fact we are in a position that most of our friends wonder why we just dont go to a new car whatever
and i said look you guys are all into car payments
right
we havent had car payments for so many years
i love it this way
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked
and it has $unc$eighty-two $unc$thousand miles on it
uh-huh
and we kept saying wouldnt it be great if we could find another $unc$one just like it
believe it or not we did we found $unc$one $unc$one newer
no
the worst part is its the same color
uh-huh
and so everybodys saying youre kidding you have $unc$two cars the same
and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again
thats right
i said we had $unc$one and we found $unc$one with just $unc$seventeen $unc$thousand miles on it
wow
and its an $unc$eighty-five
and so i said hey this was a cinch
we paid for the car
and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
right
this is for all the long running back and forth on interstate driving and things
and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably
do you buy from dealers or from individuals
generally from dealers
and it depends because i dont like to sell what were trading in to an individual unless we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell
right
right
we were going up to a larger one
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer we always make a deal
i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying dont bring us the manager and all of that unless you want to bring him right away
youre going to get $unc$one shot at us
yeah
we will
and they say youre kidding
i s-
no
this is the price were going to give you out the door
we dont want to hear about taxes
okay
i guess our topic is advice about going to college
uh-huh
do you have children of your own
no
i dont have any children
but im still going to college
are you
uh-huh
what school are you going to
$unc$n $unc$c $unc$state
are you enjoying it
its a lot of work
are you working on your bachelors degree
my bachelors
uh-huh
and what field of study are you in
its actually in computer science
uh-huh
and i have a special interest in $unc$voice $unc$i $unc$o
thats neat
are you from $unc$north $unc$carolina
no
im actually from $unc$amarillo $unc$texas originally
are you really
uh-huh
what took you to $unc$north $unc$carolina
the service
i see
yeah
that was $unc$one of the things i was thinking about in school
i went to $unc$texas $unc$tech out in $unc$lubbock and i had a friend my roommate went to $unc$tech also
uh-huh
but she was from $unc$new $unc$mexico
uh-huh
and she had to pay out of state tuition
ooh
and i think that would have played a real big part of my decision
it would have played a major part in mine
because she was pay-
of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now
it was like $unc$four dollars a semester hour
uh-huh
and so i was going to school for just a few $unc$hundred dollars a semester
and she was paying $unc$forty dollars an hour
golly
so she paid $unc$ten times as much because she was out of state
yeah
luckily ive paid in state tuition the whole time
thats good
yeah
so i think that would be $unc$one thing i would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that i liked well enough to attend
uh-huh
uh-huh
the second thing is some colleges only offer the liberal arts whereas like $unc$state they offer engineering courses
uh-huh
right
yeah
so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to attend somewhere like $unc$tech
yeah
right
and aside from the
some schools may even give you financial aid where another one wont
yeah
thats true
that was something else i had was i had government aid of course
but it was wonderful because i got $unc$one of those grants that you dont have to repay
really
and yeah
it was so nice
it paid most of my tuition and a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing
so
wow thats great
yeah
i really
was it a $unc$pell grant
im sorry what did you say
what kind of grant was it
it was called a $unc$b $unc$e $unc$o $unc$g a $unc$basic $unc$equal $unc$opportunity $unc$grant
uh-huh
and it was from the government
and at first it was based on my parents income
my parents had $unc$five children and really didnt make enough money to send any of us to school
uh-huh
and so because based on the number of children and the amount of money my father brought in i got a small grant
uh-huh
but then after that i was on my own working and trying to go to school on my own
so then i got a real big grant because the amount of money i was making really didnt compare
wow
uh-huh
so it was kind of nice
i dont know if those are still available or not
but
im not quite
theres a lot of different organizations who do give grants
but im not exactly sure which ones they are and how much they generally run
yeah
yeah
this was great
it was just based on how much your tuition costs and everything
and generally it paid everything
so i went to school about $unc$three years of my $unc$four for almost nothing
uh-huh
so that was
thats great
yeah
it was really nice
another thing
ive got a degree from another college
uh-huh
and something that might play a part is the size of the college
right
the smaller schools can give you a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools
uh-huh
yeah
in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy
and they just give you a teachers assistants
uh-huh
uh-huh
instead of a scholar you get a t a
thats right
and you dont get near the quality of education
and as well the smaller schools often times dont cost as much
i didnt know that
yeah
i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between a christian college because i thought about attending $unc$abilene $unc$christian instead of $unc$texas $unc$tech
uh-huh
uh-huh
and of course the price was just astronomical compared to $unc$tech
the christian college was so much more expensive
but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different
at $unc$state i think its just a waste of somebodys money to go there
really
its really a shame because of the instruction
yeah
id rather go to any other college in the state
and i would definitely get my moneys worth much better than $unc$state
yeah
its kind of unfortunate because theyve just grown so big that they just dont care about the students any more
yeah
yeah
youre just a number
yeah
theyre bent on seeing how much more land they can get and how much of the campus they can build up
right
and
yeah
yeah
its really a bad situation here
thats a shame
i felt a little cheated at $unc$tech also
once i got into my
i majored in
what do you feel is the major change thats been going on
thats a tough question
we are now able to work full $unc$eight hours a day and still do our housework right
dont ask me
i think that has been the major change is that women feel they need to go out and do this
they no longer feel its no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more
it has no credibility any more
i know it
and i think thats really sad because i think theres going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
im a school teacher
and im in charge of raising them
so i can appreciate it
you dont
im still home with my last one
and i wouldnt change a minute of it for anything
good for you
good for you
but i cant help but think that eventually the pendulums going to swing back the other way again
its interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking
this summer $unc$oprah had a t v show about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible
uh-huh
and $unc$one woman had $unc$four children
and her husband said she wasnt pulling her own weight in the family
yeah
thats
thats frightening
yeah
its sad
and it from the audience participation it was almost a social issue
uh-huh
people were siding with the husband saying youve got to go to work if you have these $unc$four children youve got to support them
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
uh-huh
yeah
i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary
thats true
to
i dont think the kids dont benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing
i think that they would from the attention or whatever
thats true
it
i dont know
i see it as a major problem
and i think its going to have to swing back the other way because i think were going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
yeah
as i said i teach school
uh-huh
and im trying to think
i dont know
i have $unc$one mother that i know is home
but she also has $unc$ten children
what grade do you teach
$unc$six $unc$seven and $unc$eight
$unc$six $unc$seven and $unc$eight
ive got a chi-
where do you live
are you out
in $unc$richardson
in $unc$richardson
were in $unc$plano here
okay
i have a daughter in middle school
and i know there arent very many
she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home
but do you ever see problems that you feel that the kids are left alone too much
yeah
and
ive got $unc$one child that stays with me every day until $unc$five because his mother doesnt come home until $unc$seven
and he doesnt want to be home from $unc$three $unc$thirty until $unc$seven by himself
he stays at school
uh-huh
and the school allows that
he stays with me
uh-huh
and i have a tendency to work late
i work until $unc$six
uh-huh
so he stays with me until $unc$five $unc$thirty and then goes home
my
and i have lots of kids because they know im there late
uh-huh
im a slow mover to say the least
but theyll come in and say can i stay with you because i dont want to go home to an empty house
and thats frightening because the
when i said im raising them i am
because were talking about boy friends
and were talking about what the girl said in class
and whats right because theres no mother at home
uh-huh
no mother to talk to
and it makes a difference
i
and just the social values
ive just
do you feel it will swing back the other way
or do you feel theres just going to be a big push for more and more day care type situations
i dont know
i have a feeling were going to go more and more
ive got a $unc$twenty-one year old female
and ive got $unc$twenty-two year old male children
and i listen to my daughter
and shes going to work
and shes going to buy her house
and shes going to get her car
and then shes going to have her children
and then when they go on $unc$one salary will they be able to sustain what their life-style is
uh-huh
and theyre back to work
and i agree with you
i was raised in a generation we didnt need all those things
yeah
and we lived without them
we did fine
okay
ive got a
i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing
and then thats get rid of the half of the government payroll
i think that would probably be very possible
and we really wouldnt feel it in our services
not all
i dont know if youve ever been to $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
yes
i have
youve seen that which was on there and the offices
and in light of these hearings weve all been sitting through the last $unc$two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed
right
they really dont have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what theyre doing
right
and the other thing is besides that i think $unc$two things that very definitely need looking at $unc$one is foreign aid
i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us
right
i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget
again being just a voter and a taxpayer working through our congressman i dont think theres too much that im going to be able to do about it
but i believe in taking an active part in politics
so
yeah
i
$unc$one thing that really bothers me beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes
and the regular normal taxpayers are paying such a large proportion of our personal income
uh-huh
and then the corporate industries just dont seem to not pay proportionally
right
i think that that would help a lot
i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things
but i dont know its just hard to take and see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use
uh-huh
and seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction
but
yeah
they dont seem to
i really think the biggest problem
and then the $unc$taft-rudman $unc$act is supposed to help that
the biggest part is they have no accountability for what theyre doing
yeah
this nonsense thats coming through now about lowering payments on $unc$social $unc$security and a few other things that $unc$bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money its ridiculous
yeah
if they dont have that money now bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government
not going to help
its never helped my personal situation
i cant say it would help with theirs either
no
yeah
and thank $unc$god we dont operate our budget the way they operate theirs or wed all be in dire trouble
amen
but thats
yeah
i dont know what were going to be able to do about it
but i guess its sitting around so long that its sort of like our mortgages
i dont ever expect to pay mine off before i die
so i guess why should the government
isnt
thats the way theyre thinking these days anyway
it seems to be
i
it really does bother me when i think about leaving our children with this sort of a national problem that we cant seem to find an answer to it
i dont know
i dont think it ever will really
i
maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense
right
really
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic intergovernmental or inter $unc$united $unc$states like programs that one really might
yeah
i believe in paying my share
and i dont mind paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to
but i just sometimes feel like im being used
but again i dont think well be able to do anything about it
so
thats quite possible
i guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit
or it will just totally get even more out of control
but i dont know
yeah
bite the bullet

so youre little bit younger than i am
but yeah
i think if my $unc$seventeen year old my $unc$fourteen year old my other $unc$two children like it
im over $unc$forty
and i like it
i think its wonderful
yeah
its a good show
i like $unc$murphy $unc$brown and designing women too
yeah
we are so busy with all of our kids are in sports
and i hardly ever watch t v
but thats $unc$one that we watch
and then $unc$sunday nights we watch life goes on
yeah
i like that
thats a good show too
very good
did you see the $unc$one on $unc$sunday
yes
it was a
i did miss that $unc$sunday
no
i didnt
that $unc$one kid that $unc$becca likes he has aids
yeah
its a good episode
yeah
the new character on there did
right
right
all the way to $unc$north $unc$carolina
what time is it there
it is $unc$twenty minutes to $unc$nine
my gosh
im $unc$twenty minutes to $unc$six here
$unc$three hours difference
yeah
yeah
okay
what else do you like
lets see i like a lot of different shows
lets see i like murder she wrote
thats
i never watched that ever in my entire life
and $unc$matlock is another good one i watch
uh-huh
then during daytimes i like all my children
a small bowl will be plenty
thats mine
thats the only one i watch whenever i
a small bowl will be better because its pretty fattening
talk to my daughter
all my children
ive watched that for about $unc$twelve years
yeah
im sure i watched it for more than that probably
$unc$twenty something
i used to watch $unc$general hospital when i was a teenager because i
i quit watching $unc$general hospital when $unc$leslie got killed
oh
so that was a long time ago
i used to watch it in high school and college when lauras mother got killed
right
she was my favorite character on there
i just
i read the reason they killed her off was because they couldnt settle a contract
and i said if theyre going to do that to her i wont watch it
thats great
i do like all my children
and i like it i dont know
i just
i like the people on it i guess
i like it
i just wish theyd bring some of the old characters back
yeah
tads going to come back i bet do you think
yeah
im sure he will
hell come back show up at just the right moment
i kind of wish that $unc$nina would come back because the story
oh
just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with $unc$palmer remarrying and everything
yeah
$unc$daisy pops in once in a while
and i forgot about $unc$nina and $unc$cliff right
yeah
cliffs on the young and the restless now
he is
so hes out for good
yeah
hes out for good
did they marry
$unc$nina and $unc$cliff
thats how they left the show but not in real life
now shes married to some guy in $unc$new $unc$york
and shes happily married
and thats the reason she left the show
i guess she wanted a private life
okay
i watch it maybe twice a month
so i dont watch it everyday like i did when i had babies
i watch
because i play lots of tennis
and im gone a lot
so i dont get to watch
i watch it everyday religiously
i videotape it when i have to miss it
no kidding
yeah
i used to be like that
im that way about a lot of different shows
im that way about $unc$murphy $unc$brown designing women
dont they have a new chick on there instead of whats her name
yeah
theres $unc$two new characters on there
theres $unc$jan $unc$hooks from $unc$saturday night life
i dont know if you know her or not
huh-uh
thats a show i like
and then the blond headed girl that used to be on $unc$newhart
yeah
i dont like her on it
i never have liked her
so
i just know which one she is
i dont
shes taken suzannes part
and then $unc$jan $unc$hooks has taken charlenes part
$unc$charlene was $unc$delta $unc$burke
$unc$charlene was $unc$jean $unc$smart the blond headed
okay
i never watch that one either
i really dont watch a whole lot of t v just on $unc$sunday nights
life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner
and my whole familys home because i dont allow the kids out on $unc$sunday night because theyve got to go to bed and go to school the next day
yeah
and so we sit around and eat popcorn
and then we watch americas funniest home videos
those are always pretty cute
murder she wrote comes on opposite of that
and so
so you dont watch that one instead of
yeah
i pick nights pretty much so on t v that i watch different networks
but $unc$beverly $unc$hills $unc$nine $unc$oh $unc$two $unc$one $unc$oh i watch it religiously
sure
yeah
we like that real well
it
be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebodys getting killed on it
uh-huh
i know
the kids already know who it is
i dont know who it is though
who is it
ask them
let me ask $unc$nicole
$unc$nicole
what
do you want to start
you hit
it doesnt matter
were discussing the capital punishment i believe
right
you are right
yeah
i suppose i should have
which
i am $unc$pro capital punishment except that i dont like the way its done
uh-huh
yeah
i guess i hate to see anyone die
uh-huh
but i guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse i dont think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
i agree
im
capital
the
capital punishment is necessary in many cases
but the
its not a deterrent or our jails would not be so full
there wouldnt be so many people in $unc$death $unc$row
uh-huh
i think it needs to be something a throwback to where they did a public execution where its visible
yeah
something not gruesome
but something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people
if you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty
and it was going to happen to you
yeah
no stays of execution
no loopholes
no
and even that i dont really know if that would help
i think a lot of these people do it mainly because of t v
and a-
notoriety
the double reason they see it being done on t v and also the fact of notoriety
they become well known
they are almost like a big star
yes
but they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal
yeah
they know that they will probably be out in $unc$ten to $unc$twelve years
uh-huh
that they are going to write a book
they are going to go on talk shows
theyre goin-
thats a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life
yeah
right
in complete
of any notoriety
yeah
i think if they went according to the $unc$bible where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life
uh-huh
right
you take a life you give yours
right
thats for sure
theres exceptions to the rule
if its an accidental taking then you look at that
but most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure i dont like to see that
uh-huh
i guess also the fact that they say its not a deterrent
it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again
yes
they will
not if hes killed he cant do it again
it
thats correct
yes
if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed
the death penalty
uh-huh
yeah
but the chances are not great that that will happen
right
but theres a greater chance that hell be back out on the streets in $unc$twelve years
uh-huh
yeah
i guess im also looking at beyond even that
i guess i been thinking about it
and i dont have a definite opinion
but repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but beating them half to death
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
just for pleasure too
and i guess youve got to look at something like that
yes
do they deserve to remain on this earth too
you could carry it to that if they are a repeat offender
and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes
right
and of course of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime
you wouldnt be able to under our system
right
$unc$china and a few other countries have a little different view of that
you get caught with dope there and you die period
yeah
uh-huh
there is no appeals
there is no
i dont know what to do about the federal budget
there certainly have been ideas surfaced recently matter of fact repeatedly by many people
and i sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area
the first one is we need people in there that understand numbers the numbers that are being thrown around when were talking in trillions of dollars which is an astronomical sum
uh-huh
and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means
are you talking about the elected people
or are you talking about others
the elected people
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
our $unc$senate and $unc$congress and people that deal everyday and whats going to be done with those monies and dont really understand what that is or how a budget even works
yes
uh-huh
we need to elect people that are more
or
im not sure how you would ach-
how would you achieve that
if
lets make them have a degree in economics
so you would trust the decision making economists
sometimes called the dismal science
yeah
but people that understand the value of a dollar
uh-huh
yes
and wh-
in
the lobbyists needs them to be eliminated from $unc$congress
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
they dont make pragmatic decisions
they make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe
yes
uh-huh
or they tack on this pork bellies and do things that are good for their area to pass something that is not good for the country
right
you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists
right now lobbyists require to register youd just say make them all
i definitely would
yeah
get rid of them
totally
no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for
i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute
uh-huh
but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
uh-huh
thats a conflict of interest as far as im concerned
yeah
when you are talking again billions and trillions of dollars youre jeopardizing the future of the country for today
uh-huh
that
so you talk about jeopardizing the future
would you be against any deficit spending
i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation thats going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line
you cant ease into it
it took years and years to build up the momentum thats there now
uh-huh
i forget the figures on the interest rate
but its something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest
uh-huh
yeah
part of the problem is we dont loan from ourselves
we buy from intimate international banking
thats why we have interest
uh-huh
and i really feel that is part of the problem that weve let things get so out of control that we dont want to put the brakes on them
but what practical steps could one take
by having a budget that is reasonable
but everybody will say that he is for that
and how will you make that actually happen
of course
sure
and then add on to it
you take the gross national income and you say our budget is $unc$x number of percent of this gross national income
uh-huh
$unc$one thing we could do is give a $unc$ten percent income tax across-the-board
uh-huh
everyone no matter what pays a $unc$ten percent income tax
yep
sounds like a good idea
nothing escapes right
no deductions nothing
thats right
right
no deductions
just $unc$ten percent
you pay a $unc$ten percent income tax
yep
thats what you pay
if you make $unc$forty $unc$million dollars then youre going to pay $unc$four $unc$million
right
i-
if you make $unc$forty dollars youre going to pay $unc$four dollars
and thats it
yep
so thats it
thats
i agree with that
thats a good idea
and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what
i dont know that it would or wouldnt
whats your favorite baseball team $unc$rita
i suppose im supposed to say the $unc$rangers right
is that what i-
is the $unc$million dollar question here
that isnt a true false or right or wrong test here
yeah
i would to say the $unc$rangers
but unfortunately theyre not
i was from $unc$illinois
and my favorite team was the $unc$white $unc$sox
not a $unc$cubbies fan
no
no
my dad was
but i turned out to be a $unc$white $unc$sox fan
thats all right
i lived in $unc$chicago
how do you expect them to do this year
yeah
they did pretty well
okay
what did you think of the $unc$world $unc$series
ill tell you
i just moved down from $unc$south $unc$dakota in $unc$july
and in $unc$south $unc$dakota the $unc$minnesota $unc$twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living
uh-huh
and so everybody was a $unc$twins fan
and i didnt have much interest in the $unc$twins
it was kind of pathetic
we only had $unc$two radio stations
and $unc$one of them broadcast every $unc$twins game live
and the other one was country
so you didnt really have a lot of choice did you
so thats right
theres was $unc$twins there or $unc$skip $unc$williams
or country
yeah
and i was routing for the $unc$twins myself because a couple of $unc$ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here went to $unc$minnesota
and we used to tease my son
and i used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to $unc$minnesota
but it certainly was an exciting series anyway
it sure was
it sure was
what do you think going to happen to the $unc$rangers
i would like to assume that theyre going to do better this coming year
or can we predict
i was sure hopeful anyway
when we moved down i was able to go to my first baseball game and thought this is great this is incredible
uh-huh
so i became a $unc$rangers fan
i didnt really have $unc$one in $unc$south $unc$dakota
so i adopted the $unc$rangers
or rather they adopted me i guess
uh-huh
and it was just exciting
you can watch baseball on t v
and they hit the long ball
and it looks like wow they really hit that ball
but when you go to the ball park its really not all that far
no
and its so much more exciting watching a ball come at you
and
isnt it though
but i think going to the ball park just really makes it because then you watch it on t v you feel like youre more a part of it too
thats right
thats right
im a great sports enthusiast
so i love baseball teams
and they
in fact on the news tonight $unc$nolan $unc$ryan was on there
he was put in which i never knew existed the $unc$restaurant $unc$hall of $unc$fame
the $unc$restaurant $unc$ha-
the $unc$restaurant $unc$hall of $unc$fame inducted him tonight
and he says hes coming back
huh
he doesnt know how many years to pitch
right
hell be at least $unc$one more
and he said hes been saying $unc$one more and its been $unc$two and $unc$three might be $unc$two and $unc$three more
he likes it
thats right
yeah
and hes still doing great still doing excellent
thats right
and he said i get a kick out of it
hes such a nice man
didnt he just sign a $unc$twelve year contract with the $unc$rangers
yeah
and he
when he quits at being active he will go into managing and being a coach im sure
management
right
but he certainly is a good example for the kids
thats right
you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man he is
some of the
$unc$ivan $unc$rodriguez wasnt even born when $unc$nolan $unc$ryan started pitching
thats right
and its just incredible to think that there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against $unc$nolan or with $unc$nolan
uh-huh
and now their sons are
hes been a legend for so many years
and i dont know
had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at $unc$u $unc$t with his son
his son pitched for $unc$u $unc$t
and he pitched for an exhibition game for the $unc$rangers
uh-huh
i wasnt
yeah
it was a
i think it was a little early part of the summer
and $unc$nolan against
was it $unc$nolan against
$unc$ryan against $unc$ryan
$unc$ryan against $unc$ryan
yeah
his son pitched for $unc$u $unc$t
that is neat
and only ryan didnt want too much publicity on it because he didnt want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing
uh-huh
a game is a game
the $unc$rangers really knocked the socks off of them which you would expect anyway
right
but $unc$nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something of the game
so
how do you feel about capital punishment
i just last $unc$friday got off a capital murder case
you did
yeah
i was on the jury
wow
yeah
which is funny because i got called last night
and the topic was something about juries
really
yeah
so i am just hitting it right
how do i feel about it
i dont know
i guess it is right in certain cases
yeah
becau-
the $unc$one i was just on i dont
i was an alternate on the case
so i dont know what was decided
right
they are probably still in deliberations on it
uh-huh
but what i found out
once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed we met with the judge the $unc$two alternates did
right
and he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy
and i remember hearing about it
it was about a year ago
he was involved in another capital murder the very next month
and he was caught just
they drove up
the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy
wow
so he was caught
and its interesting because the county i live in
im not in $unc$dallas county
im pretty far north of $unc$dallas
okay
county i live in the past $unc$ten years only had $unc$two capital murders
wow
and last year there were $unc$six
and this guy is indicted on $unc$three of them
really
yeah
so you have to wonder
wow
yeah
the cases like that they should
yeah
if hes going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
yeah
although its not really revenge because it doesnt mean anything to him
he has no concept of what he has done
really
he just
from what i can tell i didnt talk to the guy or anything
but he doesnt seem to have any regard for anybodys life including his own
right
wow
so its kind of strange that
uh-huh
no remorse whatsoever
no
huh-uh
i guess in cases like where the guy would obviously go out and do it again youve got to do something
yeah
yeah
its funny because when they interview you before you go on the jury for capital murder i was interviewed by $unc$four attorneys for about $unc$five hours
right
wow
and i
the
i was i think the $unc$ninety eighth person theyd interviewed
youre kidding
but at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone
and do you think youd ever know beyond a doubt
and i said i cant imagine
i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah
i guess i could convict him
but i cant imagine you ever making me that sure of something
right
but they really did
it was really amazing
really
i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun
that was a subsequent case that we didnt know about and those jurors dont know about
really
but this particular case they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police hadnt released
okay
so no one else would have known
oh
it was really pretty interesting
wow
what
educational
i guess cases like that i dont see why they wouldnt bring in the new evidence from the other case
they can i think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasnt been found guilty of it
okay
of that crime
right
but he was found guilty of anoth-
okay
right
so its not going to take much to prove that
that works
right
so
they pushing the death penalty
yeah
this guy is up for the death penalty
wow
and in $unc$texas there is a couple of questions you have to ask in the punishment phase
for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation
and there is a number of questions
and just depending on whether you say yes or no you can give him capital punishment
and if youre up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances
okay
so
so there is a lot of outs
but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison
yeah
and im really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much
yeah
right
and to me you take away a persons freedom youve taken away most of their life
thats true
if youre going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole
yeah
but
but then you have to look at reality
i think normally they may get out
so
thats true
but what is it worth
i dont know
uh-huh
personally i dont know which i would pick if i had a choice for myself
thats true
i dont know whether id stay in prison or not
or
yeah
you said youre from $unc$mississippi
yes maam
and do they have the death penalty there
yes
they do
i
theyve had a number of cases here
uh-huh
not a whole lot
$unc$jackson i heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year
uh-huh
it was like last year they had $unc$forty-nine
so thats going up
uh-huh
but yeah
they have a death penalty
i hear of $unc$one every now and then
uh-huh
and i visited the prison up here at $unc$parchman
uh-huh
and ive been
i havent
they wont let you on death row
but theyll let you look down the hall
you cant see any prisoners
and its kind of a weird feeling
ive been
they took us around on a tour
and i got to walk in the gas chamber
ooh
and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing youre sitting there saying people have died here
thats right
but i guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
lets see
what type of car do i want
id like to have a $unc$corvette
wow
but my weekly wages dont apply for me to have that kind of car
so
yeah
im engaged to get married
so ill more likely get a car for economic reasons
right
yeah
so to drive back and forth to work is all ill need a car for pretty much
and we have a truck
so probably a economic size car or
what kind of a car do you have now
right now i have a $unc$eighty-seven $unc$cavalier
its a piece of
my car is really old too
because i drive out of town a lot of the weekends
uh-huh
and i would like my next car to have good gas mileage
right
and same here
a nice car $unc$american made
and a nice car but not too expensive
because i couldnt afford a brand new $unc$lamborghini
i hardly drive
but while were talking
right
while were talking my next car id like to be sporty and nice
right
but its expensive
and then insurance is really high for that too
so something thats not too sporty because of insurance then
i know
right
that insurance does come into play
i forgot about that
yeah
what kind of insurance do you have up there
or is it real high up there
no
mine just got lowered because i just turned $unc$twenty-one
and im not sure really how much i pay
i just
my moms helping me out because im in college
so i just give her the money and take her word for it
right
right
that insurance is high dollars
yeah
yeah
it is
so
but
and the more expensive the car the higher it is
so unless i win the lottery i wont be driving anything too expensive
right
yeah
right
i dont plan on buying a car for many many years
so
right
yeah
i have to make this $unc$one last as long as i can
whats everybody drive up there
in $unc$kenosha
in $unc$wisconsin they drive them little $unc$four wheelers or $unc$four wheel drive
it just is
or do you all need $unc$four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything
yeah
we have a $unc$jeep with $unc$four wheel drive because of the snow you mean
or
right
it never snows down here
so
we dont have any snow here now
really
it all melted
yeah
there is no snow at all
we havent had snow yet
we usually only get once a year or so
kind of strange to you all
yeah
yeah
it is
because how
its like $unc$seventy degrees here right now
dont tell me that
yep
how cold is it there
its been warm
its in the forties
really
yeah
and thats really warm
huh
and its supposed to rain tomorrow
so we
ive only seen snow once this year
and it was really bad
and then it all melted within the week
really
and now there is no snow
so
huh
but what is your dream car
i havent really thought about it
im not too big on cars
i dont know the names and stuff
but if i were to go to a car lot and look at them i would pick out $unc$one that looked really nice
uh-huh
whats your favorite color
for a car
yeah
probably blue if it was just an average middle class car
blue
but if i were to get a sports car maybe white or red
right
right
yeah
what kind of car do you drive right now
its a $unc$sky $unc$hawk $unc$buick
really
$unc$eighty-three
i think
really
yeah
like $unc$eighty-two $unc$thousand miles
really
yeah
oh
im afraid its not going to last me that long
and i hope it does though
yeah
its a $unc$two door
i like smaller cars
theyre
i find them more comfortable to drive
right
does everybody have their windows tinted up there
no
i dont see too many cars tinted
everybody has tinted down here
im sure
yeah
i could see why
you been down here before
yep
really
did you like it
it was busy
yeah
its different i bet
yeah
it was nice
i remember swimming on $unc$easter day
and it was really cold up here
but came back with a little tan
right
so that was nice
its
everybody freaks out when it sn-
hi
i guess
which $unc$one have you got right now
or
i
couple of them
i at the moment use an $unc$a $unc$s $unc$t $unc$two $unc$eighty-six
and i got a leading edge
and i got a $unc$american one and had a $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m one
but
my
just a couple
what do you have
ive got an $unc$omega
and ive got a generic or $unc$four $unc$eighty-six machine
yeah
yeah
its very very generic
what did you do put it together
yeah
and upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
and now its a fast machine
thats
yeah
thats all i got to say for it
yeah
what do you use it for
huh
what do you use it for
work
im a contract programmer
yeah
what kind of programs do you
anything
okay
business programs
or man
ive done business programming scientific applications like petroleum science stuff and test equipment
and i did $unc$one that was the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens
it was kind of fun
uh-huh
put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display and make it look like things like attack simulators and all sorts of little things youd want to put your finger on the screen for
huh
thats
that sounds interesting
matter of fact i guess you get a lot of graphics in there i imagine
yeah
definitely
thats where the speed helps out
yeah
unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a $unc$seven and a half megahertz $unc$eighty-six
its slow
yep
that will slow you up
huh
i do programming for $unc$c $unc$n $unc$c turret presses and cat cam system type things
uh-huh
and really need a faster system
i got a new line that i sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling $unc$et $unc$cetera
uh-huh
i know a guy that upgrades for a reasonable cost
who is that
his name is $unc$t $unc$q or something like that
and my notebook is somewhere around here
see if i can make my telephone cord stretch far enough
ive tried to do is get this outfit to give me $unc$one
hes up in
huh
thats how i got my other ones by selling their product for them
they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software
uh-huh
and as they go to the next one i just keep the
that works
thats why i have so many different levels of p c around at the moment
here it is
$unc$a $unc$t $unc$s $unc$computers
$unc$a $unc$t $unc$s
uh-huh
and where are they at
do you know where $unc$custer is
yeah
okay
hes south of $unc$renner on $unc$custer
and there is a little bitty mall strip kind of center
in $unc$richardson there
in $unc$richardson
uh-huh
i know where you mean
there is a $unc$mobil and all that kind of s- on that $unc$one corner
thats about $unc$lookout there i think isnt it
right
its just south of there
yeah
its a little place looks like a castle
yeah
kind of little guy in there
he gives reasonable prices
oh
i traded my $unc$three $unc$eighty-six for the $unc$four $unc$eighty-six for about $unc$six $unc$hundred
really
thats a good deal
yeah
it was pretty reasonable
yeah
but he
and he does a good job
and he guarantees everything he sells
there is a lot
you ever go by $unc$lucky $unc$computer there
uh-huh
yeah
i used to
when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys id go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems
uh-huh
havent been doing much of that for the last year or so
so i dont know where those guys are at these days
but i
theyre up there in that mall just below $unc$campbell or that strip center
yeah
yeah
theyre still doing business big business apparently
i tell you those prices have just unbelievably come down
uh-huh
yeah
i was amazed i was able to get this $unc$four $unc$eighty-six for $unc$six $unc$hundred even with a trade in
its like wow
yeah
that works
ill go do that
i
and boy that thing screams now
yeah
i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the $unc$three $unc$eighty-six
that wasnt alive for but maybe $unc$two years
uh-huh
i thought was funny that they kept pushing the $unc$three $unc$eighty-six $unc$s $unc$x even though the price difference is about $unc$ten dollars
is that right
thats it
yeah
when it comes on the manufacturing floor its about $unc$ten bucks
ill be darned
yeah
youve done
our most recent series of projects i guess inside was we remodeled a bathroom recently
how did it go
it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which $unc$one thing led to another
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over
like starting over i guess
it wasnt $unc$one of those
it started out as a $unc$sunday project
uh-huh
and by the next $unc$sunday it was done
it wasnt a $unc$one dayer
believe me
boy that sounds like
course i dont know
once you get it done then you probably wont have that problem again
yeah
its good for another $unc$thirty years
youve got an older house
yes
they are built a little bit more sturdy than
thats the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper
right
and it was all soldered
is that right
thats what drove me bananas because im going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and cement to fit them together
yes
and nothing wanted to go
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
and just start at square $unc$one
really
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
and then if you do it wrong
i was very fortunate in the fact that when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
everything went all right
everything worked
and i just said thats marvelous
i appreciate it
thats the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens
i expected something to leak left a fitting loose or didnt use teflon tape on $unc$one of them or something like that
right
yes
right
but it all came together
so i felt pretty fortunate about that
all worked out all right
how about you
probably the last thing i did was paint and wallpaper kids room
uh-huh
and i learned to
i used the wrong kind of paint
this must have not been a very good quality because it just hasnt stood up very well
what kind of paint
it was a latex paint
it was flat
uh-huh
and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss
but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
yeah
that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls
yeah
but i think maybe
i dont know if it was just the
was it not washable paint
it is a latex paint
but it just kind of is
so youre supposed to be able to wash it
uh-huh
but it just looks dingy
i dont know how else to explain it
what color is it
its pink
pink
okay
its kind of got just kind of a worn look to it
i dont know even how to say
just didnt turn out quite as nice as i would have liked
but
did you require more than $unc$one can of paint
we put $unc$two coats on it
and its a small room
but i think it only took $unc$one can
you didnt have to mix paint then right
no
okay
we did
you do mix the color as far as you start with white
and then they add the color
uh-huh
yeah
you know what im saying
but
yeah
but you only had $unc$one can of paint that you did the entire room with
yes
right
and then i wall papered a couple of walls
and
howd that go
that was the first time ive ever wallpapered
and
kind of fun isnt it
thats an education in itself
really
but the dye lots must have been a little bit different from
first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if youre trying to match a design
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you buy your paper
yes
thats what i needed
and i didnt think about that
i got a $unc$mickey $unc$mouse print is what i got
yeah
and so a lot is wasted
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats
so you know how
i didnt even think to look for that
yeah
and then the
$unc$one of them was just a different color pink is what it ended up being
and
when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall
no
i didnt
or did you start at the edge
is that how youre supposed to do
i started at $unc$one edge and went over
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
uh-huh
uh-huh
but
ive had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall
and ill start with a plumb line and start in the middle of the wall and go from there and go all the way around the room
and start right there
do you seem to get it straighter
is that the advantage
or whats the
you
do you have any children
yeah
i have $unc$two boys $unc$twelve and $unc$sixteen
$unc$twelve and $unc$sixteen
uh-huh
how about you
i have $unc$three
and theyre $unc$five and $unc$three and $unc$nineteen months
oh
so we kind of got different ball game
but
right
what
do you feel like you have any time to spend with them
theyre probably at an age where they dont want to spend any time with their parents
thats true
you of course spend less time with them when they get older
but its of course still really important
right
i have a kind of a fortunate situation i think right now with my $unc$sixteen year old
i work $unc$two nights a week at a
im a librarian
uh-huh
and i work $unc$two nights a week at the $unc$senior $unc$high $unc$school library
they keep it open for kids to do their work
right
and then the school district hires an aide to work for me
sure
my son is my aide
thats nice
so $unc$two nights a week for $unc$four hours were stuck together
youre stuck together
and theres usually not very much business
no
some nights its just real quiet
so
i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part
so i have sort of a captive audience
so i really do spend probably more time with him than most
right
but of course im away from my other son those hours too
but his dads at home pretty much that time
and so that kind of gives him time with his dad then
yeah
thats true
yeah
gives him a little bit of that individual time
but it is hard once they get that age
their friends are the most important thing there is
right
and they want to be able to spend
thats right
ive even noticed that with my $unc$five year old she started kindergarten this year
and every day that shes not at school she thinks we need to have someone over and play
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that kind of
yeah
its kind of hard
yeah
its hard
i think i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should
yeah
im more worried about
i didnt this done
i didnt get
the kitchen needs to be cleaned
uh-huh
this needs to be done
and i need to remind myself to slow down
uh-huh
and itll still be there tomorrow
right
yeah
thats true
but thats kind of hard to do
yes
it is hard to do
right
yeah
you dont see yourself getting
if youre kind of a person that likes things organized or neat
uh-huh
or
right
then i think it is hard
its
i think $unc$one of the nice things about holidays is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family
slow down a little bit
we often go to $unc$illinois for $unc$christmas
uh-huh
and were not this year
and its just really nice because we can do the things you want to do
you can do more than when you travel
yeah
yeah
thats right
this is the first year were staying home too
and i think its going to be real quiet
but thats an opportunity to get out the games
and
yeah
right
we usually do that
my kids even have already gotten out
my $unc$twelve year old got out the $unc$legos which of course he hasnt touched since last summer
right
of course
but every now and then hes got a lot of those hard kind
and he wants to be an engineer
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
yeah
and we have the train
and we havent had that $unc$lego train together for years
so he sat down
and i told him i really wanted him to build the train
and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together
i wouldnt take it apart
wouldnt take it apart after that
yeah
and every year id have the $unc$lego train under the tree
thatd be kind of fun
so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on $unc$friday
and then his $unc$sixteen year old brother started helping too
these are kind of things during the normal rat race
right
right
those kinds of things never happen
no
but
no
in fact i think if people would learn to turn off the t v
and
uh-huh
yeah
i think thats a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family
yes
yeah
which is
usually people are not sitting in front of that
uh-huh
and theres always a few people in the family that when they stare at it theyre totally turned off to everything else
the rest of
yes
and you cant communicate while youre doing that right
no
thats right
whereas im the type of person i could not sit
i shouldnt say i could not
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something
yeah
yeah
me too
yeah
because they talk so much
isnt that the
they talk about t v shows
and i
how can you watch that
youre kind of like what are you talking about
and
its the best show on
i dont know
you feel like youre a little bit out of it dont you
they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us whats
okay
all set then
what do you think about it
i think its a real good concept
drug testing procedures would have to be refined
uh-huh
from what ive seen on the news theres a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in drug testing
i didnt realize that
yeah
there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their test
but they didnt know for sure what it was
but it was a drug
so they got turned down
and turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody elses blood test
uh-huh
same sort of problem that happens sometimes is some of these aids tests and such
okay
uh-huh
yeah
thats right
i have heard
i dont remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs
but there werent really any there
yeah
every now and then theres an error
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
yeah
yeah
i work here at $unc$texas $unc$instruments
so let me think do we everyone coming in
i guess i did $unc$three years ago
yeah
everyone coming in goes through the drug testing procedure
and they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions
uh-huh
so if they test for drugs
yeah
i cant even remember if we do random sampling anymore
i know we did in the military
but i dont know if once your in they continue to do it
yeah
but i guess youre always on call for it
yeah
i not very long ago worked for $unc$wal-mart
uh-huh
and about a year and a half ago they instituted a drug and alcohol testing program
its not a random
uh-huh
through the s-
it
as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a blood test
uh-huh
but i think the big problem though is they send these off to large labs
b-
uh-huh
right
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up things like that
so your big beef with it is the
its
its a good idea
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better
yeah
make sure its a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever
yeah
i tend to agree with you $unc$david
yeah
yeah
my brother used to work for $unc$wal-mart
and then i dont know if he still does or what because i dont know if sams is actually part of it
but he is working at sams now
yeah
yeah
sams is part of $unc$wal-mart
okay
yeah
then hes been working for the company for a while too
he
yeah
good company
yeah
you all have some
hes telling me about good profit sharing and all that
companys that was a great place to work
so
uh-huh
its good news
yeah
they had $unc$two or $unc$three years in with them you can start buying stock
and you have a little taken out of your check each payday to put not portfolio just against $unc$wal-mart stock
uh-huh
uh-huh
but you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while
yeah
thats what my brother was telling me
thats good deal
how long were we s-
i havent done this in a couple months
how long were we supposed to discuss for
youre supposed to get $unc$five minutes
okay
we got a couple more minutes then i guess
think what else i can say about that
do you have any idea
lets see
you were tested for drugs as you got into $unc$t $unc$i
right
everyone coming in goes through the drug test
yeah
were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
or
no
let me think about that
yeah
it was after i had already been hired
okay
yeah
you get hired then you come in the first
i
seems to me i remember that i was hired came in and went through some orientation
and i thought i
i cant remember
that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test
maybe it was during the interview
i came up a couple times for an interview
so its hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened
but i guess just like other companies other friends ive been hearing about that have been moving around
its before
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment
so im sure that happened to me too
yeah
yeah
what about
they just instituted it there at $unc$wal-mart
yeah
so
it was after i was already working there
and they werent testing any of those who were already working
right
so
okay
you heard the question
what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs
uh-huh
ill tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now
okay
i do the easy stuff now
i change oil
and then what some people would consider a little more difficult ill change spark plugs
and ill change points and do air filters that kind of stuff
but i cant do as much as i used to
i used to do a whole lot more but not any more
theyre just too weird to work on now
is that the reason youre not doing it
or are you so busy you dont have time to do it
thats part of it
yeah
part of it is like you said i dont have time
okay
being a female and being alone i dont do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even
uh-huh
but have you had any major repairs recently
on this car ive got now no
but i had a van before
and it was only $unc$two years old
and it had transmission go out on it
oh
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty
okay
you should feel very fortunate
i had to have a transmission replaced in an $unc$eighty-six automobile
and ill declare thats an expensive
yeah
yes
uh-huh
maybe i should have just traded the car in
yeah
sometimes it makes you wonder
it just
i have a very comfortable car and i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i have a new transmission
and im sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount
but
yeah
it hurts real bad
did you take it to a dealership
no
i took it to an independent out in $unc$garland
uh-huh
i see
i had
these people were recommended by a neighbor
uh-huh
and thats the only thing
i am not a native of $unc$dallas
i see
so that means i have to depend on trustworthy friends
right
and thats
its fixed
its running
and i pray that i get my $unc$thirteen $unc$hundred dollars out of it
gosh
uh-huh
its going to run for a while yet
i know it
it certainly is frightening
what work are you in
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
oh
i work in the networking area
okay
okay
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
no
okay
no
i have just retired from the $unc$southwest $unc$medical $unc$center
oh
where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car
but theyre all too busy
so
yeah
i have to do it the other way
and thats find someone and pay them to do it
yeah
yeah
so i certainly hope you have a nice $unc$new $unc$year
yeah
im planning on it
it cant be any worse than last year
thats for sure
it could be
but i dont much think so
yeah
thats true
thats true
were starting out a new one
so lets make it a good one
yeah
im going to try and plan on it
okay
i enjoyed the conversation
thank you
thank you
bye
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what
do you watch much t v
or
no
i dont watch much t v
usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news
the news
yeah
but i dont think of that every day even
uh-huh
i think i get most of my current events
i get them from everywhere
i sometimes watch t v if i
i guess i watch t v if i havent read the paper that day
we dont get a paper
but i work at a
i teach a college class
and
uh-huh
theres a
the library has a paper
and so i often drop in on a break and read it
yeah
and i keep the radio on quite a bit when im home
uh-huh
and then i figure if theres big news ill hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else
yeah
yeah
i also
i get it from all over
i watch the news every day
and we have a news
we get the newspaper and magazines anything
uh-huh
im
i read a lot
so i get
im really up on current affairs
i get the news and everything
uh-huh
yeah
whats your favorite news
do you get a news magazine
or
im not getting an-
no
im not getting any news magazines
uh-huh
but as i said i do
its easy to keep up on current event- especially when you get a paper every day
yeah
yeah
weve got
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
exactly
and
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage
i dont know
is there anything missing
i
yeah
its kind of hard to know
and i dont know what are we supposed to compare it to the quality
uh-huh
whatever they tell you
i guess im satisfied
i
theyre supposedly covering everything that happens
so
yeah
yeah
i do feel a little bit like
being from $unc$california and wanting to hear
ive heard through the grapevine sometimes that theres been an earthquake or sliding or something
and
really
i dont ever hear it in the news here
oh
sometimes its such a
the tremors are so slight that they dont even bother putting it in the paper
yeah
yeah
but most of the times i find that even if they do have tremors out there therell be a small article in the paper about it
yeah
but
yeah
yeah
i sometimes feel like the $unc$dallas paper and the $unc$dallas $unc$news the top headlines are always a murder
thats what sells papers
thats because theres a high crime rate
yeah
yeah
thats been like that since the first newspaper
yeah
yeah
im sure
but i dont know
i guess im satisfied
i dont
uh-huh
what basis of comparison do we have really
yeah
really
we dont get a
thats true
we certainly get enough coverage
we can get news
theres even the $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n channel where we can get world news $unc$twenty-four hours a day
yeah
i was going to
sure
yeah
sometimes you dont even want to be bothered with the news because its all so bad
yeah
its all so negative
yeah
often times
but
so yeah
we have to keep talking i guess
no
i guess we can end
oh
yeah
its just whenever were
is it really
yeah
have you always gone until the recording
yeah
i dont
uh-huh
i guess were not supposed to
i dont know
i guess were supposed to wait
or i dont know
yeah
uh-huh
i
$unc$one
was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening
uh-huh
and it was really funny
i mixed it made the call
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away
really
yeah
and it was really
we were laughing
but we dont really do any gardening
so that took like a minute
uh-huh
and then we just talked about whatever
uh-huh
interesting
yeah
some topics
really now this topic this is
there really isnt much to say after you tell the person where they find their sources of information from
uh-huh
yeah
and then if theyre satisfied
and thats about it really
uh-huh
its hard to talk for $unc$five minutes on this
yeah
yeah
i guess i can just say it bothers me that i hear a lot on the news that
it seems like i dont know some things are sensationalized or some things are
youll hear $unc$one report
and then youll hear that they didnt
okay
what are your favorite shows
i like watching $unc$colombo and $unc$matlock and quantum leap
really
yeah
quantum leap
uh-huh
did you see it the other night
uh-huh
that was pretty good
yeah
that one was
what about
what do you
with the psychic and everything
uh-huh
yeah
okay
yeah
i like northern exposure and home improvement
i havent seen either of those
youve never seen northern exposure
huh-uh
its a great show
i also like to watch star trek
but its on so late here that i dont always get to see it
really
yeah
we like it too
have you seen the movie
i havent seen any of the movies because i just in the last year or so got interested in it
and theyre already out with number $unc$six by now
so i havent seen any of the movies yet
but i
you havent seen any of them
no
theyre good
theyre real good
theyre getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
uh-huh
which ones are you watching the new ones
yeah
ive seen quite a few of the older ones
i havent seen really the new generation that much
okay
yeah
is there $unc$one you prefer better the older one or the newer one
theyre a lot different
but i like the older ones because at that time they were really futuristic
yeah
and i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too
but i like both of them
yeah
i do too
i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot
he almost hates the new ones
really
yeah
because he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isnt or something
but i dont
no
not really
its not really like a soap opera
i think
yeah
but its
but thats true
you learn more about the characters and stuff
but thats the way all shows are now
yeah
sure
lets see
i like to watch $unc$colombo because its like a mystery thing
yeah
thats sort of how matlock is
but $unc$colombo is way tricky
yeah
he doesnt even try to let the person know hes getting onto them
it seems like they always show $unc$colombo the same ones over and over though you know what im saying like that $unc$one where he goes to college
did you see the $unc$one
or is there a series on
yeah
theres $unc$one on
we see it $unc$thursdays at $unc$seven
and it was
okay
this last time it was about this movie director
did you hap-
yeah
i saw that $unc$one
did you see that
that was a rerun
really
i guess i nev-
yeah
i wondered if thats
i dont know if thats the movie of the week or what
but it seems like theres only about $unc$four or $unc$five different ones
and then they keep showing them over and over
i guess i havent seen it before
he was a movie director
and he had that gal killed
yeah
okay
yeah
on the set or something
that was pretty good though
yeah
it was
but yeah
i like $unc$colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things
uh-huh
but theres never anything good on $unc$saturdays though
no kidding
i dont think so
star treks on at $unc$five
but im never home
so
what is it that
theres something i watch on $unc$saturdays
and i cant remember what it is
i used to watch twin peaks
oh
you never saw that
ive heard of it a lot
ive heard of
a lot of people somehow or something
theyll say so and so from twin peaks or something
yeah
yeah
that was a different soap opera
oh
but it was a different type of show
uh-huh
i didnt like the way it ended though
did they end the whole series
yeah
oh
yeah
they only did it for i think $unc$two years
oh
but its all over now
another show i like to watch is mash
hi $unc$cynthia
what did you wear to work today
lets see
what did i wear to work today
i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse and flat shoes
so can you dress pretty casually
on occasion
yeah
i do vary
i wear suits
i wear skirts and sweaters
on occasion i can wear jeans
how about you
i run a business out of my home
uh-huh
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats do whatever i want to do with the kids then whenever i have a meeting with a client ill put a suit on and then come home and get back into regular clothes again
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
theres no real dress code where i work
you see people wearing all different attire
i dont like to wear heels that really tires me out
i work in a big building
yeah
so i predominantly wear flat shoes
in the winter i wear sweaters
in summer i like $unc$one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
ive recently tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot
right
right
thats helped me a lot with having
i can only have a limited wardrobe since im only working part-time right now
uh-huh
uh-huh
but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that
uh-huh
right
right
accessories
uh-huh
what about your casual wear
do you like to wear jeans most of the time
yeah
mostly
at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also
yeah
its nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when its so hot
yeah
theyre like $unc$ber-
dress shorts
yeah
theyre like black corduroy $unc$bermuda shorts
yeah
and sometimes i wear a blazer with them
and i get really a lot of compliments on them
where i work is predominantly male
yeah
so they
their attire is always the same suits or slacks jeans whatever
yeah
but
but im really the only woman i guess at work that does that
but seems to work for me
yeah
but
in fact i just got a new outfit as a gift that
its $unc$one of those skorts
th-
its shorts but it looks like a skirt
uh-huh
so i think thatll be good for work too
yeah
itll be comfortable
yeah
yeah
so
i guess down here
we just recently moved to $unc$texas
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit
uh-huh
we moved from $unc$colorado where
and i have a closet full of sweaters
uh-huh
that
i live in $unc$virginia
you live in $unc$virginia now
uh-huh
thats interesting
yeah
yeah
so im
right now today was in about the fifties
uh-huh
but i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses
yeah
id like to be able to wear those here
today its $unc$eighty-eight degrees
my
uh-huh
needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
uh-huh
today was definitely a shorts day around here
uh-huh
yeah
were still pretty much in winter as far as that goes here
this is pretty unseasonal
but at least we
it feels good
it gets
everybody doesnt have cabin fever today
its nice to get out and about
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess weve discussed everything there is about clothing
okay
sounds good
okay
it was nice talking to you
okay
it was nice talking to you also
bye-bye
bye-bye
hi
hi
okay
particularly what kind of music do you like
i mostly listen to popular music
i listen to it all the time in my car
so i tend to be $unc$one of those people who switches stations a lot because i dont like commercials
but i find myself listening to popular music
yeah
and quite honestly i have some little children
and i unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately
but thats not by my choice
really
how about you
i dont have that experience to share
lucky you
i do listen to a lot of
i switch the stations a lot because i dont have a cassette player in my car
uh-huh
however i do like a lot of different forms of music
so i switch quite often
i think i like
im really particular about the type of music that i listen to
uh-huh
but the
theres such a wide selection
i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music
i like music that i feel
if it is performed correctly or if its done right or if the version is done right i like it
yeah
but if its not then i wont
i really dont
how do you feel about rap music
rap
it seems to be so popular these days
yeah
i dont really have anything against rap music
i
the $unc$one thing i do object to about rap music is when it becomes militant or if its violence oriented
uh-huh
right
i have strong objections to that
i listen to
$unc$one time i remember this was back i would say about $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen years ago i
when it was really just starting
yeah
right
when it was just starting i heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it was about
the piece of music was i think about $unc$forty or $unc$fifty years old
and it was incredible the parallel between it and rap
right
and you listen a lot
if you hear a lot of old gospel especially the black gospel
you can really pick it up
yeah
you really
it seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music
a lot of times youll hear songs that theyre not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm
yeah
and it sounds so much different
and yet i have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music
and she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that shes listening to
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
yeah
yeah
they do cover versions of standards i guess you could call it
thats right
i think its kind of absurd the fact that they dont really give the original artist or the original composer the credit that is really due to them
no
yeah
i guess there was even a bit of ruckus caused by the $unc$m $unc$c $unc$hammer whos really
yeah
seems to be the hot one of today
he used wild thing
do you remember that song
yeah
he used
i cant remember who the artist was on that
$unc$jimi $unc$hendrix was the original
who
$unc$jimi $unc$hendrix was the original
he wrote
was it
maybe it wasnt that $unc$one
because it was a living person that im thinking of that said you know hey those are my words
okay
and i guess that they hadnt originally gotten permission from him to use it
uh-huh
and he since then has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the song goes on
but
yeah
i dont know
it may have been somebody else because i think that even $unc$jimi $unc$hendrix did it
i think that was a cov-
come to think of it i think that was a cover version of a $unc$john $unc$lee $unc$hooker song or something
maybe so
i cant think
it was just like
it was really old
i
there are so many different songs
the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times ive heard some songs that i just thought were horrendous cover versions of
im like i dont want to listen to this because you think of the original is
yeah
that was really great
that was a really good piece of work
and then when you hear the cover its like god what are they doing
right
they destroyed it
i think a good one was
there was a $unc$peter $unc$frampton song
yeah!
and then the cover version i thought it was pitiful
i remember seeing the video of it on $unc$m $unc$t $unc$v
and i thought it was hideous
yeah
i did too
it was
ugh i didnt like that either
yeah
but whatever became of $unc$peter $unc$frampton
there was nothing
he was a phenomenon
there was no reason for him to really come into great stardom or anything
i remember i saw him in a concert when i was
yeah
yeah
i think it
i think it was in high school
yeah
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
uh-huh
he was very good
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in $unc$philadelphia
it was in $unc$j $unc$f $unc$k $unc$stadium if i can remember
man
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like
yeah
i graduated back in $unc$seventy-nine
so
uh-huh
but ive really
i loved
i was really into the album oriented music even then
uh-huh
so i was really familiar with a lot of the a o r type music
the album oriented like $unc$james $unc$taylor and the $unc$beatles
yeah
and a lot of people they go theyre better than the $unc$beatles
and im like you dont know what youre talking about
no
the comparison made between $unc$new $unc$kids on the $unc$block with the $unc$beatles it was just
you can only laugh
yeah
you just sort of
i guess i can just humor them at this point
right
they
i guess our age is showing when we think that
yeah
but ive liked a lot of the new music
i think when
uh-huh
i saw some promise with a lot of the new wave when it came out back in the mid and early eighties
yeah
and then i dont know
its in a very weird position right now
i think that
i like to hear what they call world music which is using all these natural forms of music
and
like $unc$paul $unc$simon
like
yeah
yeah
$unc$paul $unc$simon
yeah
really thats not world music
but what $unc$paul simons doing i think is great because hes using i guess what they call it is eclectic drawing from a lot of different sources and making a synthesis of a new type of music
yeah
what do you mean by world music
world music is
a lot of where they make music that they adapt to another type of listener
uh-huh
for example lets say youre taking an original brazilian form of music with a certain style
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for lets say another audience lets say a $unc$north $unc$american
uh-huh
and then when they hear it its another form of music and sort of trying to draw out the best sources
the best of every type of music
right
because there are some
i li-
there are some types of heavy metal that i really like
but i wouldnt say that i completely like heavy metal
no
i think
and its the same way with
world music takes the forms that have really been
the cream of the crop i guess you could say
and then taking those qualities and then applying in the styles that are extremely enjoyable and then taking
so then it becomes a kind of music of its own so to speak
or
yeah
yeah
it becomes a kind of music of its own
when you listen to it its
i think that they dont use elec-
some of it
its
they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
uh-huh
so a lot of the stuff you hear coming from $unc$south $unc$africa now and from $unc$west $unc$africa thats considered world music because its not particularly using certain types of folk styles
right
but theyre trying to make it somewhat more modern
i
another good example was i heard $unc$miles $unc$davis
and $unc$miles $unc$davis worked with $unc$robbie $unc$shoncar if you can believe it
uh-huh
uh-huh
hes a jazz performer
and then hes playing with $unc$robbie $unc$shoncar
hes a very good arranger
arrangement to
were going to have to get off
the
are they trying to
i dont know
but
weve talked our $unc$five minutes though
yeah
okay
but when i heard his album i heard it and it was just incredible
ive been listening to that a lot lately
yeah
i listened
and i heard
you hear this guitar
and then you hear the muted trumpet
i
me
and you never would think that they can actually play together
but
yeah
okay
i dont know
which end do we push
but okay
okay
lets see
i think theres a lot of people that dont vote because they dont really think their opinion is going to be heard
and theres such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the $unc$united $unc$states
and that
their votes not going to make that much difference
and whether you vote for $unc$one person or the other person the issues is what you believe in
and that person is going to have a lot of
since theres so many issues this $unc$one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them
right
yeah
so it would be really difficult to have that $unc$one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed
thats true
a lot of people
i think that it ends up the people that vote every time elections come around are more the party type followers the guys that follow the party lines
and they just go in
yeah
and if theyre $unc$republican they vote $unc$republican every year
and the people that are independent are the ones that dont really show up every year because they cant seem to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
right
yeah
yeah
thats good
ye-
i always thought
back when $unc$anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and hed actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes
but that didnt work
yeah
yeah
theres a lot of extremes on the parties too with the real far side of the $unc$democrats
theyre real liberal now to where probably $unc$fifty or a $unc$hundred years ago the $unc$democrat party being liberal like they are now would never be thought of
it would be the other way that the $unc$republicans were real liberal minded as far as moral standings and those kinds of things
uh-huh
but
yeah
yeah
thats
and then people always get upset about it too because every year the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote
uh-huh
they each think that if more people vote theyll get more votes
yeah
im always amazed that each candidate thinks its going to be the people that come out that will vote for him
yeah
thats true
i think in the $unc$texas governor elections i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
yeah
that
i know that theres certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately $unc$catholic type area
really
and when things start
when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired
right
and still on the other hand were also
this particular community is a $unc$catholic community
but down in $unc$d $unc$c where things are a little bit different its womens rights and that sort of movement
and so its quite the opposite
so elections start getting very
the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones
yeah
thats true
but
yeah
thats true that the different places in $unc$america that different issues would be a lot more important than in another place
yeah
i can understand why some of the rural areas the voter turnout isnt as much because it does seem sometimes the lobbyists in $unc$d $unc$c are controlling things for the $unc$midwest
uh-huh
and it doesnt matter who they put in office theyre going to fall subject to the pressure that the lobbyists can put
right
yeah
and its real true that theyll say $unc$one thing to get elected
and then once they do get elected they dont have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised beforehand
right
maybe it just wasnt possible at all in the first place like the no new taxes thing
thats
with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do
yeah
yeah
i dont think hes going to have to worry about that next year
i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected
right
right
after the war
uh-huh
that really
unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown even more because more $unc$democrats will think that they dont have a shot
so they wont even bother turning out
thats true
yeah
theyll just say the $unc$republicans have this election
well see you in $unc$four years
right
yeah
hope some of the local
thats what they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that arent turning out at the booths
they say that these older voters that they feel like the kids are running the country
so they dont turn out to vote
and theyre the ones that really know whats going on have the experience and seen how politicians can screwup or what ever
uh-huh
but i know my grandmother hasnt voted in years
right
thats
neither has mine as a matter of fact
and thats true
i think they look at it as everybody the majority of the people think this way when thats not necessarily true because thats what the media says
the majority believes this way
so they dont even bother turning out to vote to express their opinions
so thats true
yeah
wonder if theyre going to take into account this computerized conversation that theres little children bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking
yeah
do you hear the dogs in the background here
no
i cant hear them
okay
theyre
the children next door just opened the fence
and they went off
yeah
yeah
but thats
i guess weve talked long enough
and that was sort of interesting
yeah
what part of the country are you from
$unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
are you really
uh-huh
wow
this is
im from
this is $unc$dallas where im at
okay
the outskirts of $unc$dallas
i figured with $unc$texas $unc$instruments theyd probably have a few $unc$texans on the line now and then
yeah
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i in any way
no
huh-uh
wow
how did they get you
they went through engineering companies
oh
and were communications
i work in a communications company
okay
right
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
so we saw it on the $unc$t $unc$news $unc$one day
and i thought that might be interesting
yeah
sort of different
yeah
they called me at $unc$ten oclock $unc$one night
that was very strange
yeah
i guess they were doing $unc$eastern $unc$standard time
i was like
i dont know how long it takes whether it takes $unc$five minutes or $unc$twenty minutes
yeah
$unc$central $unc$standard time is what theyre doing it by
yeah
yeah
i still havent figured out which day is which yet
but i didnt study it that hard
so maybe ill figure it out
uh-huh
but it was nice to talk to you and sort of meet you
and that was an interesting topic
okay
yeah
okay
if your ever in $unc$d $unc$c come look up $unc$wayne $unc$sherman youll say yeah talked to that guy
okay
im $unc$kyle $unc$hunt too if you ever come to $unc$dallas area
oh
okay
we live right by the airport
yeah
yeah
so do we
okay
yeah
right next to $unc$dulles
yeah
ill talk to you later
okay
bye-bye
bye
back by that
the
there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of how women have changed
uh-huh
look at them
in $unc$england $unc$margaret $unc$thatcher was prime minister $unc$indira $unc$ghandi in $unc$india
uh-huh
so many women are heads of state
and we keep saying yes we feel some day a woman will be president
but i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that
i think well have a black president before we have a women president
uh-huh
and i dont know whether thats bad or good
its just a point that i have observed that we
yeah
i
yeah
i truly believe that before that we have to address the racial issues in the $unc$united $unc$states before we can go anywhere
yes
right
because its
oh
hello
i think were supposed to hang up
yeah
it wasnt the matter of wealth
it was the matter that they were not wealthy that made them equal
yes
ill talk to you later
all right
thank you
bye bye
okay
bye-bye
okay
what do you think about the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
i think that really it wouldnt hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service
and there have been so many people that have done it
and ive talked with several
and i think theyve gotten a lot out of it
are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
not right now
but i have done $unc$red $unc$cross work
and ive taught c p r training
a-
what about when would people do it when they finished high school
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times if they go straight into college i think theyre going in too quick
but
i think particular boys that the maturity
in fact i wasnt very mature when i left high school
and i think theres a real challenge there
theres also this issue of whether youre really ready
and i think it gives a different perspective
right
y-
i think if youve been out of school a year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more than someone that just goes right straight into college
the only complication is how do you fund something like this
a lot of parents fund their children
there are some groups that have their children go away for a year
even the religious organizations
yeah
i think the $unc$mormon church sends out missionaries that
right
and the parents fund them for the whole year and a half that theyre gone
its interesting
it gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful
although the kids today though it seems almost that their concern for money
we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious
as to if
if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary
do you think that would be reasonable
i think it would
in $unc$israel even the women are required to be in the military for a certain period of time
i was in the military
and i personally feel if they have the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men
but the issue of which
what would you have them do
there are a lot of people around with
theres a lot of unemployment right now
what would you have these people do if they were brought in
what into the service
yeah
or
or say the volunteer
say that it was mandatory
i think that they ought to have something for the unemployed in a voluntary field like the
i dont know if you remember about the $unc$w $unc$p $unc$a
yes
my father was in the $unc$c $unc$c $unc$c
he was in that
its not the best thing in the world
but it gave them something to do
it seems that theres some things like the programs at least just go around and clean up streets and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
r-
or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses
yeah
in fact we helped with $unc$help to $unc$help $unc$humanities
and that was a good experience
but you take the kids out
and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that either need demolishing or need fixing up
so
uh-huh
it would be a good idea
weve been doing this $unc$three or $unc$four minutes
i think that
do you have any other further comments
no
not really
it was good talking to you $unc$betty
o-
okay
ill talk to you later
have a good night
bye
books
yes
mainly i read the $unc$bible these days
thats very good
i do too
good thats great to hear
and christian literature
uh-huh
ive kind of
i used to read a lot of novels
but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the $unc$bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading
uh-huh
yeah
it does
it
and i been praying that $unc$god would put a desire to read the $unc$bible in my heart
and he really has
its getting to where a just really want to read it
thats good
thats good
its hard for me to find time also to read
a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that because i dont have a lot of time
but when i do get to sit down and read i like to read the $unc$bible
and i like to read
i read to my daughter a lot too
do you
and i like to read $unc$bi-
i have $unc$bible storybooks
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i like reading those to her
and she really enjoys those
so thats good
and its kind of short because we dont have a lot of time to read
uh-huh
so its real enjoyable for both of us
yeah
have you ever read any of $unc$frank $unc$e perettis
$unc$frank $unc$e
no
i guess i havent
this present darkness and i forget the other
hes also written a lot of children
how old is your daughter
$unc$five
$unc$five
okay
hes written some childrens books as well
and theyre all spiritually oriented
really
yeah
whats his name again
$unc$peretti
$unc$frank $unc$e $unc$peretti
$unc$frank $unc$e $unc$peretti
$unc$p $unc$e $unc$r $unc$e $unc$t $unc$t $unc$i
i have to look for those
uh-huh
yeah
do
because i love to read his childrens books just
just to read them
thats good
yeah
theyre good
theyre great
thats good
and its usually about a family of archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into digging in old ruins and running across the old gods and things
uh-huh
oh
yeah
that sounds pretty neat
yeah
it is
its real exciting
ill have to look for those
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare
right
so
thats neat
i have a
my daughter has precious moments collection
uh-huh
and i like that because its real easy to follow for her
if i read straight out of the $unc$bible to her shed never understand any of it
its hard for me
thats right
it is real hard to follow and understand
uh-huh
and ive got a $unc$bible that has a little bit of a glossary in the back
and it helps explain who people are
thats about the hardest thing is whos related to who
i know it
and especially its hard to keep your interest in those begats
yeah
yes
yes
it sure is
but it is good reading
and its good for us and everything
uh-huh
thats right
i really do enjoy it
but i also
but then on the other extreme i like to read i dont know horror $unc$steven $unc$king type books
uh-huh
yeah
ive read a lot of his too
the
and i like that
thats good fun reading
yeah
cant put them down
no
you cant
you really cant
they are good
and theyre just so suspenseful
uh-huh
yeah
i really do enjoy his
theres another guy
what can
what is his name
durn
you would
when youre recording you cant remem-
i know
$unc$dean $unc$kratz or $unc$kranz
or
$unc$judith $unc$krantz
y-
who
$unc$judith $unc$krantz
i know her
no
its a guy
okay
and he writes the same thing though
its that real gruesome horror stories
oh
ooh
yeah
thats good
yeah
$unc$koontz
his last name ends in a z i know that
yeah
i think i know who youre talking about
ive seen
i dont think i can pronounce it either
but
yeah
yeah
im in a book club
and i think ive seen his books in there
uh-huh
ive never read any of his
but theyre real
i kind of got burnt out on $unc$steven $unc$king though
it seems like its all the
did you ever read the
its $unc$one of his first books the stand
yes
that long thing
i know it
and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that
yeah
they do kind of follow or are similar
that
uh-huh
i love that book though
i thought it was great
yeah
it really was
and i loved the shining
yes
that was my favorite
those hedges when they started moving
yeah
yeah
whenever they made that into a movie i was thinking my gosh if they show that ill just die
for some reason that scared me more than anything
yeah
that is
he just brings stuff alive
yeah
you could just visualize everything
uh-huh
thats
and that was a pretty scary movie too
yeah
i think they did a pretty good job
but they didnt follow it exactly
yeah
but they did do it justice
uh-huh
thats right
but most of the time they dont follow books very well when they make them into movies
yeah
thats true
i liked $unc$it as well
yeah
yeah
thats another big fat one
i did too
yeah
yeah
that was good
i also liked $unc$cujo
did you read that one
yeah
and
except it broke my heart
yeah
im a dog lover
me too
and then night stand
is that night
no
it was
dead zone
thats $unc$one i liked
what
dead zone
yeah
that was a
ive read that $unc$one too
that was a real good one
hes written a lot of books
boy he just sits down $unc$eight hours a day just like any other job
i know it
right
and then he has some under another name that hes written
thats right
that $unc$one about the $unc$gypsies or that hunger
yeah
or s-
yeah
i think his name was $unc$bachman
he wrote under the name of $unc$bachman
yeah
$unc$richard $unc$bachman
yeah
he is really interesting
yeah
hes so prolific
yeah
i wish i could do that
i know it
and i have gone back
and after i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too
uh-huh
i do too
i love good old
once you can get into the language
the l-
yeah
its $unc$english
but its not the same $unc$english they speak today
right
so its kind of hard to keep at it
but
thats true
but i
that was $unc$one of my favorite subjects in school was literature
yeah
me too
i used to love those good old books
uh-huh
i didnt mind doing that at all
$unc$nathaniel $unc$hawthorne is pretty scary himself
yeah
yeah
i liked
why cant i think of their names
shoot
the $unc$one that wrote wuthering heights
no
no
that was another one
yeah
yeah
you know who im talking about
yeah
yeah
those are good old books and classics
yeah
uh-huh
thats right
right
right
sure is neat
thats why i like to watch that $unc$masterpiece theatre on channel $unc$thirteen because theyll take a classic and televise it put it into a viewing format more or less
yeah
right
right
a lot of people just dont have time to read nowadays
uh-huh
i know its really hard for me
i work $unc$two jobs and have my daughter and teach $unc$sunday school and go to school myself
do you
so its hard for me to sit down and read
i can imagine
but when i do i just love it
yeah
yeah
me too
i think weve accomplished $unc$five minutes
so
i think we have too
thank you very much
its good talking to you
you too
bye-bye
bye-bye
what is your view do you consider the $unc$soviet $unc$union a threat
i dont know that its so much a military threat anymore as a
its real confusing right now to know what kind of a threat it is i guess
sure
it takes awhile to get used to something
if the place has completely turned that much around to where theyre not what they used to be
right
its hard to know anymore if its a threat $unc$one way or another because it used to be so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell rank and file in behind it
uh-huh
and now that with $unc$gorbachev is introducing more i guess expressions of freedom it doesnt look as though everybodys following the same pattern
yeah
and the people who are the staunch military conservative people
you never know gorbachevs future is like whereas in the past it was seen as whoever was the head of the communist party was seen as untouchable
yeah
yeah
i thi-
yeah
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute were getting stuck into something here
if somebodys about to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say were ashamed were not going to do that anymore
uh-huh
exactly
and id like to think that that isnt true
but i
the evidence is that hes let some stuff go the east german situation
right
its just the whole thing is so incomprehensible
if id have been asleep for $unc$five years and read it in a book i said no that couldnt have happened that way
right
its amazing just because of the drain thats been on both economies that our economy of course been able to withstand that a little better
uh-huh
but the russian economy
they
i dont know what the percentages are
but i heard it $unc$one time
its just some ungodly number just to support the military machine
uh-huh
uh-huh
and finally who knows
maybe theyre finally waking up and saying we cant afford this
the $unc$u $unc$s isnt the threat that weve always made them out to be even if theyre saying that beneath the doors
uh-huh
but its hard to thing that just $unc$one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period
yeah
even if it is the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many peoples toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is
yeah
yeah
i think what id have to
i guess to answer the question directly im still just a little bit leery of the whole thing
uh-huh
what i havent seen is a great stepping back in the military situation
right
its $unc$one thing to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
and i even had a thought once that the whole $unc$iraqi thing might have been just a deal to go ahead and let us expend some military hardware
expend
of course it didnt turn out that way
uh-huh
and that may have been a kind of far out way of thinking about it i dont know
its interesting anymore the worlds getting so small that it doesnt seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that was here $unc$twenty years ago
uh-huh
yeah
but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do have not been world powers
so its easier for us to say to an $unc$iraq you cant do this get back or were going to force you
uh-huh
yeah
or we can do something about it
yeah
whereas if the $unc$soviet $unc$union would have who knows what taking over $unc$mongolia or something like that will we have been more just rhetoric rather than going in there officially or physically and try to remove them
uh-huh
yeah
the $unc$china situation when it looked like that thing was turning around
and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the $unc$red $unc$square or wherever said okay
and thats enough
uh-huh
and the tanks came in and pretty much took care of that
exactly
and
yeah
that
personally i dont see $unc$gorbachev as being maybe a threat
and i think hes actually honestly trying to do some change
uh-huh
but i dont believe that he in this first pass around being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
yeah
this would be like if somebody was elected president of the $unc$united $unc$states and suddenly took off toward just some pretty hard by the socialism
uh-huh
and the reaction
the economic
the social structure of the $unc$soviet $unc$union its coming apart at the seams
uh-huh
and ive heard people say its just like the $unc$american $unc$civil $unc$war will there be a union or not
no
its not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole $unc$soviet system was put together under total force
there was no
as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it
right
uh-huh
nobody vo-
a lot
man those people didnt vote to become part of the $unc$soviet $unc$union
they had no choice
yeah
that was always kind of interesting
people
a lot of my friends have taken us down the stance of these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away
and im thinking more of it from a nationalistic
if im a $unc$soviet and if part of south lets say $unc$south $unc$dakota wanted to succeed am i going to stand for that
yeah
i realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with and that they may have been forced im not that familiar with their future
uh-huh
but i
its easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join
yeah
but
the whole thing was put together by force
theres no real question about that
uh-huh
and some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the $unc$three baltic countries came in the forties
uh-huh
and its not that they came in its they were conquered by the $unc$germans
and then just never given back
and then the $unc$russians even took it back from the $unc$germans and never bothered to give it back
yep
so thats a little different situation
that whole a
the whole idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
uh-huh
and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers
and maybe countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isnt going to help you
you can
i guess $unc$israel is a perfect example
yeah
the reason they have the $unc$angolan $unc$heights all their buffer area is between $unc$jordan and the $unc$sinai and $unc$lebanon was just as a buffer
but as you can see the scuds go right over there
uh-huh
yeah
they dont really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
yeah
theres very little that binds you anymore in todays technology
i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to $unc$germany they said thats the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over $unc$germany
and theyre going to land in other places
thats going to be the safest place to be
thats probably very true
ve-
thats very interesting never thought of that
yeah
i guess what theyd have to do to
i really dont know
in the i hope that whats happening is exactly the way it appears
uh-huh
some reason or other is its kind of a strange thing weve been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute
nobody knows what to do
whats really happening here
is it real
uh-huh
but you wonder how this thing
who was it $unc$boris $unc$yeltsin evidently was elected president for the russian republic which is i guess the biggest
right
exactly
i get confused between which is the soviet provinces versus which are the russian provinces versus what are
uh-huh
in the center
but you got the great big area thats was traditionally known as $unc$russia
and then all these little nationality groups around it was there $unc$nineteen of them or whatever
uh-huh
and these were all the $unc$soviet economists they had some real fancy names for them
right
matter of fact when the
yeah
what i read when the $unc$united $unc$nations was setup in $unc$san $unc$francisco $unc$one of the first things the $unc$russians wanted to do was bring in each $unc$one of these republics as a separate country
as a
so there would be $unc$nineteen rather than $unc$one
as a vote
sure
sure
and the $unc$united $unc$states said that mean we get to bring in $unc$forty-eight
and that sort of
they backed down on that
died down on that
i thought it was interesting that recently here the $unc$warsaw $unc$pact no longer exists as a military force
but its merely an economic now
yeah
wonder if that
at
what do you get shot by something thats called an economic force or what is called a military pact
yeah
exactly
its all
you can change the name of something
but i wonder if its still exists
uh-huh
although ive seen some evidence that the russian soldiers are
you
the funny thing there is theyre not particularly welcome back home because theyre having housing shortages now
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by $unc$bulgaria and $unc$czechoslovakia
exactly
and all the
and now all of a sudden theyre going home
and somebodys got to pay for their
thats what theyre saying the whole problem with if we were to demilitarize $unc$europe
what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there
yeah
thats not
whats going to happen to the economies that no longer have a $unc$million plus people in each country from the $unc$u $unc$s
yeah
since you live close i dont know if you know about what $unc$louisville is doing with recycling
or are you familiar with any of that
i know that we have some relatives that live around the area in there
huh-uh
i know theyre doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there
yeah
i read
when they first started doing that in the paper i read about that
i was just praying that that would be in our area because weve been recycling for quite some time
and we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a $unc$metco which is a real pain
huh-uh
so if they would come up curbside recycling
theyll help you recycle because there is some bins behind $unc$wal-mart that take some things
have they moved them behind $unc$wal-mart
yeah
god
because i finally asked because we had all of those milk cartons
and there was nowhere else to take them
and they had it in front of $unc$wal-mart
and i ask in $unc$wal-mart
and they said they moved it just behind
oh
thats really nice to know because we were doing the same thing
because to take it to a $unc$metco you have to take it when theyre open which is always a real pain
huh-uh
and so when that thing came up in $unc$wal-mart parking lot we thought this is great
and we started taking them up there
and then all the sudden it disappeared
i didnt know
and were going no there goes our recycling place
yeah
thats really nice to find out that its behind there
we pretty much do plastic milk cartons and newspapers
i couldnt even think of what you call them
yeah
plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass i guess is really the $unc$four things that we do
aluminum cans
yeah
yeah
thats about what we do too
and thats really about it
is there any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of
i guess down kind of in $unc$north $unc$dallas there is a place that will take almost anything
really
we just dont have the room to store all that much
i know
i dont want to be running down there every week or whatever
i know
i know
were kind of the same way
at first you
at first it was a real hassle
and im wondering are we really going to do this
but you kind of get i guess into a little routine where it is automatic to throw different things in different places
yeah
so i just go
we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen
and ive just got $unc$three trash cans sitting in there
we just kind of dump things in each $unc$one if we get them
yeah
so
those milk cartons take up so much room
they do too
and theyre impossible to crush
you cant get the down to any size
if you get $unc$four milk cartons that fills up trash bag pretty easily
so
i guess we kind of started recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago
really
we were using baby food
and there was so many baby food jars kind of what started it
yeah
yeah
some of our neighbors were doing it
and so when i found out some places to take it
and they also take some things at the $unc$flower $unc$mound dump behind the fire station there
and i know that theyre going to use the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing put lights and stuff
that will be good
so if im not going to get the money for aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of $unc$flower $unc$mound to do something with
sure
let somebody get something out of it
yeah
thats true
and they wont raise our taxes
yeah
yeah
ha-ha
i was kind of hoping with
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
i dont
i have a friend of mine told me about this program is the reason that im
no
yeah
there was a
$unc$t $unc$i has got this organization called $unc$t $unc$a $unc$d which is $unc$t $unc$iers against $unc$drugs
and were recycling aluminum cans up here just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
and there was crushers out in all of the hallways
and thats
they use the money from that to fund this $unc$t $unc$iers against $unc$drugs $unc$program
its
$unc$t $unc$i doesnt give them any money everything is made from that
and they had talked about having a thing like $unc$one $unc$saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home
yeah
and im kind of like yeah
i shall
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it that was going to use it for good
so
sorry
sounds like you have a little one just like i do
shell be $unc$two in $unc$july
yeah
mine was $unc$two in $unc$december
oh
it was good to talk to you
it was nice to talk to you
i know theyve started over in $unc$richardson where my dad lives
they pick up newspapers i think
do they really
curbside pick up
yeah
i really hope they do that in $unc$louisville
it would make it a lot easier on all of us
talk to you later
okay
bye-bye
what do you think about it
how are we doing in recycling
are we
i think we need to do more
i know i need to do more
they have programs around where you can reach the
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up
uh-huh
but i have a hard time of separating my trash
and get all the cans from the paper
yeah
and i just havent gotten that dedicated yet
so
i do a lot of work with the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
and we try to do a lot
uh-huh
but theres still a lot more we can do
yeah
i dont recycle my newspapers myself
but i noticed in $unc$one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a clothes hamper kind of thing that you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up
uh-huh
so i figured i might get me $unc$one of those because we dont always read the newspaper
uh-huh
sometimes it just sits around for a while
and then we just chuck it
yeah
i dont get the paper every day
but i get it on
i try to buy the early edition for the coupons the $unc$sunday edition
so
yeah
but then i just bundle it up and put it on the front walk every $unc$monday or every other $unc$monday and have them pick that up
yeah
but thats the extent of what ive done
id like to be able to do more
the problem with a lot of it is it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it
yeah
and
its not always convenient to do it
yeah
and here in $unc$lubbock everythings so close
i can imagine what its like up there
yeah
im not exactly sure where the can thing is
but sometimes its just so
seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them
yeah
i went out to $unc$payless $unc$cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me $unc$one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall
uh-huh
and then i put me a little $unc$five gallon bucket
and its just outside the garage door
uh-huh
so every time we drink a $unc$coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
do those can crushers work good
yeah
i got $unc$one from $unc$payless $unc$cashways
and its actually metal
uh-huh
its not plastic
i didnt want to buy a plastic one
yeah
because those things i think would just snap
yeah
but $unc$payless $unc$cashways has them
and theyre metal
and i dont know what affiliate of $unc$payless $unc$cashways you have up there
but it was only $unc$seven dollars not too bad
oh
id have to check into something like that because we dont drink a whole lot of soda around here
but occasionally we have some around
yeah
but for other kind of cans itd probably only take aluminum cans like that dont they
yeah
i dont
yeah
i dont think it would crush steel cans
its pretty tough
yeah
so i dont know
i dont think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that
but i need to look into it more
no
you could probably just
it
sometimes even with the newspaper they say theyll only take certain types of paper
they wont take paper thats shiny
yeah
they wont take any lint free paper
or i work at $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
so does my husband
yeah
we do a lot of recycling out there
uh-huh
now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard
but thats just now come on board
uh-huh
weve been throwing paper out there away for years
and were just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big $unc$earth $unc$day thing came out
uh-huh
yeah
i dont know what
i havent
im sure theyre probably doing that here some
yeah
im sure they are
$unc$t $unc$i is doing it pretty well nation-wide im sure
uh-huh
i think its necessary
i like it
it makes
i think its good that you see these boxes cereal
theyre now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper
and ive bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper
yeah
and i think theyre just fine
yeah
i bought a
i got one at work that i bought for $unc$one of the guys there at work
its his birthday
were pretty good friends
and what it is is a recycled paper bag
uh-huh
and its just got happy birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside
and its just a paper bag
uh-huh
and its really cute
yeah
but i think were doing better and better all the time
yeah
still dont
i think were becoming more conscious because we just cant stick everything in landfills any more
so
no
theres not going to be any room shortly
no
no
the office
i dont know what $unc$new $unc$york does about theirs
i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere
yeah
its probably sitting out on the barge somewhere
yeah
but i think were getting better at it
yeah
i think theres quite a bit more we could do
girls put that away
now
but youre right sometimes it does seem like its more trouble than what it would be worth
yeah
i just wish it was a little more convenient to do
yeah
seems like youre so busy anyway
and then thats just $unc$one more thing to have to worry about
so
yeah
it sure is
i think if the cities locally theyd get more programs going so that you could do that itd make it a lot easier
so
yeah
yeah
theyll get at it sooner
i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later
yeah
yeah
get the kids interested in it too
they have
we tried to have an aluminum can drive with the $unc$cub $unc$scouts that i have
and we just dont have any place to store those kind of cans
yeah
if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure theyll save them for us theres no problem there
uh-huh
but what do you do with them in the meantime
thats right
i dont want a garage full of cans
thats right
who does
people dont have room for that kind of stuff
no
theyre not prepared for it
no
and in $unc$texas theyre just get things like that
they just get bugs in them
so
yeah
yeah
they do
so you dont
the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get
thats for sure
thats right
so
im pretty lazy about it right now
everything goes into $unc$one thing and goes out to the
yeah
pick it up
so
yeah
myself
about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans
uh-huh
i need to get better at it
so
if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way
yeah
thats right
thats right
if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then well get there
thats true
thats right
thank you for talking to me
huh
thank you for calling
i
sure
no problem
okay
take care
all right
bye-bye
bye-bye
i assume you have kids
we have $unc$one
shes only $unc$nine months old
she doesnt have to worry about public schools yet
right
my degree is in teaching
so
yeah
we have a little bit of a basis for conversation
i was a substitute teacher for about a year
really
yeah
i thought i wanted to be a teacher
but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it
uh-huh
and they
in $unc$alabama where i came from they allow you to substitute if you got a $unc$four year degree
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels
or
yeah
it was
i just took grades $unc$one through $unc$six
uh-huh
i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong
my degree was in fourth through seventh grade
but i taught junior high
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble
but it wasnt that bad
i taught remedial reading kids
and they dont call it remedial reading these days they call it something else
yeah
but at the time thats what i taught
and you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way when you have your slow readers
uh-huh
but it wasnt too bad
we got long real well
i sometimes wonder if i didnt mess up
i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least if you have to you can get mean with them
those little kids dont understand it
yeah
i
especially with the real young ones
i started out wanting to teach lower like primary and then top primary and thought no i dont like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth
and so thats what i got my certification in
uh-huh
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
yeah
and my reason for that was i dont like whats the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools
thats a nice way of putting it
you can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard
but i dont think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis
exactly
and too most people dont have that option
yeah
and plus it also depends on the district your in as on the
ive seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesnt matter what you do accept for the private ones of course were talking about public
uh-huh
right
i dont know
back when i was going to school you just didnt get away with the things these kids get away with now
uh-huh
you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principals office and usually bending over to get $unc$five of the best
yeah
but nowadays they can barely scold the children for something without getting sued
and the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the lower schools
yeah
the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class
and this kid comes to school with his lunch box
and inside this lunch box hes got easily id say $unc$two $unc$hundred to $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty dollars in $unc$one dollar bills
and i asked him what are you doing with that
and he says my father gave it to me
and i didnt believe it for a minute
uh-huh
but the
not a lot i could do about it
right
cant stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants
crazy for him to
but
i have
ive full-
i think i understood what the kid was doing he was a
lets just say he was $unc$one of those types that you wouldnt doubt that he was selling something
uh-huh
yeah
but not a lot i could do about it
we had the problem when i was teaching
i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with
and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there
uh-huh
and you dont know if you were reaching them or not
but we felt like maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
yeah
because that just
that doesnt do a lot for them
it alleviates your problem
yeah
but it doesnt do anything for them
right
most the time if they were
some of them were even better behaved
ive only had $unc$two instances where it was really noticeable
but they were better behaved when they were
i dont know if was alcohol or something else that they were on
but it ended up better
but
i dont know
guns and
i dont know
its something
i think theres a problem too with teachers trying to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics
theyve been a big drive especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
uh-huh
and im not completely just teach the basics in schools
but i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our lower grades in the standardized test and such
yeah
sure
its indicative across the board that weve done something wrong
right
and when you see $unc$koreans and $unc$chinese and $unc$japanese who are taking all the science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
and here we are
we cant balance a checkbook without a calculator
uh-huh
i dont know
i spent a year and a half in $unc$japan also
and ive seen how their school system works
and i
they go by a complete rote system
you just memorize everything
uh-huh
and then at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out
and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be
yeah
so i dont completely agree with that either
no
but there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
yeah
thats a great deal what law schools like
is it
yeah
is that what you ended up going into
yeah
oh
and i did the same sort of thing
they just
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases
and then you get $unc$one examine for the whole semester
uh-huh
and its how well you can remember it all
how much can you stuff in your brain
yeah
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying
yeah
i never did
i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
uh-huh
and consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories
but they couldnt put $unc$two and $unc$two together as far as the law was concerned
yeah
yeah
it didnt show me anything
a year and a half i gave it up
i wasnt really wa-
i didnt want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i dont know
what can we do about it
good question
probably
money is not the answer
taking
no
theres plenty of money in the system
yeah
its just
yeah
theyre throwing more money at it now than ever before
and things are getting worse
i think its like a lot of things in the $unc$united $unc$states
weve got so much built up in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it
uh-huh
and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
and theres no way that that can be done
uh-huh
not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system
yeah
yeah
maybe on smaller scales
i dont know
i
as much as i didnt like school when i was going through it from my perspective now i can see that its a lot better than what we have now
uh-huh
and i think part of it is that theyve got to give authority back to the local school
yeah
its silly that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
uh-huh
right into the classroom it needs to be able to be enforced
yeah
exactly
teachers are so afraid now of even saying something to students because theyre going to get complaints or theyre going to get sued or something
uh-huh
its like doctors in lawsuits
yeah
theyre kind of fearful of everything
lawyers help create that
thats
at least ive heard that
i havent fortunately been in a situation where its been applicable to me
i think what weve turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers
somebody
okay
were going to send our kid here for $unc$seven or $unc$eight hours a day
and hes out of our hair
right
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
uh-huh
theyre just
yeah
it has to be reinforced in the home
sure
i
you can have the best school system in the world if you dont get anything at home then its not going to help either
yeah
right
so i dont know
i dont know
i dont know what the answer is
uh-huh
its an interesting thing you want to do
i
how is $unc$texas about keeping your children out of public schools
do they allow it
yeah
they allow it under certain circumstances
you have to prove that youre teaching them something
you have to follow a preferred curriculum
uh-huh
they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you dont have to
uh-huh
and then if you have particular religious beliefs theyre kind of monitored
they will allow you to
i cant think of any examples
but certain religious groups dont want their children in public schools because the influence
and maybe they were a group of $unc$mennonites or something like that
uh-huh
i dont think theyre were in this area
but they are monitored by the $unc$state $unc$school $unc$board
thats interesting
i remembering reading a few cases about when some people first tried that and they got sued got taken to court by the school system
uh-huh
im glad the parents won
it seems silly that we started
thats the way you got your education in this country
uh-huh
and then
i dont know
i grew up in the sixties
and at that time it was a changing time for the whole music scene i guess
and i grew up with the $unc$beatles and the $unc$rolling $unc$stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and thereafter
but have since
i grew up in a small town in southern $unc$oklahoma
i have kind of gone back to more of a county flavor in music
im not quite sure why that is
and it seems like almost a opposite
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot sounding music
it didnt have i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a story
it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up
and ive become i guess more of a country fan over the years
when you say that you grew up in the sixties i take it that was the teenage type years
or
yeah
that was my teenage years
i was born in $unc$fifty
and
okay
were very similarly aged
so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times
so im just a couple years older than you
yeah
essentially i was $unc$one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for $unc$one reason or another i didnt pay much attention to music
but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
my early popular music interests were in $unc$simon and $unc$garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college
and i became attached to that style of urban country if there is such a thing
yeah
i think in a way one could talk about $unc$simon and $unc$garfunkel that way because they do tend to have a dramatic or story approach to their music usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it
over time i became very interested in baroque classical
and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it very relaxing for me
my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat $unc$simon
yeah
its something that interests me combined with the classical tastes i had mentioned
and my classical music tends to be confined to the $unc$seventeen hundreds early $unc$eighteen $unc$hundred music
im not a music
im not particularly schooled in it
i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music
and i spent a good deal of time listening also to people from the late seventies $unc$neil $unc$diamond for instance people of that particular time
thats kind of the way i am
uh-huh
i listen to some country and western
but im not schooled in it
and ive enjoyed the times when i have listened to it
i played a little bit of piano
i continue to do that
i want to do it
and i never have the discipline to stay with it
but when i do play and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a new piano player
its got basically an easy rhythm and tone
right
and its well easily something to fall into
im kind of the say way
ive gone through different periods of life in music from pop to classical
i guess $unc$one of the things that influenced me was that ive worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there
and was support
i was influenced by all different kinds of music
but basically because thats where i worked
and ive developed a real love for classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was heavy into classical type music
he said he used to sit on $unc$saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music that they were using behind them because they used especially $unc$disney used a lot of classical music behind the cartoons
and so consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there
and i think that got deep seated into me
$unc$one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is are those that call on those classical roots i guess $unc$barry $unc$manilow comes to mind for some reason theres not a whole lot of his stuff that im real crazy about
but he does have some things
$unc$chicago had some things
right
and i think even $unc$electric $unc$light $unc$orchestra had some real influences by classical music
and im still
my favorite
in fact most of my c d are classical music
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music
i dont know which is chicken and egg in that situation
a good example would be
i have connections but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations
uh-huh
and i found that i really like $unc$china beach
and i particularly like tour of duty
and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
yeah
and $unc$thirty something im particularly interested
but its the music almost that i find myself listening to
yeah
im kind of thinking thats maybe
our generation was so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness now with the music thats behinds them
that could well be
i spent my sophomore and junior year in college when i
a song by the
i think the title of it was just $unc$downtown
uh-huh
and if you recall how it goes downtown ta da da da
right
all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of difficult times in school being behind on work
uh-huh
and my family now knows if they come into my study and i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe im trying to get a project done at school and im humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to $unc$downtown they know to just stay away
thats their signal
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it
yeah
thats right
when did you first take your first piano lesson
probably about first grade
yeah
and i have returned about every $unc$four or $unc$five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes
and then inevitably i am swept away by the pressure of other types of things
yeah
it is a time consumer
it is
in order to continue to grow and
i always think that ill be able to do it
and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really cant quite understand what is that other people take for granted in composition themes
yeah
and i
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them
i have a pretty good mathematical concept for whats involved
right
but in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude
and i keep thinking i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand
but it doesnt for me
no
its making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it
i was never able to master all that
in fact my brother and sister both they were $unc$thirteen $unc$sixteen years older than i they went through the parent thing where youve got to practice or youre not going out to play thing
and when it came to my turn the folks said no were not going through that again
they sold the piano
and turns out i was the only $unc$one who really had an interest in it and never got to
so i
uh-huh
thats $unc$one of things i felt like i missed in life
and i really
in fact $unc$one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to $unc$chopin that is played on piano
i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
maybe $unc$one of these days ill
im kind of like you maybe $unc$one of these days ill get around to it
ill do something with the piano
but probably not
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance
just never got a chance to come out
no
thats the most fascinating thing
its a pleasure talking with you
and you sir
best of luck in your graduate school
take care
okay
good-bye
good-bye
okay
do you want to go first
i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic
fitness and exercise
god
no
why dont you go first
okay
i like to do weight training and cycling and just walking swimming
i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall
and the doctor said that running and jumping isnt real good for my knee anymore
so i had to kind of change my life-style a little bit
let me ask a personal question
how old are you
$unc$thirty-eight
then you should
over $unc$thirty-five everything goes downhill flop
the rest of me is in pretty good shape
its just that left knee that just doesnt want to do everything it used to
youre lucky then
because ive battled arthritis all my life
really
even since i was about $unc$two or $unc$three
oh
then they diagnosed it
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled
and i do water aerobics religiously do water aerobics
i bet that helps
uh-huh
i used to do it about $unc$six times a week
and now im down to about $unc$four
but its about the only thing that keeps my mobility in there
i tried weight training
and im telling you i just cant lift the things
yeah
and the shock on the system is just too much
so i have stuck to water aerobics basically the weightless thing and trying to keep this shape that way
yeah
but its hard to find
its really hard to find a place thats going to offer water aerobics because what im finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way to get in shape without having to spend anything
thats right
thats right
or its the geriatric crowd
thats right
so ive considered even becoming licensed to teach it
if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself
and you probably do
yeah
but you have to have an indoor pool
this is true
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without drawing a lot of looks means youre really going to do a strenuous workout activity
you look very odd in the water
that
that was the $unc$one place where i was also able to do weight training
and that does look very odd in the water
i can believe that
have you tried the pool at the $unc$spring $unc$creek $unc$fitness $unc$center
no
and thats the only place i havent tried
and people have told me
thats the $unc$texins facility
yes
i have been told that thing is just lovely
it is
they keep it at $unc$eighty-one degrees year-round
huh
he-
do you use that facility a lot
a fairly good amount more on the weekends
i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the $unc$dallas $unc$fitness $unc$center
huh
do you know if they have child care there
have you done your attitude survey for this year yet
you need to put that on there seriously
they dont
i dont work at $unc$t $unc$i
you dont
no
i used to work at $unc$t $unc$i
oh
as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position
when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry
and i used to fill out those attitude surveys
yeah
and me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other
and my husband still works there
yeah
and i get my attitude expressed through them
but i find it to be very
sometimes its kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks
this is true
and never having lived in $unc$texas before i starting working for $unc$t $unc$i
and i came down here
and they did an attitude survey like $unc$six weeks after i had been working here
and i asked about day care for the shift workers
yeah
and i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just dont say that
its not
it was not applicable to me
and i was kind of horrified
what year are we talking about
were talking $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-eight
okay
things have become much more enlightened since then
they couldnt have gotten anymore in the dark ages
yeah
we still dont have a day care facility
but people are more sympathetic to it
i understand that theyre now covering womens preventative health care
yes
yes
and the reason im at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back i tell you how much in the dark ages it was i had been rated number $unc$one in the field
and then i took
when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby $unc$three months early
oh
my gosh
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home
and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment
could you hold the phone for $unc$one second
sure
thanks
okay
im back
and then they used to
and then i had a second one $unc$eighteen months later
they told me to put them back to back
and of course to maintain
and i was flat on my back for the last $unc$five months with the second one because thats when i go into labor $unc$four and a half months
wow
and i dont even know it
of course its real easy to take care of the first one when youre on your back
yeah
very easy
very easy
and they put me on $unc$twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to try to control the labor and see how far it was going
and after the baby was born since it wasnt premature then they said they wouldnt cover the cost of the monitor
i think thats kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a $unc$thirteen $unc$thousand dollar bill
really
but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work
yeah
and that was when they had
god it would have been the $unc$eighty-five layoff
yeah
and ill tell you how they handled this
and i was just outraged
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been terminated until i filed my insurance claims about $unc$four months later
and they didnt have any coverage under my name
and i went back
and i said what the hell is going on here
yeah
really
and they told me your husband works here
and hes got a good salary
we didnt think that youd be coming back anyway
and weve got people here that really need to be working
and so that we had just
it was this way we didnt have to layoff an active person
and wed just let you go
and it took me about a year of arguing
i said ive got to put this in writing to me because until they put it in writing i couldnt get my insurance benefits
yeah
and i couldnt get my termination benefits either
there you go
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that
i can believe that
but i guess things have gotten better
ive been told that this flex hour and those kind of things
yeah
flex time is great
i still dont think after my experiences that they could get me to go back ever again
i can understand
i can understand
its been good talking with you
but let me ask you this since you use texans
how much is it a month
shoot its only about $unc$ten bucks a month
thats for individual
yeah
to add dependents is maybe another dollar or something
its no big deal
thats it
yeah
if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes your taking
you do for classes
but to use any of the facilities is no extra charge
god thats cheap
yeah
it is
thats really cheap
do you have to be an active $unc$t $unc$i employee to join $unc$texans or a depe-
or a depe-
or a dependent of $unc$one
god i am so dependent these days
really
its a sense
seen that my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence
wonderful
yeah
so my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment
but boy i think im going to go contact $unc$texans
i really think i am
yeah
that beats any offer ive heard in a long time
yeah
its great
huh
all righty
when youre there on weekends is it crowded as hell
it would depend on when you go
its not excessively crowded on the weekends
id want to be there in the mornings from $unc$nine $unc$thirty to $unc$ten $unc$thirty
i dont think that would be bad at all
if youre in $unc$richardson youd probably wanted to come to the $unc$dallas site
im actually right on the $unc$plano line
then you could go either $unc$one
yeah
the $unc$spring $unc$creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more niceties amenities
and youd probably like the pool there
god it sounds like i would
i might do that then
okay
i learned something here
good
im glad
you can go back to work now
thank you
thank you
you have a good day
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
i guess this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do hand work
mostly i do needlepoint i guess
really
but
what kinds of things have you done
ive made a lot of baby gifts
uh-huh
it seem like thats
especially lately theres been so many babies bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings
do you ever keep any of your stuff
isnt that funny
no
i do crochet and a lot of things like that
and i have very little of my own stuff
and its kind of embarrassing
people say let me see some of your work
can you do it
yeah
isnt that funny
i guess i do have $unc$one thing
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit
ooh
and i needlepointed the face
and i kept that because she gave me that
so
that would be definitely something youd want to keep
yeah
and its real neat
was the whole face done or just the numbers and like minute marks
basically the whole
no
i guess the minute marks
but the minute marks are done theyre like hearts
oh
and then the
at the numbers theyre kind of outlined and stuff
it was quite bit of work
but it was a lot of fun too
i really like doing stuff like that
so
i did some needlepoint years ago
and then i got into the $unc$bargello
whats that
its an italian needlework using the
i started to say the canvas
but the
what kind of cloth uses that
ive just gone blank
but its used with yarn
and it usually takes long stitches over $unc$two or $unc$three openings in the cloth
huh
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors
it could be a flame stitch where rather than drawing a picture youre making a design like a geometric or whatever
and it was used quite often in the colonial times to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel embroidery work that was done on them
thats interesting
what kind of things did you do
what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows for sofas and so forth
and i cant find $unc$one that ive done
oh
its $unc$one of those things
i didnt give them away
but i didnt know if its been my color choice or multiple moves or what
yeah
and it
i was so proud of them when i got them finished
but i have no idea where they are
what did you call that
$unc$bargello
its $unc$b $unc$a $unc$r $unc$g $unc$e double $unc$l $unc$o
huh
thats
ive never heard of that before
ive probably seen it though
i suspect you have
when you described it
yeah
when you described it it sounded like something that would be around i guess
but ive never heard of it before
and its really interesting
i guess ive decorated baskets and stuff before in the past
but ive kind of gotten out of that
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
me too
really
yes
thats interesting
yeah
it is
how did you know to choose this subject tonight
thats funny
what
how did you
what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas-
how were you decorating the baskets
basically bows and lace ribbons
i really wanted to do
so many of them now have the ribbons where im not sure how they do it
but the ribbons they make them they
i dont know how to explain it
they make them hard
like fabric thats been stiffened
yeah
yes
ive never done that
and those are so neat
i would really like to do those
ive seen some
and there they
i suspect theyre fairly simple because the $unc$one lady ive seen i know that does it ive never asked her any questions
but she has $unc$three kids all under the age of like $unc$six
and theyre all a handful
so its got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
definitely
yeah
when i do crochet its usually the lacy victorian type things like that
oh
and i stiffen those with a glue mixture
its like white glue
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those draping streamers i dont know
oh
i was just
theres bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that thats very similar thats not going to melt too much with high humidity in a room
yeah
i think thats what my concern was was it really sure and how they would last
do you know what my concern is
how will i dust this thing
youre right
thats terrible
no
thats true
thats funny
so many of my crafts
right now im looking at a little quilted hanging
its a flag
and i dont want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth
but its such a dust collector to be out and so forth
yeah
and most of my things are dust collectors
and i hate to dust
i know
so first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean
thats funny
no
i do some
i have really gotten out of it
i dont do it quite as much as i used to i guess because i went back to school
so i dont have as much time
you dont have time
no
and i have $unc$two children also
you definitely dont have time
it keeps me very busy
but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance
its really
its so relaxing to just sit
but once i get started i cant put it down
i just
i have a similar problem
ive got to have time
or i dont even want to get into it in the first place
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
i know
i started a project its been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for $unc$christmas
you just didnt say which $unc$christmas right
thats what i keep telling this person
i didnt tell you what year
what was this project
its cross stitch
and its a picture
and its a wildlife
it has deer and trees
and its really beautiful
but its going to be a lot of work
and i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as id like to
its just so hard
this is done in the needlepoint
uh-huh
i should-
its counted cross stitch is what im doing
and so since its counted its really a lot of work
yes
yes
i do know
yeah
i have done a little bit of that
but i decided that thats something that demands my total attention
uh-huh
and so ive got to have almost total silence
i cant really watch television if the pattern is very intricate
it sounds like youd have lots of shading on that particular piece
uh-huh
yep
it does not sound like an easy one to finish
no
it really isnt
and i tell you i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling im never going to get it done
im probably going to hear about it the rest of my life
im sure youll get it done
but it just may not of the original
obviously not of the original time schedule
no
thats true
i just dont know when im ever
it just seems like theres just never enough time to pick it up and do it
its just really hard
but i really do en-
i said i really enjoy it when i do
its just hard
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated
uh-huh
and theres so many other things that i have done in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts
ive made a lot of bibs and wall hangings
and so those dont take much time at all
so its no big deal for me to pick those up and do them
do you use a book of patterns
or do you go out an buy a kit for a bib or something like that
no
i usually just buy a pattern book
i have several pattern books
and i just go with those
okay
and then i buy the bibs separate
usually i think its a little bit cheaper in the long run
and then i just use whatever colors i want to
i dont usually use the colors they tell me to
and it depends on what it is
but some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to
thats what i would do too
yeah
yeah
or whatever i have
theres a few designs i guess ive done myself but not very many
real simple ones i do
i made a little thumb print and made it a bunny
ooh
it was really easy
just did a thumb print
what with ink
uh-huh
okay
and then i didnt cross stitch the actual thumb print
that was just the ink
and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth
that was so simple
that sounds really neat
it didnt take anything at all
did you use a stamp pad and ink
uh-huh
and then i just
ok
so you
just like being finger printed
okay
so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
a lot
the last movie i saw but it wasnt my choice was the ninja turtle movie
obviously you have kids
thats right
yeah
but my preference is the $unc$one we saw before that was silence of the lambs
i havent seen that one yet
thats an excellent movie
the last movie i saw was sleeping with the enemy
was that good
i heard
im not a big $unc$julie $unc$roberts fan
okay
but i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be
thats good
it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be
yeah
yeah
it was a pretty good movie
silence of the lambs kept me on the edge of my seat
im ready to go
it just
its hasnt worked out that way yet
right
it looks good if you like thrillers
yeah
it is
right
and i do
in fact people ive talked to said that they hadnt slept real good for a while afterwards
so
really
i love them like that
yeah
im not
i like all ranges of movies
but i like that where they run tense
uh-huh
i really enjoy
they keep me guessing the whole time
it was really interesting
uh-huh
what other movies have you seen then lately
oh
other than the
i assume you were talking about the new ninja turtles
yes
the new one of course
is that any good
im sure im going to be seeing it because in a week to $unc$amarillo where my sister lives and shes got $unc$two boys that i took to see the first one
oh
so im sure im going to see the next one here real soon
$unc$amarillo
i didnt see the first one
my husband said it was about the same lines
then it wont be too bad
so yeah
it wasnt impressive necessarily
but it was better than it could have been
right
right
and i was impressed with the fact that it wasnt that childish
yeah
you know what i mean
it wasnt
my daughters $unc$five
she understood everything
she goes to almost all movies with us except r rated
and she really enjoyed it
but it was on a higher level where there were some things that kids didnt understand that adults did
and i liked that
yeah
i think thats important if parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi for them too
right
thats right
thats right
yeah
its pretty good
but we take her to just about every movie
and she does really good
weve taken her from real young
and she does real good
like i said we dont take her to r
uh-huh
so if and when we ever get a baby-sitter like we did with silence of the lambs we go see it
is about to say youre not going to take her to that $unc$one im sure
no
no
do you go to a lot of comedy movies
or to
yeah
yeah
what was the last comedy you saw
gosh what was the last comedy we saw
good question
good question
we dont get to go that often
but something on the tip of my tongue
and i cant think of which $unc$one it was
gosh i cant remember
the last
in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw
uh-huh
i said that wrong
the last movie i saw was the hard way with $unc$michael $unc$j $unc$fox
but that sounds good
that really wasnt too bad
there were
hes supposed
hes this actor right
uh-huh
and hes playing a cop
right
or hes hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff
i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
okay
there were times when hed be running with a gun or whatever
he didnt look like a cop when he did it
and i was so impressed with that because usually
thats neat
the part was hard to do that
yeah
because everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to imitate them or whatever
right
and i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
yeah
by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part he was trying to get it
right
but he wasnt there yet
right
and you could tell it
and i guess that i thought was a real good acting and writing job both or directing job
i think they did a real good job of that
uh-huh
and $unc$james $unc$woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop
he just
yeah
i like him
yeah
and there were some definite should i say tense moments with him in there
probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is home alone
yes
i had seen it before $unc$christmas
but i took a date to it about a month ago
so ive seen it the second time not too long ago
so
it was really cute
i really enjoyed it
of course the bad thing about it was the second time i saw it i didnt really enjoy it as much
and i was kind of surprised at that
i thought that would be $unc$one of those that i would love to watch over and over
yeah
but before
maybe its just the idea of my reaction to the first time i had laughed so hard i was hoarse
uh-huh
uh-huh
i was hoarse getting out of there
yeah
and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didnt have it
it just wasnt as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time
right
i dont know
but
maybe so
maybe so
yeah
it was a great movie though
i loved the movie
yeah
i did too
im looking forward to this summer naked gun $unc$two and a half is coming out
i love those movies
i do too
they are just slapstick
yeah
it
you have to see those twice to catch everything
you have to see them more than that
yeah
yeah
i still catch things in airplane that i didnt catch
yeah
its amazing
i do too
i love those movies
i do too
i really do
so im looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do
yeah
yeah
we try to go a couple times a month i guess to see a movie
uh-huh
its just getting so expensive
isnt it though
but thats at least the good thing about the $unc$texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper
but normally we dont think about it until
thats exactly what i was going to say
i keep not doing it until after im there
and then all of a sudden im saying i wish id bought these things
i know because we can go spend $unc$fifteen dollars just getting in the $unc$three of us
easily
yeah
yeah
and then if you want popcorn and stuff
yeah
i dont understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both
popcorn is not that expensive
no
nowhere near that expensive
so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke
and its just the idea that these actors live in such lavish style
its as simple as that
yeah
we just keep breeding them
yeah
and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them
i guess so
have you seen dances with wolves
yes
yeah
that was an excellent movie
i havent seen
were waiting for the video
no
dont
no
really
dont
that needs the big screen
oh
it really and truly does because to get the feeling of when theyre chasing the buffalos and everything youve got to be where you feel it
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
you really truly do
oh
i would
i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too
but im glad i didnt
i really and truly am
that was $unc$one movie i came out impressed
uh-huh
i really and truly did
i have absolutely no problems with them winning $unc$seven $unc$oscars
none at all
right
normally im $unc$one of these people that i dont like $unc$one movie taking all the honors
everythin-
yeah
yeah
i wanted him to win best actor on top of it
he was
yeah
like i said i wouldnt given the supporting actresses either one
yeah
but even though they were okay the girl in it
they
somebody made an interesting observation
now that i think back on it id say yeah i cant believe that either
she was the only $unc$indian to have her hair done at all times
you know what i mean
it was just too perfect at all times
yeah
that was a mistake that they made
they shouldnt have done it
yeah
the best
the supporting actor he was good
but from what i heard the guy who got it was better
so i can see that
yeah
but
you think my daughter would like it
there is $unc$one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side
okay
but its
she doesnt mind when we cover up her eyes
okay
no problems
its just the idea that there is this $unc$one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped the hides
so theres
that is honest to $unc$god the $unc$one reason i dont want to see the movie is because i love buffalos for some weird reason
yeah
but and of course
and i know theyre fake
and yeah
that and plus part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt
so they are killing buffalos in it
but they dont stress that very much
they really dont
okay
okay
and i think its an excellent movie for
if she enjoys movies i think itll work pretty good
thatll be good
we really need some
my husband keeps wanting to
its a long movie
yeah
and i heard the videos even going to be longer
yeah
they did a lot of stuff that they cut out
i may have to see the video
yeah
thats true
they said
i hadnt even thought of that
yeah
they said theres a lot that had been edited because of the length that they wanted in
uh-huh
so theyre going to put it in the video
yeah
and that way you can watch it at your leisure
yeah
i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said
there are certain things you cant do with a video
yeah
and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
yeah
yeah
because when you rent a video
videos of course are not cheap either
true
and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they make bundles of money off those things
i know it
isnt that ridiculous
we have cable which helps a lot
i do too
yeah
but not enough
yeah
we keep holding out
yeah
im getting to the point where i watch $unc$nick at $unc$night
okay
do you have
are you there
yeah
okay
there okay
okay
had to mess with my phone here
do you have children
yes
i have $unc$one
okay
how about you
i have $unc$three
my goodness
yeah
yeah
do you work
yeah
i do
okay
i do
i work
and brians in a day care center
he was $unc$two in $unc$december
oh
so hes not quite $unc$two and a half yet
uh-huh
he
i put him
im kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have
uh-huh
i put him in a day care center from the very beginning
he started in day care when he was $unc$eight weeks old
no kidding
and i just
i dont know
i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people
really
i have had this real problem with a private individual
i kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with private individual when the door shuts that $unc$one person has total control
yeah
yeah
and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around
yeah
and if you get $unc$one bad apple theres are at least other people that can see it
yeah
they can watch
and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
because theres
how can you help depending on the day care center
yeah
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers
have you ever noticed theyre always a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it kind of thing
its a family thing
yeah
yeah
you never hear about it really in the big ones
yeah
so thats what i did
and i have had just excellent luck
good
i have been just so happy
hes
good
i was just going to ask you if you liked the
but obviously you do or you wouldnt have him there i know
but
right
right
he was in the same center for the first $unc$two years
uh-huh
and it was wonderful
and i loved it
and i was so happy there
and the woman who owned it sold it
gosh
but i thought okay im going to keep an open mind here
right
and the people who came in it just wasnt the same
wasnt the same
and their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i left him there for about a month and just decided i cant do this anymore
and i moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience
yeah
but hes done well
was it
yeah
hes been there a couple of months now
good
and i just feel so lucky
good
yeah
thats great
thats good
how about you
do you work
or do you get to stay home with them
i got to stay home with my kids for the first $unc$ten years
my oldest one is $unc$ten and a half now shes i guess
wonderful
yeah
its
was about $unc$ten years
so i was really happy that i was able to do that
but i
thats what i wanted to because i just couldnt wait to have kids
and so if i was so anxious to have them
and i couldnt wait to have them it would be kind of silly to go back to work as soon as i had them
so
right
right
so it was really great
by the end of the $unc$ten years i was really ready to go back to work
yeah
i bet
and my youngest was only $unc$two and a half
uh-huh
she was already $unc$two and a half
uh-huh
so she wasnt an infant
a baby
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i felt real good about that
but boy i tell you with summer coming up im just pulling my hair out in terms of what im going to do
i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago
and i worked full time all last year
and now im going to school part time and graduate school
and im working part time
and so im still
i know how that goes
yeah
im still going full time
but i only have half time salary
yeah
and when school lets out i have no idea what im going to do because i certainly cant afford what we did last year which was
right
right
did you have them in a center or something last summer
we did
we had all different things
we sent them to camp
$unc$one
first month in $unc$june they went to summer school then the second month they
$unc$one
my daughter went home to visit my $unc$mom for a while and my son went to camp
and there we had i dont know some
forget what else we did
but it was all really expensive
yeah
that stuff is expensive
it really is
so now theyre a year older
and i
my daughters going to be $unc$eleven this summer
and my son will be $unc$nine and a half
and so im not
i think i can leave them home
for a
if i can work part of the day im going to leave them home
yeah
yeah
i was going to say theyre getting to the age where you should be able to trust that a little bit
right
yeah
yeah
yes
in fact im doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do
thats okay
but the $unc$four year old before i went back to work really in a home day care situation
uh-huh
and weve just been really thrilled with it too
we were what
actually we
it took us $unc$two or $unc$three different people to find
to find the right one
yeah
thats what we have to do though
right
but i wasnt embarrassed to shop around
no
so the person we found it through the
theres an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that
where do you live
in $unc$plano
$unc$plano
yeah
and they have a number you can call
and all these people are registered with their association
and go like our
i dont want to call her a baby-sitter
shes doesnt like to be called that
care provider
care provider
right
she goes to seminars
and
thats wonderful
she gets home visitations by i dont know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association
and they have weekly meetings and everything
and so its just really really well regulated
thats great
and shes just great
in fact shes all upset because $unc$galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall
and she says this is it
im not going to have her anymore
and i said no dont count on that
after noon classes shes going to be here because shes going to morning kindergarten
right
right
but weve tried everything
and $unc$one year i guess last year when i went back to work i had
my son was $unc$eight at the time just barely $unc$eight
and we put him in amreins $unc$day $unc$care after
uh-huh
ive heard that they were very good
thats why we picked it because they were supposed to be real great
and i think they were fine
but the thing is he was in school all day in second grade
uh-huh
in $unc$plano its open classroom situation where they dont have walls
uh-huh
so there is like a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty second graders in the same area with no walls
oh
and then hed get on the amreins $unc$bus to go to amreins
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room
yeah
what fun they had with these computer games
and then theyd go outside for awhile
they had snacks and story time and everything
but it was just like going to school until $unc$five $unc$thirty at night instead of being able to get home at $unc$two $unc$thirty
poor kid was in school all day
yeah
yeah
yeah
because he was always around with a crowd of kids he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some peace and quiet
uh-huh
or
uh-huh
even at that age they need that time
yes
we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day
yeah
right
thats exactly it
so another thing that we tried to do
i know your sons too young right now
but we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that
yeah
yeah
and
i think thats really important
yeah
and weve already started about
how young can they start t-ball and soccer
right
i just
we both think of that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that
it is
and you could hardly wait
it is
and
hes so much fun now
yeah
hes really starting to get lots of fun
and i cant wait until stuff like that starts happening
i bet
yeah
and we did the $unc$easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to
uh-huh
understand
and to know what he was doing and enjoy it
yeah
and it was so much fun
and he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant
and god he got up on this elephant all by himself
my gosh
youre kidding
and lord i couldnt believe it
youre kidding
they had so much fun
thats great
i bought us tickets and stood there in line
and i thought im going to end up on this elephant with him
he did it by himself
good for him
so stuff like that is starting to come along where its really getting fun
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
day care has just done just incredible stuff with him
and he comes home with something new everyday
and so i know theyre working with him
thats great
thats so good
and hes excited to get there in the morning and just doesnt even want to kiss me good-bye
uh-huh
its just like bye
and he goes running
hes out of there
and hes always having fun when i pick him up
so yeah
this day care is
uh-huh
its $unc$bright $unc$steps in $unc$lewisville
and
uh-huh
whenever you say $unc$bright $unc$steps everybody goes ive heard thats the best day care in town
yeah
good
and its $unc$one of those thats very hard to get into
uh-huh
and this woman owns $unc$three day cares $unc$two in $unc$lewisville and $unc$one in $unc$irving
uh-huh
and she had to open the second one up in $unc$lewisville because her waiting list was just a year old
uh-huh
it was ridiculous
my gosh
and shes got $unc$two day cares within $unc$three blocks of each other
no kidding
yes
so its
she knows something right that she
and
she knows what shes doing
about half the teachers are degreed teachers
yeah
that makes such a difference
it makes a huge difference
thats the way it is at my daughters nursery school too
uh-huh
and i think that really makes a difference
yeah
theyre in it because its a profession not because its a job they could get because they didnt qualify for anything else
thats right
thats right
thats right
and his old day care as much as i loved it
uh-huh
and the owner i really liked her
and she worked really hard to get good people
but the people that she got were there because they werent qualified to do anything else
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and i got lucky
and all of his teachers were very good
because
right
sometimes thats fine
thats great
yeah
but then sometimes
sometimes it isnt
you just have to
yeah
is it real expensive then
it just went up the first of this month
im paying $unc$seventy $unc$nine dollars a week for now
uh-huh
so
wow
its a little high
yeah
but its like where he was before i was only paying $unc$sixty $unc$three
so theres quite a little jump there
right
right
but i looked all over $unc$lewisville
i looked in every day care there was in $unc$lewisville
uh-huh
and there were places that were cheaper
uh-huh
but is it
no
your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money
yeah
and i have peace of mind where he is
uh-huh
and some of those other places i wouldnt have
thats exactly it
we do the same thing
since $unc$galen goes to nursery school we pay for our day care provider full time for a whole week
but shes gone $unc$three mornings
$unc$galen just doesnt go there $unc$three mornings a week
yeah
yeah
but i said to her i said it doesnt matter if for whatever re-
when school holidays come around i used to have such a problem with that
uh-huh
they wouldnt have anything to do
id either have to
okay
have you ever had a family reunion
yes
oh
and let me tell you
this is a really neat thing to do too that they did
i didnt do it
some of the older people organized it
uh-huh
and what they did they had a book made up
and it was like when our ancestors first came over
oh
no kidding
and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family like how many kids you had and who you had married
huh
and it went through
and it showed who my husbands parents were and who he married and then how many children we had and then his brothers and sisters
uh-huh
and it went through the whole family and stuff
thats so neat
and it was so good
great
yeah
but it really did
plus its got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of
uh-huh
yeah
so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up about it
right
uh-huh
and then you could get it at the reunion
right
and everybody got a book that came to the reunion
nice
and it told where the first $unc$connallys came over
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had
and it just kept coming on up through the generations
wow
so that was really neat
that is neat
and
so do you have a big family
he does
he does
yeah
he does
i dont
but he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any
thats kind of how my husband and i are
i have a kind of a big family
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents
uh-huh
and thats it
so he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together
yeah
thats what happened when i first met my husband
i said this cant be
nobody can have this many relatives
because a lot of them lived in a group down $unc$one highway
uh-huh
uh-huh
and there was a lake
and they all lived down there by it
how nice
and so we were going down the highway
and he kept saying this is where my uncle lives
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle
my gosh
and i kept thinking this guy is putting me on
nobody has this many relatives
yeah
but they really were all there
how funny
and another thing thats really good about family reunions is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it because nobody it seemed liked the same thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
but you had a choice
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and get a lot of good recipes
yeah
yeah
where if you said a certain thing and say okay were all going to have fried fish or were all going to have fried chicken
yeah
yeah
everybody might not like that
not be able to do it
so did people come from out of town to the reunion
or
yeah
yeah
they did
they came from all over
did you put them up in other peoples houses
or did you have hotel rooms
or how did you do it
they just stayed with different ones of them
they did
uh-huh
they just came down and say okay this aunt and $unc$uncle $unc$kip all their kids and their grand kids and everything
and then they had it
uh-huh
it had gotten so big that they had it at the church
really
and they had a church service ahead of it
and then they ate out on the ground
how nice
and they just brought food with them
uh-huh
did they just have over a weekend
is that how they did it
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
im real curious because my family
it didnt sound
i dont think my family is as big as your husbands
i dont think wed need a whole church
but the problem is we are all really scattered around
there isnt any $unc$one place where most of us live
so if we ever had a reunion wed kind of all have to stay in a hotel
there would be $unc$one person who lived there that would have a house
but they couldnt put everybody up
so i think it would get kind of expensive
but you know what you can do
huh
a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located about the same distance for all of you all to come
uh-huh
they have these places where you can rent them
and it on a lake
uh-huh
its a big place
its got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its not very expensive that way
you mean
so
i see
so everybody could stay together
right
they have a convention type thing
yeah
a house or something
uh-huh
and then it has little rooms off of it where youd go and sleep at night time
oh!
but then it has a kitchenette and things like that
but you
that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something
right
and another
and then every time you wanted to go eat with somebody youd probably have to go to out eat or something
it would run into a lot of money
so
yeah
but they had
that was
that
that sounds like fun
what you can do is you can write different places the $unc$chamber of $unc$commerce tell them what youre interested in
uh-huh
uh-huh
ask them what they have at area lakes and all if they have something like that
uh-huh
yeah
because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the $unc$chamber of $unc$commerce of where were going because you can find out so much easier that way than try to locate it
uh-huh
you get a
yeah
calling different places can really run you up a bill
yeah
but if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance
you cant get it exact usually
yeah
and then everybody goes to that place
and that is not bad at all
uh-huh
uh-huh
but lot of times theyll have little cabins
uh-huh
and $unc$three or $unc$four or $unc$five families can stay in those cabins because they have just the single bunk beds and stuff
uh-huh
and they can all stay in those cabins
and then you can have cookouts and stuff like that
that doesnt cost you as much
that would be great
that would be really nice
yeah
but thats the best way i found because whenever you have something where you go and
yeah
that sounds good
we had $unc$one
this was before i lost a lot more of my family
but it wasnt any of my immediate family because i didnt have any of them left
uh-huh
but they had thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i didnt think that was as good because it was like you couldnt really talk and stuff like you could when you were at the lake or somewhere where you were out
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant
and you have to sit at a table and just
yeah
yeah
and it just
i didnt like that much
did you
was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite
did you have to draw a line
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line
no
they just
whoever wanted to come
what they did was they wrote to all the initial people the oldest ones
uh-huh
right
okay
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones
uh-huh
and they had
i think there was $unc$four or $unc$five different people that would call some of them if they didnt have their addresses and all on them
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming
yeah
right
and then when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter to get the information and all it asked will you be willing to bring
uh-huh
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
i see
and so really there wasnt any problem with
thats the reason it ended up in a church because there was just so many of them
yeah
yeah
but it turned out so much better like that because they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
yeah
right
if there was a sickness or something like that youre not going to lose that many
sure
sure
no that would just be a few
right
but how about because of divorce and stuff like that
my parents are divorced
okay
and they are both remarried
and theres
i dont know
then
okay
if you wanted them both to come then you would have put that down on the list
yeah
and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information
yeah
yeah
so then
to send back to those other people
im kind of in control over who comes just from my family
right
because once it went to the oldest people then they knew who they wanted to invite
yeah
then they sent their little things to us
yeah
okay
it was up to me whether i wanted my kids and any of my family to come
uh-huh
right
right
i see
so
i see
thats a pretty good idea to do it that way
and then it never did
if i didnt want somebody to come then i just wouldnt send them $unc$one of the questionnaires
uh-huh
so there really wasnt a problem that way
right
right
right
thats a real good idea
yeah
but i tell you what thats the neatest book weve got
i bet
course weve still got it
and they charged us i think like it was like $unc$five or $unc$six dollars i cant remember exactly that we paid for the book to be printed
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and its not a hard back book its just a folder type thing
uh-huh
but it has the entire
it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldnt
how neat
yeah
i know thats really neat
thats really neat
and it will be something my kids will have
just
i was just thinking of what you could tell your kids
yeah
because if you stop and think
i dont know if youre like me
but i know very little about before my grandparents
uh-huh
uh-huh
very little about it
i just
the thing is i know a lot of stories
but i cant remember who it was about
my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult
they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends cause they all grew up in $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city
but i remember these stories
but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories
yeah
so i couldnt give an accurate
i couldnt tell my kids what those people were like
i just remember they had some funny stories
but i dont know who it was
maybe what you could do if you couldnt get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some
uh-huh
but then usually when you find out some information from your parents then you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these
yeah
okay
all right
what kind of camping is there in $unc$texas
there are quite a few i guess state parks
and theres a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
uh-huh
most of them have pretty good facilities
i dont know if the camping that ive done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff
yeah
you do backpacking and the like
done a little bit of that mainly just camping out at the state parks
ive been to a couple in $unc$texas
and theres some real nice ones in $unc$arkansas
uh-huh
i think $unc$arkansas has $unc$one of the best parks departments around
huh
is the $unc$ozarks in $unc$arkansas
uh-huh
yeah
part of them are
yeah
so thats probably a pretty nice place to go
yeah
theyve got real nice lake system around their parks
$unc$one of them the gray i think thats $unc$one of the ones weve been to its real nice there a bunch of lakes around it
theres a golf course and just a whole bunch of camping sites
yeah
what about you
where have you
ive been camping for years not on a regular basis
but i first started camping out in the desert in $unc$california and then sometimes in the mountains also in $unc$california
uh-huh
and then i moved to $unc$north $unc$carolina
and i didnt camp for a long time
and then i started to go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting
so id go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
uh-huh
and then maybe camp another night and drive home
and that was pretty good
so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
and i still do it once in a while
yeah
i think weve collected stuff off and on over the years
the more times we did it the more serious we get about it
uh-huh
yeah
where is $unc$raleigh in $unc$north $unc$carolina
in terms of north south i would say its a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
okay
so what i-
are you kind of away from the $unc$blue $unc$ridge $unc$mountains
its
an area
actually the $unc$blue $unc$ridge in $unc$virginia are closer to $unc$raleigh
theyre about $unc$three hours away if you go due north
uh-huh
of
the $unc$blue $unc$ridge in $unc$north $unc$carolina i think are much nicer
and you can pick those up going west
but then youre talking about $unc$six to $unc$eight hours
yeah
the way it works
but its a real nice place to go and camp
and theres some pretty decent campgrounds although i dont think the state of $unc$north $unc$carolina takes
they probably just dont spend as much money as a lot of other states might
uh-huh
yeah
my wifes from the western part of $unc$virginia
weve been down the parkway a lot
but i didnt know how much camping areas there were along there
i think theres quite a few
i cant say ive checked them all out though
whats it like camping in the desert and $unc$california
that seems like a challenge
its kind of incredible
its really really nice
i like it better than almost anything ive ever done
just the sky is so amazing
you really can probably count thousands of stars
uh-huh
and its just kind of nice
i like the
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which a lot of people dont realize
they hear desert
and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water
course it has all of those qualities
but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just dont find anyway else except in a desert
uh-huh
so its pretty nice
the movie the $unc$doors has some nice desert scenes
those guys all go camping out in the desert
yeah
of course they drag a lot of drugs with them
but the shots are pretty nice
and its sort of like that
its just almost surreal in some places
its very pleasant
are the temperatures real extreme there
or the
they can be
yeah
you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know whats going to happen
uh-huh
ive been camping in $unc$death $unc$valley
one doesnt go in $unc$july
yeah
true
but its beautiful in $unc$february
yeah
its just beautiful
the days get up into the high eighties maybe the nineties
but its quite bearable
and then the nights are reasonably warm sixties or seventies
its just great
its really very nice
yeah
weve talked about planning a trip up through
i have a sister-in-law that lives up through $unc$new $unc$mexico and into $unc$colorado and the $unc$grand $unc$canyon area
i dont know when im going to get a chance to do that
but
yeah
that would be pretty nice
i have been camping on the south rim the $unc$grand $unc$canyon
thats okay
a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside
i was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking especially with my gear
uh-huh
ill bet
that $unc$one thing you said about the stars is really true
its
when youre close to a big city like $unc$dallas the lights kind of wash off the star
yeah
so its nice to get away
its just amazing how much you miss
yeah
it
yeah
it
yeah
it really is
i dont think i ever see the $unc$little $unc$dipper
you hear people talk about the $unc$little $unc$dipper
uh-huh
but i dont think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in the mountains
otherwise its just too faint
i guess weve talked as much as we need to on the subject
yeah
i think we fulfilled our obligation
thanks for calling
nice talking to you
yeah
it was good talking to you $unc$robert
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
$unc$stephanie whats your position on gun control
on a scale of $unc$one to $unc$ten being $unc$ten no kind of legislation and zero being total ban i probably would lean more towards $unc$six or $unc$seven
i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
uh-huh
i lived in $unc$massachusetts for $unc$two years
and they have a total ban on guns
and i saw that it didnt stop crime in that state
was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
any kind of firearms
really
yeah
its
theres was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught with a firearm
and also i think there was a fine
and that didnt help at all
no
i dont
the crime is not any better or any worse
its
i shouldnt say i dont know if it was any worse
but it certainly didnt get any better
uh-huh
i usually just
im trying to think of
i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the $unc$three where i dont think you should necessarily ban guns by any means
uh-huh
but you should definitely have the character search and the $unc$seven day holding period and things along that nature
you shouldnt be able to go out there and just buy $unc$one right off the shelf
yeah
i agree with that
but
i think that the law on who can buy a gun are way too lax
uh-huh
exactly
i think that the
and so i think that kind of control would be good
yeah
but the
im trying to think of how many times you make the statement just to kind of exam it a little bit
and i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals
but how many times
i guess i have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person whos being robbed had a gun
i
and maybe they just dont report those
or im not sure
or i cant think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed
but good thing they had their gun on them
and they thwarted the robbery attempt
yeah
im not really sure
personally i dont own a gun
uh-huh
and i dont think i probably ever would although i would like to know how to handle $unc$one
and i think everybody should learn how to handle $unc$one
uh-huh
you just never know when you might come into contact with $unc$one
true
were you brought up in a family that hunted
or
no
nobody in my family hunted
my father had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in $unc$massachusetts
we lived in $unc$new $unc$hampshire at the time
how about that
and he lived in $unc$massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
so we ended up with these guns
uh-huh
and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
jeez
and so that was really the only experience that ive had with guns
and it kind of scared me
right
uh-huh
but i think that if i learn how to use one i would feel better
right
ive also always thought about the idea most sports which are the $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a and people have their thing
if you ban guns youre just banning the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature
most of thats done with rifles and such though theres probably im sure some sector that does it with handguns
but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous
you couldnt be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that
yeah
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately
if they had to have a rifle or was
made it more difficult to get a handgun
of course in this world anytime youve freedom you can be able to get anything you want
yeah
thats true
but i guess to make it more difficult for the person whos just so irate and upset and temporarily a little bit offset or off keel
i dont know if thats a large percentage of crime or not
but i guess it would be some
but i think definitely
today they just introduced whats called the $unc$brady bill the $unc$seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns
uh-huh
and i think shoot thats a good idea
i would definitely support that
yeah
i agree the thing that scares me though about where i would definitely want some sort of legislation
and coming from the north east im just not used to seeing these
and i know this may sound kind of stereo typical
but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks thats kind of scary to me
sure
to me it is more like vigilantism
uh-huh
and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in $unc$l $unc$a on the freeways
right
yeah
thats crazy
and then you come here in the $unc$dallas area
i dont believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles especially not in the back window for everybody to see
yeah
thats kind of wild
uh-huh
that is kind of wild
thats all very interesting
thanks for talking
youre welcome
good-bye
okay
bye-bye
there we go
right
im a $unc$dodgers fan from way back
how way back
late fifties early sixties
okay
so $unc$wally $unc$moon moon shots and all that
whats that
yeah
coliseum $unc$wally $unc$moon and all that
yeah
okay
yeah
its a
im living just west of $unc$baltimore and $unc$frederick which is also just west of $unc$baltimore has a minor league team
and $unc$wally $unc$moon is the manager of them
is that right
yeah
so hes still kicking around
thats interesting
yeah
i also lived $unc$eight years in $unc$ohio before going away to college
and i used to go watch the $unc$toledo $unc$mudhens
i saw them
i was out there last summer
and i saw a game at $unc$ned $unc$skelton
is that the stadium
i couldnt tell you for sure
its been a long time
okay
so there used to be a race track
uh-huh
yeah
it was
that was impression i got when i was there
so
yeah
i think thats right
okay
yeah
so had a lot of fun
i like minor league baseball a lot
its cheaper for $unc$one thing
thats true
i think ive kind of become a $unc$rangers fan over the last $unc$eleven years since ive been here
theyve led the $unc$american league in batting fielding and pitching
but theyve never been able to do more than $unc$one of those in any given year
so
yes
i think theyre in for a odd year this year
they
i dont understand why $unc$encovilla got released
i dont either
the guys $unc$twenty $unc$twenty-five home rums maybe $unc$thirty $unc$eighty some r b i-s
he cant field
and he strikes out a lot
but hes done that for $unc$five years
why get rid of him now
he really has become a very decent fielder
yes
okay
hes not the liability that he used to be
okay
he fits right in with $unc$detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot
yeah
of course get a guy like $unc$cecil $unc$fielder
if he strikes out a lot so what
yeah
with $unc$detroit they can get away with $unc$one guy like that
if i were in $unc$detroit i would start building the team around $unc$fielder
yeah
but that doesnt mean get $unc$three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out which they did
right
yep
i think the key for $unc$l $unc$a this year is whether $unc$oral $unc$herschiser can come back
i think the pitchings deep enough that it doesnt matter
it may be
i like them a lot
i think theyre going to go all the way
and by saying i like them i like their chances
i actually dont like the $unc$dodgers
im a $unc$giants fan from way back
right
right
picking up $unc$darrell $unc$strawberry didnt hurt
no
but $unc$butler didnt hurt either
and $unc$bobby $unc$ojeda didnt hurt
and
whos the last one
$unc$bobby $unc$ojeda
they got him from the $unc$mets for $unc$hubie $unc$brooks
okay
hes a pretty decent pitcher
hes
yes he is
okay
he
yes
and that guy the short stop is going to be good
yeah
it should be an interesting year
yeah
im looking
ive already been to $unc$one game
and i should have been to $unc$two
but
are you an $unc$orioles fan
the team i live and die with is the $unc$red $unc$sox mostly die
but i go to the $unc$orioles since theyre here
and i do enjoy them
yeah
ive had an opening day on $unc$monday
yeah
i kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the $unc$national $unc$league teams here once in a while
how far is $unc$houston
$unc$three $unc$hundred miles
okay
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes
yeah
its incredible
yeah
i
were pretty lucky because if i want to see a $unc$national $unc$league team i can usually go up to $unc$philadelphia
there you go
and saw the $unc$cardinals and $unc$cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
boy you are a baseball fan arent you
okay
yeah
interesting
i try to see whatever i can
ive been to $unc$thirty or $unc$forty games each of the last few years
wow
yeah
hope im going to do it this year because having a kid this fall
so its like so much for going to lots of baseball games
all right
so do it while you can
yeah
seriously
sure
its been good talking with you
yeah
good talking with you
and youll be happy i think in $unc$october when the $unc$dodgers win
i wouldnt mind it
yeah
ill be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
yeah
$unc$god bless
and good talking with you
and good talking with you
take care
bye-bye
bye
do you want to start
g-
yeah
im trying to think what ive seen lately
we-
we just finished watching teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape
did you watch dances with wolves
did you see the movie
yeah
weve seen that
yeah
did you like it
yeah
it was great
have you seen it
i thought it was very well done
yeah
i
how about ghost
we saw an we liked it
but i didnt think it was as good as all the hype was about it
right
i feel the same way about that too
it was okay
yeah
i don-
i couldnt see it worth getting a nomination for best picture
no
no
and wh-
lets see
the most recent ones that ive seen are those $unc$two ghost and dances with wolves
but i rent videos
do you
yeah
yeah
and so we just
you watch many
it depends on wh-
do you like the classics like gone with the wind and the older movies
id like to see those
theres like $unc$three movies that i keep telling myself that i should see some day that i havent seen that are classics
because ive never seen $unc$citizen $unc$kane
yeah
that was good
and ive never seen $unc$casablanca and never seen gone with the wind
i think ive seen most of $unc$humphrey bogarts movies but in a long time ago
uh-huh
and the maltese falcon and all those
i def-
we saw part of the african queen on t v a couple of years ago
yeah
that was good
yeah
and ive been wanting to see all of it
but we walk into the video store
and were like why dont we go see this now
so
yeah
yeah
its true
but i think-
$unc$one of the movies we saw recently we saw misery
i didnt see that one
that was good
really
it was great
and it
you think because it was by $unc$stephen $unc$king it would be really gory
but theres only $unc$one
theres a couple scenes at the end there is some blood and everything
and theres $unc$one really bad scene where theres not blood but its pretty graphic
yeah
but its a really good movie
really
is that the one where the guy gets captured by that women
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
hes a writer
and shes his biggest fan
and shes also a little on the nutso side
yeah
right
uh-huh
did you see pacific heights
no
we havent
i saw that one
that $unc$one wasnt that great either
it wasnt
i didnt think so
no
oka-
i got
i heard mixed reviews of that
we s-
how about silence of the lambs
thats on our list of things to see
i know
i wanted to see
i was curious if you had seen it
and that
n-
our big thing is
movie prices up here
i think its like $unc$six bucks now in the theaters
yeah
so its like
a lot of things we try to catch at the dollar theater or matinees
and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape
thats us too
yeah
yeah
true
i know its too bad that theyve gotten so expensive
ye-
$unc$one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was $unc$edward $unc$scissorhands
really
yeah
have you seen that
no
it was great
really
yeah
it was
i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than ad-
no
no
its an odd film
and its really interesting that
i like the director a lot a guy named $unc$tim $unc$burton
uh-huh
did you ever see the movie $unc$beetlejuice
part of it
i never really watched the whole thing
ok-
se-
yeah
if you liked $unc$beetlejuice youll probably like $unc$edward $unc$scissorhands
if you didnt like $unc$beetlejuice youll probably wont like $unc$edward $unc$scissorhands
really
yeah
its
burtons kind of e-
hes a very odd man
but hes
i think hes very interesting
and i liked those $unc$two movies of his a lot
uh-huh
he did $unc$batman also which
yeah
that was pretty good though
it was good
but he was
when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies
yeah
you see it for a couple of hours or an hour
and it really
theres a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that
yeah
yeah
whose your favorite actress or actor
dont really know
i like $unc$costner a lot
but im a big baseball fan
uh-huh
so after $unc$bull $unc$durham and field of dreams
yeah
although
that was good
i saw that movie too
that was very good
which $unc$one
field of dreams
yeah
field of dreams was good
and i think i liked the other movies hes done
no way out was really good
and
yeah
yeah
did you ever see $unc$silverado
$unc$silverado
who was that with
lets see
$unc$danny $unc$glover $unc$scott $unc$glen $unc$kevin $unc$kline $unc$brian $unc$dennehy $unc$jeff goldblums in
$unc$john $unc$kreas is in it if you dont blink
that
the title sounds familiar
im trying to thi-
it was a big western
i think $unc$roseanne $unc$arquett was in it too another one that if you blink youd miss her
it was
and i think it was a $unc$three hour movie or $unc$two and a half hours
and it was $unc$one of those ones that could have been $unc$four hours if they hadnt cut a lot out
really
but it was really good
i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i would remember i think with him in it
uh-huh
how about revenge
did you see that with him
no
i didnt
is that any good
with $unc$anthony $unc$quinn
i thought it was
i like everything hes done so far
okay
its $unc$one of those movies that its not a great movie
but it was okay
yeah
we were in the video store today
and somebody was recommending it to somebody
the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else
yeah
it was not a bad movie
ill have to catch it $unc$one of these days
you sa-
you said you seen no way out
yeah
that was excellent
yeah
that was very good
he was in the untouchables too
thats another one i wanted to see
tha-
in fact that was advertised not too long ago
yeah
it was on
cable
no
it was on $unc$one of the networks i think last weekend or $unc$two weeks ago
okay
i know i saw something about it
yeah
i wish id seen it when it was originally in the theaters
and i saw part of it again
uh-huh
i like $unc$costner
i like $unc$sean $unc$connery
and theres this $unc$one actor
its really silly that i enjoy him a lot
but ive really enjoyed him in everything ive seen him in a guy named $unc$charles $unc$martin $unc$smith
i dont know him
youve probably seen him
and just an
thats who the guy is
do you remember
did you ever see american graffiti
no
i dont think so
oh
did you ever see the movie star man
yes
okay
in star man he was the guy chasing after $unc$jeff $unc$bridges and or $unc$nancy $unc$allen
okay
okay
w-
short nerdy guy with glasses
yeah
yeah
hes just
i dont know why but hes always a lot of fun in every movie hes in
he was in the untouchables
he was the accountant
i know who you mean
yeah
he was in honey dont shrink the kids wasnt he
no
no
youre thinking of $unc$rick $unc$moranis
he looks like $unc$rick $unc$moranis
but hes not
okay
se-
all right
yeah
thats the one i was thinking of
but ive seen quite a few movies
i enjoy them
i think that its kind of good entertainment an escape type of thing
yeah
yeah
how about some of the ads
do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews
do they influence you a lot
a little of
e-
e-
a review usually wont make me go see a movie i hadnt already wanted to see
yeah
did you see goodfellas
no
its o-
i want to see it
that was pretty good
and
we want to see godfather part $unc$three also
but my girlfriends seen part $unc$one and part $unc$two although she saw them years ago
uh-huh
but ive never seen either of the godfather movies
so were probably going to rent those some time and then try to see godfather part $unc$three somewhere
i was just going to say you should see those first if you can
yeah
if you read the book its even better
the book was excellent
okay
i havent never read it
yeah
and i was a little disappointed in the third on-
its godfather $unc$three
it was not bad
but i expected more i think
uh-huh
we just rented a couple weeks ago a movie called the freshman
with
its got $unc$matthew $unc$broderick in it and $unc$marlon $unc$brando
and $unc$brando does a parody of the character he played in the godfather
really
yeah
its $unc$one of the reasons why the godfathers been on our minds lately
but theres a bunch of scenes from the godfather thats used because $unc$matthew brodericks going to film school
and in his classes theyre running a bunch of scenes from the godfather
and then hes running into $unc$marlon $unc$brando who is playing this organized crime head
uh-huh
so it was a fun movie
or
i liked $unc$rainman
i thought it was interesting that he was doing som-
yeah
that was good
i liked $unc$rainman too
yeah
im
being from $unc$baltimore of course im a big $unc$barry $unc$levinson fan since hes done a bunch of $unc$baltimore movies
uh-huh
n-
$unc$barry $unc$levinson did diner and tinman and $unc$avalon which are all set in $unc$baltimore
yeah
they sound familiar
i probably saw parts of those
a lot of times ill start watching a movie
and im tired
and it
uh-huh
next thing you know its
especially if theres commercial in it
ye-
we-
and then the titles might sound familiar
but i really dont know what theyre all about
ye-
of the $unc$three of those diners probably the best
theyre all pretty good
but diner is really worth seeing
is that the $unc$one set in the fifties or sixties
late fifties
yeah
late fifties
yeah
i think i saw that one
okay
and
how about $unc$meryl $unc$streep
i dont know
im not a real great football follower
i guess there are $unc$two basic teams that i seem to follow every year
$unc$one is the $unc$dallas $unc$cowboys
and the other is the $unc$oklahoma $unc$sooners
okay
being a native $unc$okie i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing
i see
so you make it to that $unc$longhorns $unc$sooners game
no
every year
no
its funny
i got out and got my bachelors degree in $unc$seventy-three and never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
how about that
but i always enjoyed watching them
i just
growing up in $unc$oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like $unc$dallas is around here
yeah
yeah
and theres always been an interest there
its kind of same for me
i grew up in southern $unc$new $unc$jersey
and the local team was $unc$philadelphia
yeah
and they were $unc$thirty miles right up the river
and im still pretty much an $unc$eagle fan i guess
i guess you keep those things you grew up with
i worked in $unc$missouri for a while
and i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the $unc$cowboys were playing the $unc$saint $unc$louis $unc$cardinals
and i was rooting for the $unc$cowboys
yeah
but they were kind of closer to home when i struck up with them
i really dont know whats going to take place with the $unc$cowboys this year
everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction theyre going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year
in a way that happened this past season
and i think thats quite a bit of optimism around here that still theres a chance that maybe these guys are right maybe they will come through and do something this year
i look for it to be a pretty good year
boy they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
they did
they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we werent familiar with
some of them turned out to be pretty good players
some of them didnt
and maybe the stuff that $unc$jerry $unc$jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off
at least we hope it will
yeah
i keep waiting for the $unc$eagles to get over the hump
they make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there
and theyve got a lot of the tools to do it
but if they cant just put it together
they have got the quarterback there in $unc$randal $unc$cunningham whos just phenomenal
but hes too streaky it seems
yeah
but they have always been a really strong team
yeah
yeah
and without a whole lot of big name players
they have got a few anchors on offense and defense
and theyve managed with those guys
and i dont know
once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it
i guess yeah
thats the typical trait of the $unc$dallas $unc$cowboys and the $unc$oklahoma $unc$sooners
yeah
its funny over the years
i guess since $unc$staubach left they havent been able to keep it going
its been a rough road to hoe ever since he left
i dont know why its so hard to find a good quarterback these days
that says a lot for his ability though i think for staubachs
yeah
he was $unc$one of the few who come through in history that can really perform
we hope
every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through
in a way $unc$aikman has done some of that
but the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
yeah
i tell you its difficult in that guys position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things
yeah
they did
they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside
its funny watching them play
hes probably like a lot of quarterbacks
when the pressure is really on when its down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
uh-huh
and i havent quite figured that out
if they figure they have got it won or if theres no real hurry because the first $unc$three quarters or if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
yeah
so i dont know
im looking for a good year
i guess were always looking for a good year
obviously though do you think theyre going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the $unc$super $unc$bowl this year
or who do you like to do that this year
no
i dont think the $unc$cowboys have got a chance
i think they will probably win $unc$one or $unc$two more games than they did this year
and theyll get close to it
theyll probably get everybodys hopes up and blow it toward the end
so whos going to beat them
who are they going to blow it to
thats a good question
im figuring either the eagles or possibly $unc$san $unc$francisco
im not real sure
boy theyd some big changes speaking of them
they did
so i dont know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation
and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
yeah
im sure my sentimental favorite would have to be $unc$philadelphia
but i sure am scared of them $unc$giants
thats true
those guys are tough
they are tough
and theyre big
theyre mean
and they are going to come right through you if you dont do something
yeah
that sure was a fun $unc$super $unc$bowl to watch this year
yeah
yeah
i wasnt pulling for either team
no
no
but that was just a good football game
and its funny
you like to pull for the underdog
and for a long time i was pulling for $unc$denver
uh-huh
$unc$marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does
but hes a good quarterback
hes got a good arm
sometimes its too good because he throws too hard
$unc$l $unc$a you mean
$unc$l $unc$a
sorry
boy speaking of $unc$denver on another subject ive been up there $unc$five times in the last $unc$three $unc$four weeks
yeah
yeah
weve been trying get this new d n b $unc$two $unc$thousand printer up and running
has it been snowing up there
i was just up there
i just got back last night around $unc$eleven $unc$thirty or so
and it was about $unc$seven inches of snow on the ground
wow
and it snowed all day
that will make the skiers happy
yeah
yeah
if
it snowed that much in $unc$denver
they got that much up in the mountains just west of there
you bet
yeah
up around the $unc$keystone and $unc$copper $unc$mountain those guys will love that
good to talk to you
yeah
enjoyed it $unc$bob
you guys have a good time keep those printers coming
hey
well do it
all right
bye
bye
go ahead
okay
do i still feel that the $unc$soviet $unc$union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world
absolutely
and my reasons are based upon not only what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things i ran into during my $unc$six years as a soldier in the $unc$fifth $unc$special $unc$forces $unc$group
okay
i guess i dont see them as much of a threat as they used to be
but i think just the instability of the country right now is sort of scary
thats what makes it a powder keg
the
ill go back in time a little bit to about $unc$eighty-one when my first real involvement with the military started
uh-huh
naturally we were at the time
the $unc$soviet $unc$union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat
so we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on $unc$soviet tactics and weapons
uh-huh
i went to $unc$lebanon in $unc$eighty-three before the marines ever got there with the $unc$u $unc$n $unc$peace $unc$keeping $unc$force with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
these werent $unc$chinese made copies
these were $unc$soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box $unc$a $unc$k forty-sevens as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
uh-huh
in $unc$granada in $unc$october twenty-fifth $unc$eighty-three we invaded the place
sure there were $unc$cuban soldiers there
but there was also a bunch of $unc$russian advisors that were damn good shots
the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on $unc$point $unc$salinas
and for every $unc$cuban there was at least $unc$five $unc$russian advisors
and they were all shooting state of the art $unc$soviet weapons
in $unc$eighty-four i was down in $unc$central $unc$america as an advisor to the $unc$honduran $unc$army
again we were running up against $unc$cubans quite a bit plus $unc$soviet advisors
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the $unc$nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate $unc$soviet made material
do i consider them a threat
absolutely
they have a university in $unc$moscow called the $unc$patrice de $unc$lamumba $unc$university
about like $unc$a and $unc$m or $unc$u $unc$t where theyre teachings subjects like that theyre teaching terrorism
some of the people we went up against in $unc$lebanon were graduates from that place
and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
im surprised during this iraqi crisis we didnt have more incidents than they did
these guys are top of the line
when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
and they are very very good at what they do
so until i see the entire quote old guard of the $unc$soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried i still consider them a threat
uh-huh
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops
that
irregardless of what $unc$soviet policy is theyre going to do what the general tells them
yeah
i guess thats what concerns me the most is theyre so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people
its interesting watching the different $unc$soviet states $unc$albania $unc$lithuania doing their little revolts down there
uh-huh
each $unc$one of those sectors has got a $unc$soviet general over the troops that are there
so far they havent run into the real psychos yet
theres probably $unc$five or $unc$six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these $unc$soviet states
if uprisings happen in their sectors its going to be a total blood bath
yeah
it looks like its come close to that as it is
theyre showing remarkable restraint
they get real nasty the $unc$hyundee helicopters come out
and they would level entire areas
okay
youre from the $unc$dallas area right
uh-huh
okay
basically the size of the area around $unc$richardson
yeah
you put $unc$five $unc$soviet $unc$hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area
and there wont be anything left alive
and they can do that in about $unc$four minutes
and theyve got entire squadrons of those just standing by
they used them in $unc$afghanistan did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
but on a highly populated area like some of the $unc$soviet cities would be with the weaponry thats attached on those things there is no place to hide
if the bombs dont get you if the bullets dont get you then the nerve gas definitely will get you
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got $unc$five minutes of air time
they drink that much fuel
uh-huh
were you
have you
i take it you havent spent any time in the military
no
i havent
as a civilian thats never been attached to any form of the military
i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers
uh-huh
but during that same time frame didnt you get some feeling that theyre getting all these weapons and stuff
didnt it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff
you mean in the most recent conflict
in any of them since $unc$eighty-one
yeah
definitely
im a little bit shocked to what the $unc$u $unc$s has done in terms of selling to $unc$iraq in the past $unc$ten to $unc$fifteen years
yeah
i think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too
its bad enough that the $unc$soviets do it
it all boils down to whether its our side their side
its a matter of money to a certain extent
uh-huh
the deal the $unc$iraqis have with the $unc$russians was for oil
yeah
its scary to know that theyre supplying that many people with weapons especially when its to the south of us
the ones to the south are more regional conflict
theyre not really that worried about invading north
theyre more interested in
theyve got a screwed up situation ill give them that from $unc$mexico all the way down into $unc$central and $unc$south $unc$america
the situation down there is weird
and its very screwed up
uh-huh
inflation is out of this world
and the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
and generally the people are getting screwed
and theyre tired of it
and theyre willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
yeah
i think $unc$russia is getting to the point where theyre about to do something to get out of communism
i guess id would like to see somebody like $unc$yeltsin to get more power
i think $unc$gorbachev has about had his day
unfortunately yeltsins got too many connections with the old guard
thats the only drawback that i see with the entire thing
yeah
$unc$gorbachev has made his attempt
and hes had his problems with some of the old guard himself
uh-huh
yeltsins in tight with the old guard
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of $unc$two evils at this point
uh-huh
true
i dont know
i sure wouldnt turn my back on them
you mean
i understand when they reduced the number of troops in $unc$europe after the $unc$berlin $unc$wall went down
i thought that was great
but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out
uh-huh
it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there
but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if its a regional conflict
if $unc$united $unc$states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it talk the talk but its got to be able to walk the walk
its got to have the stuff to back up what its saying
if youve only got a token force there you cant hold your ground
at least theyre learning a little bit from history
so this is an appropriate topic the day after $unc$earth $unc$day
so
right
what do you think is the main pollutants in the air
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i think they put off so much
and theyre not regulated enough
yeah
thats me too
after
on channel $unc$thirteen they had some programs the day before
and im not sure that about yesterday we didnt really watch it too much yesterday
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and how were affecting the $unc$earth and things by what we do as the people
uh-huh
and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot
yeah
and that actually as our population increases and our number of cars increase per the population thats the problem but also like you said the industry pollution
and their regulation thats placed on them its better than it used to be
but its incredible that theyre not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
right
i just
i cant stand that
and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that
theyre supposed to be regulated because i dont know about $unc$t $unc$i but we have a $unc$pillsbury plant in a town adjacent to ours
uh-huh
and i know people that work there that
of course you wouldnt think $unc$pillsbury would put out certain chemicals
no
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do to make their dough and to clean out the flour and stuff like that
really
yeah
its incredible
and they said that they have a little creek that runs by them
and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they shut down everything
and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that theyre dumping things that theyre not supposed to be dumping
oh
and im like if theyre getting away with it can you imagine
right
thats a $unc$pillsbury plant
i cant imagine plants
i wouldnt have thought that $unc$pillsbury even had chem-
those chemicals would not
yeah
they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff to break the flours down
yeah
and then they also do testing there
and i dont
when you consider its probably not radioactive
but toxic can be anything thats classified that can damage the $unc$earth
right
yeah
so there could be a lot of things that they could put chemical wise that they use to that they are testing with that theyre dumping
right
like in packaging
yeah
and just goodness
yeah
i dont think they do the packaging at this plant
yeah
but they do a lot of research
and they do a lot of the refining up there
or
yeah
im not really
whats it called when you do flour
im not
only thing i can think is bleaching
but i dont know how they do the flour
yeah
yeah
but were on the southwest side of $unc$houston
we dont have that much as far as aiming in the plants over on this the east side does
uh-huh
weve got $unc$imperial sugar
and theyre right there on the creek also
and theyve been there for years
yeah
and
but
you think about it
its probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just
im not really sure
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream or such
yeah
or you can do testing on the ground itself at that point
uh-huh
but when they pollute into the air and youve got movement through the air its going to move a lot of that off
so i dont see how they can do some of the te-
unless it just hangs there like in places where its a lot of pollution like in $unc$los $unc$angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there
uh-huh
you know that you have a lot more particles in the air particles in the surrounding community because its not moved away
right
yeah
uh-huh
but
i know that
i worry every now and then
were still on a well water
were not on city water
uh-huh
and i think what if somebodys dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and it sinked in through the ground and all that
yeah
i know out in some
im not sure
i cant remember the name of the county
its where $unc$stillwater is or sweet
yeah
no
im not sure
i know it
i think its
i know we have a piece property there
its called $unc$dublin
uh-huh
its in $unc$dublin $unc$texas
im not really sure what the county
its $unc$stephen
no
$unc$stephenville
okay
okay
okay
where stephenvilles at theyve had a lot of problems because theyve introduced a lot of dairies there
uh-huh
yeah
so they have a lot of cattle in the area
per lot theyve got a lot of head of cattle because dairies its not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free
right
uh-huh
theyve got to have them there to be able to milk them
and they
and i read in this article i couldnt believe it where $unc$one cow a day produces like a $unc$hundred or so pounds of manure
oh
$unc$one cow
i was like my $unc$god
and they
and this thing says that people think cow manure is good for fertilizer
but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because its not
when you buy cow manure at the store theyve added stuff to it
and theyve added humus and stuff that breaks it down
uh-huh
and this article said that theyve got a real problem that youve got toxins and bacteria in the manure that is
what its doing is its going through
they dont have a very deep o-
their natural water
uh-huh
i forget what thats called with
its a spring water
yeah
but its below the surface
its not very far down
uh-huh
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water
oh
and theyre afraid that within a certain amount of years their water in that town will be totally polluted
it will
and they wont be able to have any drinking water because they will have completely polluted so that theres too many toxins and bacterial growth
uh-huh
yeah
and the gr-
and im like my $unc$god just from them introducing dairy farms in that $unc$one county
right
right
yeah
and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it
no
not when you figure
i didnt realize $unc$one cow produces that much manure
and they were talking thousands cows in $unc$one little tiny area
these are well fed
these are
you
good grief these are well fed cows
they are evidently
but evidently a normal cow produces that much too
uh-huh
but theyre just so spread out on ranches and stuff that its not a problem
right
but when they get them in these tiny little areas theyve got a real big problem
and they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to these ponds that they had to filter it with
uh-huh
but the ponds because theyve had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow
yeah
and they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area
so that just creates
theres
and it was just disgusting
it said the creeks will foam
oh
people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all
thats bad
and im just like my gosh
and the smell is really bad they sa-
i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a $unc$hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad
yeah
but i dont know
it really frightens me though as far as thinking of just air pollution itself
and channel $unc$thirteen theyre really emphasizing the problem with acid rain
uh-huh
if we keep putting that stuff into the air and if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it its really going to be a problem for what the $unc$earth is receiving back because how can you tell where its going to come down at
yeah
right
right
and then cutting the trees that bothers me
yeah
as far as the
the rain forest and all
yes
weve been wanting to
not me
but its been suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here
im like no
for whats cut down here more will be cut down someplace else
and it will just take that longer to grow back
yeah
and trees help so that
i dont
they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we cant synthesize it
uh-huh
and theyre synthesizing it for us
right
right
believe me its just so much better
yeah
so yeah
i knew
i think theres lots that could be done to improve how things are done now
yeah
i think we just have to
i dont know personally
i suppose if you just make sure your car is working properly
uh-huh
and yo-
theyre suppos-
nowadays they have the emission controls on them
but i think the main thing is just keep on your legislators back as far as
seems like theyve only just really started as far as the environment saying okay were really going to get involved
uh-huh
its really becoming a problem
by the year $unc$two $unc$thousand there will
what are we going to have
what kind of results are we going to have for the environment
right
and what will we
huh
okay
i dont know how much i know about this subject
i dont know if i know anything or not
yeah
but ive got some opinions on it
okay
go ahead
those type of people that have the most opinions ones that dont know anything
yeah
ive had teenagers
and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers
and i dont know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
i think this me generation has gone far too far
and the young people are overly impressed
and i think it wouldnt hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint
thats true
i personally know nothing about the $unc$peace $unc$corps though
me either
i went to college and then started working and then got married
and
but they have
i read somewhere
and im out on a limb here some type of college volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college
and they do $unc$one year of volunteer work teaching in the lower income brackets of the $unc$united $unc$states
have you ever heard about that $unc$one
no
i havent
i know that my sister
i have a twin sister
and when they graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south $unc$texas
and i know that if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they dont pay as much they cancel part of your college note or whatever
really
uh-huh
if its really a lower paying job where in a small town obviously you dont need as much as far as to live
and this is money that shes borrowed to form her college education
yeah
she only taught there $unc$one year
but i
but she got credits for it
uh-huh
thats very interesting
and i think it would be
i know that also $unc$one of my cousins who he is in the therapy type thing
and he was
some group paid part of his college income
but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at
its a nursing home or something like that
huh
so if
i think thats a good way maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
yeah
i think that is an excellent program
i really do
i like that
and its beneficial to the small towns too because they really have a disadvantage that we wouldnt understand because were in the $unc$metroplex
yeah
as far as getting doctors and all that stuff yeah
right
if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find $unc$one it wouldnt be convenient
yeah
but we could find $unc$one
uh-huh
we wouldnt have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
yeah
so i can see the advantage to that $unc$one
the $unc$peace $unc$corps itself is really dying out isnt it
i really dont know that much about it
i think of the $unc$peace $unc$corps more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when
its still in existence
yeah
and dont they go into other countries and stuff
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm dig their own wells set up their schools
uh-huh
things that make the
yeah
make them more self-supporting
yes
they
yeah
its not a program to teach them to use the american money its a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
right
yeah
and yes
youre right
i think its a sixties program
i think it was $unc$one of kennedys hot points that he
that was his big deal
but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what its like if you dont have all the money and cant have what you want when you want it
right
right
i think ive singled out my grandchildren
but theyre pretty good along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other peoples children and grandchildren mine arent really that bad
uh-huh
but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
yeah
but theres a
i dont know that you could require everyone to do it for a whole year or $unc$two years or something like that
mandatory just like the draft
no
i dont know that that would work if somebodys didnt really want to be there and didnt have
every time you
they could buy their way out
yeah
there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
right
theyd figure a way around that $unc$one in a heartbeat
but im wondering if theres another issue here
and maybe this is why this has died out
can you go into
and this wasnt the question
but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
can they go in there and can anyone go out of
the kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time
but i think $unc$bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation
and teach them to farm and teach them
and it doesnt do any good
yeah
i dont know that it does
i dont know that if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
yeah
were losing certain races of people
uh-huh
there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete
uh-huh
and im just wondering if youre fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out
theres a german word for it thats elegant
but i never can remember what it was
but theyre being winnowed because where they are theyre not adapted to their environment essentially
right
yeah
and $unc$one of the quick examples is the $unc$aborigines
yeah
uh-huh
when we were in $unc$australia
sad little things i felt sorry for them because their society isnt there anymore
and their belief system and all the structures of their society are gone essentially
yeah
and theyre just kind of more like a side show than anything else
and thats sad
yeah
but i dont think theres any way the $unc$peace $unc$corps could go in and rescue those people
and i dont think you could have done it $unc$fifty or a $unc$hundred years ago either
yeah
so im wondering if the $unc$peace $unc$corps is really an effective tool
down here with the $unc$peace $unc$corps were talking about all these people that arent even in our own country when theres enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped
good point
weve got enough without a passport
theres plenty
yeah
yes
i think we ought to worry about our own species
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join the $unc$peace $unc$corps for a year maybe during college maybe have some kind of course where theyd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the $unc$united $unc$states
i wonder now in
and ive been out of school too long to answer this
but i wonder if there arent some sociology courses
there probably are
for
but im sure
thats probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff
but i think that it wouldnt really be half bad for everybody not to do something and realize its everybodys responsibility to help these people
and no-
im not saying just give them money
but because they have to be taught to be
thats the last thing you want to do
yeah
i know thats what my father-in-law was talking about when you give these people money
or what was it
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give more money to these people
and thats not really the answer because if theyre alcoholics theyll just go out and spend it on booze or something like that
yeah
thats exactly it
but
theyre not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it
come on lets be realistic
yeah
thats just not realistic
or to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
right
i guess were getting kind of off the subject here
but
no
were not i dont think
i think thats more realistic than making them go in the $unc$peace $unc$corps
yeah
its
true
yeah
i think thats a lot more realistic
i think that we should be spending more time
and again i dont think the $unc$peace $unc$corps is as successful now simply because it doesnt fit the circumstance anymore
yeah
weve got plenty
in fact weve got far too many
youre in what $unc$flower $unc$mound
$unc$flower $unc$mound
yeah
so were a little farther removed from $unc$dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
i was
thats exactly what i was going to ask you
have you been downtown recent-
start
what kind of recycling programs do you have in $unc$rowlett
th-
right now theyve got kind of a central location off of the main highway
and theyve got some great big bins there for newspaper plastic i think $unc$three bins for glass white green and whatever other combination there is
and i think theyve got some kind of container for aluminum
planos doing real good on that
they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans which were supposed to put all our weeks garbage into it
uh-huh
and of course it doesnt fit right now
yeah
but now we start in $unc$may breaking it down
and theyre picking it all up
so theyre going to by
and we have to separate our papers and our glass
and then they have $unc$one day for everything you picked up from your yard
uh-huh
and we put that in disposable bags
and they pick that up on $unc$monday
so its really great
im completely for it
i think its marvelous
thats good
$unc$rowlett had sent out a survey not too long ago in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably because theyre going to do it
i dont know how soon theyre going to do it or how organized its going to be
but theyre supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months
does your
where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that
ive never noticed that
we dont have a whole lot because were in a hospital setting
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria
down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your pop cans and things like that
no
theres only $unc$one pop machine
and its not accessible to the cafeteria now
so mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
so you dont have much choice there
no
not really
i work at $unc$j $unc$c $unc$penny
and last week they brought
they have a sign up that says for $unc$one full week you bring in your old wire hangers
uh-huh
and theyre going to recycle them
so its getting people clean out their closets and such
uh-huh
and then the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in
and they brought it down to the shelters
and they have $unc$three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop
uh-huh
and they put them right near where they have the time cards
yeah
and it works great
and they have $unc$one in the room where the snack machines are too
thats good
so theyre really going at it
and i think its marvelous because
yeah
i guess rowletts done a lot for the size town it is
and i think theyre trying to make some changes
i noticed at the library or someplace this past month month and a half ago they were having a speaker talk about doing lawn work and how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag just to kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all the grass thats being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff
uh-huh
and its i guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil
did you watch the program the other night on was it $unc$save $unc$america
i saw part of that
it was good
the only thing i thought that i havent been trying is when i go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before
uh-huh
uh-huh
but ive already gone to
i started years ago i guess not years ago
but yeah
i would say $unc$five years ago turning off my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth
uh-huh
but i didnt realize that was the biggest waste of water
yeah
that was surprising to me
i missed that question totally really bad
im trying to think
i didnt miss too many
i cant remember what my score was
but i did exceeding well
i was surprised
but i didnt realize that our garbage isnt being decomposed
that was a shocker to me
yeah
there are a lot of things that arent
im
thats $unc$one of the things i wonder about
$unc$one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else
i wonder about some of the products that they dont take like some of the plastics and things that they dont take why they couldnt do more recycling with those
i was in $unc$bizmart the other day
and what i dont understand is there is recycled paper in there
and it cost more than regular paper
and it was only i think $unc$forty cents more $unc$fifty cents more
but it upset me to realize that theyre going through the expense of recycling
yeah
but people arent buying it
so the cost of it is higher
true
yeah
i noticed that about things like
i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing
but the cost is double or sometimes triple the regular fertilizers and things you buy
uh-huh
so in terms of that
its
and for the environment theres a good reason to do it
but the cost is kind of prohibitive
thats recycling
companies that do at least go into it
id like to see subsidy by the government or something or tax-wise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
uh-huh
so that people would use this stuff over again
yeah
its a good idea
its like when he was saying which $unc$one was recyclable which was reusable
uh-huh
and the recycle ones are better to use
but lots of times you dont even see the signs on the bottles
yeah
true
and if were going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it
i had to put my bifocals on to see it
thats hard when youre in a grocery store and youre short anyway
yeah
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf
you havent got enough nerve to say put it back
its not recyclable
id heard something stranger
talk about bottles the other day on the radio station i think its $unc$k $unc$l $unc$t $unc$y they were talking about the
i think its in $unc$canada theyre using recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs as a reinforcement for roads for road repairs
uh-huh
really
and apparently they dont break down very easily
and they dont expand or contract when the weather changes
oh
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing
theyre
along that same line they said they were using
what is oh i know
it was toilets you know the old ones smashing them up because that stuff there is great in road work
uh-huh
huh
and i thought thats good
and then i saw recycling on tires between
hoses were being used and soaker hoses made out of old tires
uh-huh
yeah
what else
something else was made out of old tires
i was trying to remember what it was i cant think of it now
but i was trying to get my kids to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
uh-huh
and just anything to recycle rather than keep throwing it away
but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the back
and then i forget to bring them in the store
yeah
im forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out
i wish theyd really push this recycling bit because i really didnt realize how much stuff i actually throw away
i think the more people are aware of it the more theyll do
i think thats just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
what id like to see a little more
i dont have any little tiny kids
uh-huh
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now in $unc$five years when they get bigger itll work a little bit more too
yeah
true
because its
weve all got to do it right now
i just
i really amazed to find out that $unc$eighty per cent are filled now in garbage fills
in $unc$five years were supposed to be at max
uh-huh
i dont think i can keep my own garbage
i might not have that much
but i wouldnt
i started when i was in college
they always offer credit cards for college students
yes
so i went ahead and accepted every $unc$one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
uh-huh
right
so i pack around a lot of them
but i only use a few of them
you have a lot of discipline
they make it really easy for people to get credit cards especially college students
yeah
i have $unc$two daughters who both are in college
or in fact $unc$one has finished now
but they both have a lot of credit cards
and they give you such high credit limits
uh-huh
its easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap
right
and then they give you the credit limit
and then youre always seemingly up to that limit
i have quite a few credit cards that im always almost up to the limit on most of them
and thats how a lot of people get into trouble
yeah
ive got $unc$two that usually ill have a balance on
uh-huh
and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an $unc$american $unc$express card and pay it off every month
right
and that way i feel like im getting a $unc$thirty day loan
yeah
but i dont have to worry about running them up too high except at $unc$christmas
then they usually get run up pretty good
yeah
you have a lot of discipline
im trying my best right now to pay off some of mine
ive paid off about $unc$four credit cards this year
uh-huh
but still i have some that are up to the limit
and especially the $unc$visa $unc$card that you can go and get cash on
yeah
and it seems like every time im short of cash i just go get it from $unc$visa
thats
ive never used my $unc$visa for cash before
uh-huh
can you use it at a bank machine
j-
or
you can go in a bank and just hand them the $unc$visa $unc$card and say i want a cash advance
or if theyve sent you a number that you can use a personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever you can do that
yeah
okay
because i have $unc$one that i dont have a pin number for
sometimes you have to ask them for that
yeah
and then i have $unc$one that just gave me the pin number automatically
we got
thats funny you said that because my husband and i got credit cards in the mail $unc$one day that we hadnt even applied for
uh-huh
a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers
and then we got a bill saying the yearly fee it was like $unc$forty dollars
right
and we cut them up and sent them back because we hadnt even applied for them
and we didnt want them
but they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
wow!
so i thought i dont know if i trust this or not
they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time
everybody in the world will offer you a credit card
its like lets see if we can get her to run up her bills
but its hard
its tempting when you see something to say well ill just charge it
and sometimes ill do that
but usually i will try to pay everything off the next month
or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time ill pay more than the minimum payment
uh-huh
uh-huh
just i feel like even that little bit helps
right
the way the economys going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible
thats why ive really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might get laid off or something
i know it
especially me
i work for $unc$texas $unc$instruments
and theyve had a lot of layoffs lately
i work for $unc$t $unc$i too
you do
and i think theyre getting ready to probably sell us out our division
where are you
in $unc$johnson $unc$city $unc$tennessee
$unc$johnson $unc$city
uh-huh
i know theyre selling out somebody in $unc$colorado $unc$springs
yeah
yeah
they just announced that didnt they
yeah
so its kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
it certainly is
i have worked on a part time job where i was a collector for a jewelry company
uh-huh
people that
they just had this jewelry account
it was $unc$zales jewelry in fact
and a whole bunch of peop-
they have about a $unc$thousand collectors i guess
man!
and theres just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item
yeah
and then they just cant pay for it
something happens
and you hear so many stories listening to them like they lost their job
or theyve signed for a friend
they got it in their name
but they got it for a friend
oh
and then the friend wouldnt pay them
didnt pay them
and now theyre stuck with the bill
and its ruining their credit
and you really have to watch this
man
because
thats scary
yeah
because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau automatically most of them do
i didnt realize that
yeah
and if youre
bad because if your bill is due on the fifteenth then youre not past due until the fifteenth of the next month
yeah
okay
but if you pay $unc$one day after that fifteenth youre not $unc$one day late
youre $unc$thirty days late
they dont recognize any time difference do they
right
ooh
right
thats scary
a-
and we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of
thats something i never thought about checking with to see what your credit report looked like
uh-huh
you can do that
i believe it costs about $unc$ten dollars
might be worth it for peace of mind
yeah
it is
it is
you might even find somebodys been reporting on you
and you didnt even know it
you might think youre paying something on time
and you by that day
and youre $unc$thirty days is not real bad though anyway if youve got a charge off on your credit report or something like that
yeah
thats when it really gets bad
or something you havent paid in $unc$sixty days or $unc$ninety days and things like that
i think that $unc$discover $unc$card has a good idea with giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase as long as you dont go crazy trying to get cash back
uh-huh
and since they dont have the yearly fee
do they charge a lot of interest on that card
i dont know
i dont
i havent gotten $unc$one just because its
uh-huh
i felt like with $unc$visa and $unc$mastercard and $unc$american $unc$express you didnt need another $unc$one
uh-huh
i would think it wouldnt be much more than the $unc$eighteen or $unc$nineteen percent everyone else charges
yeah
so that wouldnt be too bad
always watch out for anybody who bills you out of $unc$atlanta $unc$georgia
or theres a couple of other places that are able to charge us $unc$twenty-one and $unc$twenty-two percent interest
i know i had a charge with $unc$spiegel
and i hadnt read the terms of the credit agreement really
yeah
and when i did i realized that it just seemed like i was never paying the balance off
and i looked at the credit card agreement $unc$one day
and it was like $unc$twenty-three percent interest
holy cow!
and thats the $unc$one bill that i hurried and paid up
definitely
and ive always watched it since then
thats awful
you really have to watch those interest rates
theres no point in giving them any more money than we have to
thats true
so they cant bill you any higher than $unc$eighteen percent i think in $unc$texas
but there are a couple of states that can
thats great
and $unc$one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of $unc$atlanta $unc$georgia
ill try to remember that $unc$one
lets see
i was trying to think if there was anything else
i guess the worst problem i ever had with a credit card though was i got an item on my bill that i had never purchased
uh-huh
i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork
but they werent supposed to process it until they delivered it
uh-huh
and i changed my mind
uh-huh
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
oh
and it took me about $unc$eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account
wow!
so thats probably the worst thing ive ever had happen with a credit card
i wonder if they
okay
hi $unc$norma
hi
have you taken anything back lately that youve bought
the only thing weve taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed
why
and we had no problem with it
very good
we got our money back
good
do you think that consumer goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
i believe theyre better
i do too
i believe about $unc$ten years ago that we went through a terrible time
but i dont
i believe that theyre better now
wh-
i think so
i dont think theyre shoddy not as shoddy
electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable
however i didnt like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with $unc$sixty-three $unc$thousand miles on it
right
and i dont like it very well when my electric blanket that was only $unc$one year old went out on $unc$one side
did you return it
no
i had moved away
no
uh-huh
i had taken the first one back
i didnt think that it heated well enough
it never did get anything but just moderately warm
took it back
and the people told me thats the way its supposed to be
and i fell for it
and when i got this $unc$one it heated a little bit warmer
and then after $unc$one year it started heating only on $unc$one side
huh
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both
also i took an iron back after having it only $unc$one year
oh
i figure anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time
and $unc$one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
no
huh-uh
did they replace it
without even any question
but i think it was the store
uh-huh
$unc$wal-mart
$unc$wal-mart
i was going to say it must have been $unc$wal-mart
yes
and have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes
i havent bought any new clo-
the last thing i bought was a dress last summer
and the buttons turned on it over the winter
the buttons tarnished slightly
and i have not gone back about it
that was poor quality i think
i think it is too
and it was an expensive dress
i wondered if it werent expensive
yes
it was
and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever
thats right
thats what i think too
and the chain belt loop half of it raveled out
yes
and that was i believe a $unc$leslie $unc$faye dress
and it was i think over a $unc$hundred dollars
you spent that much on your dresses
yeah
i dont usually
but i did that $unc$one
youre really divulging very personal information
but i think it should have been better than that for that money is what i mean
of course i do too
i believe that weve been talking about $unc$five minutes
okay
i think so
and $unc$norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
good talking to you too
ive enjoyed it
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
well be talking to you later
bye bye
bye bye
and what part of $unc$virginia
i live down in the south western part of $unc$blacksburg
$unc$blacksburg
okay
ive been
uh-huh
have you ever heard of $unc$virginia $unc$tech
sounds vaguely familiar
$unc$v $unc$p $unc$i
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
i hadnt been down in that part of the state really
uh-huh
okay
we vacation a lot
how about you
quite frequently
i wish we did
we retired early
okay
so we take trips pretty often
where all you guys go
we go to $unc$maine every fall
uh-huh
then thats kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast
$unc$uh-uh
and i have a daughter in $unc$texas and $unc$one in $unc$new $unc$mexico
so we go out there
and we go to $unc$florida
and down
we were just out recently at the outer banks of $unc$north $unc$carolina
all these places that ive never been
is that right
where do you go
what type of vacation
it really depends
seems like i do a lot in the $unc$midwest lately
my fiancees familys from $unc$wisconsin
uh-huh
and so weve been out there a couple of times
and i went to $unc$purdue for a couple of years
so ive gone up to $unc$indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
uh-huh
and im a real big baseball fan
so i usually try to combine it with catching a couple of games somewhere
uh-huh
what club do you follow
im a big $unc$red $unc$sox fan
$unc$red $unc$s-
good
but i
me too
youre a $unc$red $unc$sox fan too
yeah
uh-huh
i usually try to catch whoevers in town though i dont specifically
i go to $unc$cleveland to see them play the $unc$indians or the $unc$red $unc$sox
uh-huh
thats about it
we do a lot of little trips around here
and
ever go up in $unc$pennsylvania in the mountains
or
not that much
weve gone out to a place in western $unc$pennsylvania called $unc$falling $unc$water
oh
have you ever heard of it
ive heard of it
ive never been there
yeah
its really neat
its this house built on a waterfall
and its really cool
uh-huh
of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there
the first time we went out there was the day after hurricane $unc$hugo had come through
gee
so they didnt have any power
and it was really cold and rainy
and we went up about a year later
and it was better but not a whole lot better
uh-huh
so where else did we go
weve gone to $unc$richland last year and had a good time down there
did you
did you go to $unc$williamsburg
have you been down there
my girlfriend has with her sisters
but i havent been down there
uh-huh
i hear thats nice
were going to get probably down $unc$norfork sometime this summer just to catch a football game actually
uh-huh
we were down
when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and spent the night there with a friend in portsmith and then went to $unc$williamsburg and spent a night
spend a day and a lot of money
yeah
yeah
ive heard
im not real interested in $unc$williamsburg because of the price attached to it
yeah
we just
i
but its pretty neat down to just go and walk around if you like to walk
its a good town to just walk in
yeah
well do that
you can go to the buildings and not go in if youre not
okay
so i can wander around without
yeah
you can wander
its a good town to wander in
okay
i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings
thats right
okay
i didnt know that
yeah
i think they do the whole with paying
yeah
they really did throw away a lot of money getting $unc$one thing or another
yeah
but they had a good time
so
we really didnt do that really this time we just visited around
weve done it a couple of times
and thats enough for probably another $unc$twenty years
yeah
i was
we use it live in $unc$california
and my
up around $unc$san $unc$francisco
and there was $unc$one year when my fathers company was starting to do stuff down in $unc$los $unc$angeles
so my father was working down in $unc$los $unc$angeles for like $unc$six months or so
it was closer i think to a full year
and hed fly down there on $unc$mondays and fly back on $unc$fridays
any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to $unc$los $unc$angeles
so i went to $unc$disneyland about $unc$five times in $unc$one year
oh
and i really have no great urge to go back now
thats great as a kid though isnt it
it was great because the times that were really fun were when we had vacation
but the kids in $unc$los $unc$angeles didnt
uh-huh
so we basically had $unc$one of the parks
right
theres still a lot of people at $unc$disneyland
but there was another amusement park down there $unc$busch $unc$gradens
there was nobody there when we were there we won a log floating ride like $unc$five straight times
we just get done with them and they go do you want to go again
sure
have you ever
youve never been down to $unc$epcot at $unc$florida and $unc$disney
no
id like to sometime
thats good
but
we really enjoy that
weve been $unc$two or $unc$three times and probably go back again this winter
yeah
ive never been
the fartherest south ive been on the $unc$east $unc$coast is $unc$charlotte
oh
so i keep wanting to get further
i thought i would go to $unc$florida a couple summers ago
uh-huh
but never did it
$unc$charleston is a really nice place to visit
my sister lives in $unc$charlotte
and theyve gone to $unc$charleston a couple of times and had a real good time
uh-huh
yeah
its a real pretty place
yeah
$unc$one of these days well get down there although i dont know when were going to have vacation to do it
were getting married in about a year
are you
and our honeymoon were going up to this place in $unc$wisconsin called $unc$door $unc$county
yeah
its up by $unc$green $unc$bay
its a place my girlfriends also wanted to go
uh-huh
and
is it on $unc$one of the lakes
its
i dont if youve ever seen a map of $unc$wisconsin
but theres kind of like a little thing sticking out in the $unc$lake $unc$michigan
uh-huh
thats $unc$door $unc$county
okay
yeah
that would be really nice
yeah
they call it the $unc$cape $unc$cod of the $unc$midwest
oh
so were thinking thatll be a lot of fun
uh-huh
she had this book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide
uh-huh
sounds good
so that should be a lot of fun
i dont know what our next trip will be i guess our next
i know what my next trip im going to be a grandmother in $unc$july
oh
the first one
boy
so my next trip is going to be to $unc$texas
thatll be fun
yeah
in the middle of the summer
yeah
you wont even notice it though
theyll be air-conditioning anyway
so
is that how you got into this data base
yeah
my daughters a temp at $unc$texas $unc$instruments and working on this project
okay
yeah
i was just
most of the people ive talk to are from $unc$texas
uh-huh
so when i heard you were from $unc$virginia i was like okay theres somebody different
and you said i got somebody down in $unc$texas
i go okay that the connection right there
thats it
yeah
i talked to $unc$one in $unc$california
i never asked him the other day how he was connected
i dont think he was $unc$t $unc$i employee
i
most people talk to $unc$texas
theres been a couple of other the people most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually
i see
so it was fun
yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab im in
is that right
we spent last week end in $unc$charlotte with real good friends that had just moved back east from $unc$oklahoma
oh
uh-huh
and shes working on this project too
shes talking on the project too
uh-huh
and we got back $unc$monday
and i got a call yesterday
and it was her on $unc$t $unc$i $unc$network
thats neat
i havent had something like that happen just getting the $unc$one guy from the lab
uh-huh
youre sure have a nice town
my sister lives on $unc$lake $unc$norman just
does she
thats nice out there
yeah
we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer
and its never really works out
uh-huh
yeah
its real pretty
yeah
well
traffic not much else we do for vacation really
just so we havent been able to take really
are you a golfer
no
no
me either
no
are you guys golfers
no
uh-huh
or
no
uh-huh
nope
not too much into sports
except our outside though
just walking thats all
i dont think there are any traveling that was in my early teens down in that area
and im know real sure there are
no professionals
when
i was thinking i might be minor league
but
theres $unc$one in $unc$salem $unc$salem $unc$rebels
yeah
$unc$salem $unc$rebels
$unc$buccaneers
$unc$buccaneers
okay
yeah
yeah
i may be seeing them in a town just west of here $unc$frederick has a minor league team that plays in the same league with $unc$salem
and i think we may be seeing them this weekend
is that right up there in $unc$frederick
yeah
i think theyre out of town
uh-huh
yeah
thats a nice little town actually $unc$frederick
ive never been up there
ive never visited $unc$baltimore
id like to go just sight see a little bit sometime
theres some nice things in $unc$baltimore
the $unc$inner $unc$harbor and the $unc$aquarium and all that are very nice
uh-huh
theyve just done a
i
the $unc$aquarium is $unc$one of those things that because everybody
okay
were going to talk about our lawn and garden chores
do you have either $unc$one
i dont do anything with the lawn really
but i do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening
do you
really
i
we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
and thats fun
wallys had $unc$one even when we havent had big yard because we enjoy that
we love fresh vegetables in the summer
and its just $unc$one of the things i enjoy doing
so do i
i had rather be outside than inside any day
so would i
do you work during the week outside the home
yes
i do
uh-huh
so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward
i work for a school system
so im able to do that because i get home a little earlier
yes
and i can still do some sorts of things
but
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight
absolutely
i unfortunately am not gardening this year
i love gardening
in fact i was prevented about $unc$thirty years ago with a life membership from the $unc$richmond $unc$virginia counsel of garden clubs
wow
and it wasnt because i was so good
but i organized a very large garden club
but i still have
thats wonderful
its always something that seems so odd to me
but
but thats
and you really feel you can accomplish something
and to help other people too thats neat
yes
it has really nothing to do with actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that
uh-huh
it was just that i happened to organize this group that was about $unc$seventy people
right
thats wonderful
that
isnt
yeah
that
yeah
those numbers were great
but it
yeah
i think it sounds good
ive never belonged to a garden club because ive always been more interested in just doing what i can do on my own
ive never had the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format
yes
but i know people who do it and enjoy it very much
and i think that most womens garden clubs that ive been aware of in the past are only flowers
what i would like
weve spent the last $unc$twenty years in $unc$oklahoma
just moved to $unc$north $unc$carolina
oh
and we were originally of course from this area from $unc$virginia
but in north
in $unc$oklahoma its the mens garden clubs that i would have wanted to join
my word
and you would have because they do all kinds of gardening and not just flowers like women do
for heavens sake
uh-huh
uh-huh
there arent mens gardening clubs in this area that i know of
theyre women
and usually theyre the tea type things where they have a little luncheon
and they do their thing
uh-huh
but flowers are primarily the emphasis whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more i do flowers sort of look pretty
yes
i think so too
but i really like to do the vegetables
yes
and i have spent the last $unc$ten years being a florist
being what
being a florist
my
what a wonderful thing
it was nice
it was exhilarating for many years
yes
many of those tanned until the last couple when we had such an economic slowdown
terrible
yeah
yeah
tell me whats in your garden this year since i dont have $unc$one
okay
the flowers im just
in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in
i always have geraniums
and then i have a shady area that i need to be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun
uh-huh
so ive discovered that impatiens that tried and true turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus because they look pretty in my front garden
uh-huh
but i like the vinca which is something i hadnt
they look sort of like impatiens
but theyre not quite
and theyre better for the sun areas
and of course mine are old theory ordinary flowers marigolds and that sort of thing
yes
in my
do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds
no
i dont
maybe its
i dont know
maybe this climate is a little better
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
but in the vegetable garden we grow usually what
our favorite is something called white half runner green beans
now thats
do you
isnt that funny
so is my favorite
you know why because i grew up in $unc$north $unc$carolina
okay
and that was my mothers favorite bean
she always grows $unc$five different varieties
yeah
but thats the kind that produces the best
yeah
i think it has the best flavor
and theyre wonderful
and i pick them when theyre very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit
my mother picks them when theyre fat
and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs
yes
uh-huh
i like them in between
and theyre good both ways
i like them in between
yeah
yeah
the flavor is better i think in between
in between the
size wise
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
my mother
my mother doesnt think they have any flavor the way i cook them
and i know i love them
thats the yankee way
but i think thats another vegetable
of course
i love them that way just the thrill of
yeah
it is
theyre $unc$two different vegetables that way
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
in fact my mother who is $unc$eighty-six years old $unc$canned over a $unc$hundred quarts of half runners last year
my gosh
my mother will be $unc$ninety this year
and she lives in western $unc$north $unc$carolina
and she would do that if we didnt tell her that shed better not
yes
uh-huh
yes
but she doesnt have that big a garden
but she has a bigger one than i do
real-
yes
and i have $unc$four children
so
and she tends to it herself
yes
yes
uh-huh
isnt that wonderful
it is
its great
its really her joy
and i suppose thats why i enjoy gardening because growing up with it
i think so too
yeah
we also grow yellow and green squash much to my childrens chagrin
uh-huh
right
and we grow a lot of tomatoes
uh-huh
theres just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes
no
so we enjoy that
we grow
i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family
but i actually was successful for the last $unc$two years
so
wonderful
im going to do it again
bet you showed them
thats right
and we grow broccoli
oh
and i have been very happy about the new way of controlling the worm that gets in broccoli by using the $unc$bacillus $unc$thuringiansis which is the little
in fact thats what they use for gypsy moth
i dont know if you have had that problem there or not
no
but its a problem thats moving south from the $unc$new $unc$england area
yes
and they devastate the trees
so the government sprays $unc$two $unc$three times in the spring when the caterpillars are coming along because what they do this bacillus the worms ingest it
and it expands in their digestive tract
and they die
uh-huh
so thats the same technique that is for any of the other little varmints that get in vegetables
so it
thats really very nice because its a non toxic way of handling the problem
great
we could really talk gardening a long time
im enjoying hearing you so much
its nice hearing you talk
and i wish you good luck
have you just recently moved to $unc$charlotte
a-
no
$unc$october
so thats not very long
so yes
recently $unc$seven months
and it
yes
the weather is wonderful
i love it
thats great
thats great
it is just terrific
rains a little too often
i hope you have an opportunity to garden again
i think so
i have a little spinach
good
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
so how do you think weve changed in the last $unc$ten to $unc$twenty years
im at a little bit of a loss
i dont know
$unc$ten years ago
im about $unc$twenty-eight now
so when i was $unc$eighteen
uh-huh
things havent changed a whole lot
really
people are being a little less bigoted in some ways
i dont know
uh-huh
seems to me
i guess im like my parents
the younger generation gets away with hell
but
yeah
it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
but that may just be because ive changed
i used to live up north
down here $unc$dallas seems to me the police are militant
really
but
whered you live up
whered you live at
i lived in $unc$akron $unc$ohio
did you
im from $unc$illinois
so
oh
how long you been in $unc$dallas
about $unc$eight years
really
in fact in the $unc$eight years ive been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live i think
yeah
as youre talking like police and stuff like that its definitely a tough job to do
yeah
i think its
crime has got a lot worse in the last $unc$ten $unc$fifteen years
yeah
i agree
and maybe that has a lot to do with it
yeah
i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse
and i think theres
to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values
yeah
thats true
thats true
but
id say my own personal lifestyle has improved
yeah
but thats more a matter of
im no longer a teenager in high school
yeah
yeah
i think theres more pressure on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be
and
hello
somebodys at the door
hang on just a second
okay
okay
but i dont know
thats $unc$one thing i see a lot more double income families and a lot more baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess
yeah
thats true
its getting more and more expensive to live
yeah
thats for sure
you cant make it
yeah
without it hardly
thats right
i guess when i was growing up it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house
and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever
yeah
yeah
you just dont buy a house
just because they cant get into $unc$one
yeah
thats right
yeah
the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you cant ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways
yeah
so yeah
thats a good point
so im trying to think of anything else thats changed over the last $unc$ten or $unc$twenty years
yeah
for me its kind of hard
i dont know
i think
i dont know i think the middle class is shrinking and the lower class is expanding
yeah
i agree
and sooner or later theres going to be a turn around
i hope so at some point
but i dont know at what point
but i think its going to be at the expense of the middle class
yeah
so usually is i think
yeah
its
its hard for me to say
i hope it happens because id be $unc$one of those that gets caught
but on the other hand theres a lot of injustice that needs to be changed
yeah
thats right
do you work at $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
do you
yeah
what department do you work in
im in semiconductor
are you
im in semiconductor division too
yeah
how long you been with them since you moved down here
about $unc$eight years
yeah
im over at the $unc$center $unc$one building
yeah
so am i
are you really
what floor
$unc$two
im on the seventh floor
how about that
its a small world
so lets see
second floor you work with linear
yeah
do you know $unc$alec $unc$morton
yeah
ive probably seen him around
you do
he comes up and pushes us around
so im pretty familiar with
are you d a d or something up there
are you d a d or something
yeah
yep
you must know him
his reputation precedes him
yeah
seventh floor
yeah
t a d
boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief
they say its what makes him happy is to give us d a d grief
so i can believe it
but
yeah
lets see if youve been in $unc$dallas $unc$eight years i guess thats about how long
ive been in here about $unc$eight years too i guess
been with $unc$t $unc$i like $unc$twelve
but i started out in $unc$lubbock
$unc$lubbock is
i dont know
i guess if this is the only place youve lived $unc$lubbock is a lot different than $unc$dallas
yeah
flat dry and dirty
yeah
yeah
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too
here in $unc$dallas everything is just real rush rush
yeah
i lived in the country for several years
and living in the city is a whole different social structure
yeah
but
i got some friends that
seems like he went to school at $unc$devry
is there a $unc$devry in $unc$akron
i dont even know
oh
i havent been up there in years
i see
he went to school somewhere in $unc$ohio
and hes from that area
and he works over in the $unc$park $unc$central building i think
but i havent talked to him in a while
but yeah
he misses it
he used to go back twice or $unc$three times a year because he missed it
sounds like you havent been back there in a while
no
i havent been back in $unc$ten $unc$fifteen years
you still have relatives back there
or
yeah
i do
i just havent had a chance to get back
oh
catch them next year probably
really
lets see
how long are we supposed to talk here
i dont know
i think we ran out of social changes to talk about
so
yeah
my kids are probably needing me to go
so
okay
all right
its nice talking to you
yeah
talk to you later
all righty
bye
bye
$unc$kathleen do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system
i certainly do
i think we have a lousy school system
and what do you think that problem is
and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we dont train our teachers very well
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents
and then we put too much responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education
theyre social services
that seems like youve thought this through quite a bit before
as a matter of fact i just finished editing a book on the topic
so i have some rather strong opinions
thats interesting
do you yourself
and im sure theyre colored by what ive edited
do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system
yes
i do
and i was not very happy with the results
i see
so if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it
i think i would start with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators and all the auxiliary personnel the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself
uh-huh
right
and then i would use the money that weve paying them to provide some special help in training and particularly mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time
uh-huh
sure
sure
and then let them try some innovative things and see what works and then have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things and then from the parents side have the parents support the school get involved
uh-huh
uh-huh
pay attention to whats happening talk to the teachers talk to their kids about school and support the institution
and a-
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the teachers in the middle
uh-huh
thats some pretty good ideas
why dont you do something with those
ive done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people
uh-huh
you should run for a school board position
that im not so sure about
ive got a lot of things to keep me busy
uh-huh
that
have you done anything like that
anything political
my mother was on the school board as we were coming up
uh-huh
and that basically is the extent to which our family has been directly
theyve always been involved
my parents through the $unc$p $unc$t $unc$a organization
and my mother was on the school board for $unc$eight years
uh-huh
but thats more than some people less than others
thats more than a lot
i would tend to agree with you that there is a problem
the methods of correcting it i havent thought through quite to the detail which you have
but i believe that theres definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher
uh-huh
and if there was a way through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem a little more prestige to being a teacher
and with that of course you have to pay them accordingly
if we paid them more it would attract more the higher educated people to either move into that field or to continue in that field
yeah
and then if you paid them more youd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them
i think thats absolutely right
they
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board youre going to be rewarding people whove been doing a lousy job instead of getting the improvement that we want
sure
sure
so wed have to have some way to reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
uh-huh
and its a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones
uh-huh
yeah
its hard to tell
so its very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than i guess how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class
if theres some gauge that they could make
yeah
also ive thought about the idea of making teaching and the
before you can get a certificate you have a certain residency period much like a doctor
maybe not the $unc$four years definitely
but some certain type of position where youre overseen to begin with
yeah
thats a very good suggestion
just something to i-
rather than throw someone into that environment it
yeah
i dont think student teaching is enough
i thought that maybe something
i think that at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher
uh-huh
right
and then the student teacher didnt stay but about $unc$six weeks
uh-huh
so there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much
sure
sure
there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like video taping because it wouldnt be hard with all the electronic equipment thats around these days to video tape either a master teacher teaching a class so that then students could watch that and criticize the methods used and analyze it figure out what worked and what didnt work
uh-huh
and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance
sure
sure
thats good as a teaching aid
but more you see these commercials that have $unc$jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in $unc$new $unc$york while jimmys in $unc$rome
and the whole electronic classroom idea
i dont know if im in favor of
i dont think thats going to work
i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn
yeah
another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of say a national curriculum because $unc$one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in $unc$texas and $unc$california
and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach
huh
is that because thats where the $unc$two biggest markets are
because it
or
thats the $unc$two states that adopt on a state wide basis
i see
and so it
i used to work for a textbook publisher
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by $unc$texas then you had a built-in market because there were only about $unc$three or $unc$four textbooks in each subject
and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
uh-huh
and a third of the $unc$texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
sure
sure
and then the states that either dont adopt on a state wide basis or dont have as many kids just have to follow along and take what $unc$texas gets
right
$unc$california is the biggest for elementary schools
but $unc$texas adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade
i see
definitely is a national problem that they need to address
yep
sure is
definitely is
and i hope maybe were going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with reagans new education secretary trying to produce some new programs anyway
right
right
excuse me
ive enjoyed speaking with you
i have got to go
ive got another line calling
thanks
all righty
good-bye
bye
okay
sorry
wow
thats okay
tell me about your home
it looks like a little shot gun house almost
its got $unc$three bedrooms going along $unc$one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
uh-huh
its an older home
its not new
i like it though
its big
really
what kind of square footage
i wouldnt know
i measured it $unc$one time because we had saw some termites
and we thought about getting it sprayed
i think it was like
i cant remember
im sorry
thats okay
thats okay
its big enough for us though
uh-huh
we kind of need maybe $unc$one more room
weve got $unc$two children
uh-huh
okay
so where do you live at
what part of town here in $unc$denison
okay
we-
thats north
or down here in $unc$denison
yeah
okay
i live in $unc$plano
so its north to me
okay
up here then
i say down
im really from $unc$kentucky
i was going to say you didnt have the typical
you have a southern accent
uh-huh
but you dont have a $unc$texas accent
right
im originally from $unc$ohio $unc$cincinnati
okay
so im familiar with
that area
that dialect
right
right
also i lived in $unc$georgia for about $unc$four years
so the
theres a difference too between east and west in the south and the way in which people speak
uh-huh
my home i guess its about $unc$twenty-five $unc$hundred square foot
and i have $unc$four bedrooms at the present
were busting out walls and things like that
thats what i want to do
how many kids do you have
we have $unc$two
we have $unc$two
do you have enough bedroom space then
yeah
well have enough bedroom space
its
were rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small
uh-huh
and so were going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit
thats kind of like what wed like to do
we just had a baby a couple months ago
and weve got a den
its more or less a spare room
uh-huh
we rarely go in there except for to play $unc$chess
uh-huh
we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter
and we need the $unc$one extra room
like you said the bedrooms are too small
the living room and kitchen are huge
right
but the bedrooms are too small
where youve got to leave the furniture just $unc$one certain way you cant rearrange it at all
right
theres they
i know what youre saying there
ours is the same
and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
yeah
we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for
yeah
weve got $unc$two great big windows in our back bathroom
uh-huh
youre kind of limited in what you can do there and everything
so
no privacy
no
we dont have a lot of that
yeah
weve got at least $unc$two windows on every wall in the house
it
uh-huh
id hate to clean these windows
i really would
i figured im going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean
ours are the double pane
and you cant really clean them on the inside
ours are those too
yeah
you must live in an older home too then
right
i do
the house is id say almost $unc$thirty years old
uh-huh
so its not a new home
its seen some wear and tear
ours has too
when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it
uh-huh
and he did it hisself
so most of that by now is falling apart
oh
its not just horrible
but this tiles come loose off the wall
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
and i dont like that at all
that is awful
with the great big square tiles that you put on the floor the huge one
uh-huh
he did it in that
yeah
instead of wallpaper
i wouldnt mind it if it was short tiles
for that you put
the normal tiles
right
right
that you put around a bathtub
that would be prettier
uh-huh
but this looks like floor covering on the wall
it just doesnt look good
and also theyre very heavy
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier
right
theres $unc$one big one that has come off
and short of putting nails through it we cant get it back on
so
and he rewired the house
and its shorting out here and there
and
wow
i
thats $unc$one of the things weve been fortunate with is our wiring is okay
we dont have enough power
or our breakers arent powerful enough to really help with the load in the house
uh-huh
we need to redo some rewiring ourselves
but our plumbing is awful
there is a shut off valve thats outside that doesnt work
and theres no other real shut off valves inside the house
so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street
yeah
and it can be really bizarre
yeah
and we never know where its going to flood
weve got power surges on the west side of our house
weve got our stereo hooked up
uh-huh
that
the power makes it run
its never ran
its always ran just fine the clock and stuff
uh-huh
but it runs about $unc$ten minutes fast except for about a month the clock ran normal
and then the power went off again
lightning or something knocked it out
and we hooked it back up
and now its running $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen minutes fast again
but on the east side of the house it runs fine
boy you do have a strange wiring problem there
he put new wiring in
its all new wiring up in the attic or i guess crawl space
uh-huh
uh-huh
but no
he didnt know what he was doing
he really should have hired people
thats something
my husbands in construction
and he wont even touch electrical stuff
he i-
hell do a little things
but he wont do any major rewiring
he says hed rather pay the electrician to handle it
right
hell end up killing himself
pardon
end up killing theirselves
thats right
my husband hell change out a light switch
but thats about as far as hell go
thats the way mine is
yeah
he said he went up in the attic and looked around
and he was like my god
he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there
and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry
was a what
the roof was really sorry
when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was
uh-huh
it was a wood shingle roof
and we
the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof
he put
which
i heard its a law that youre only allowed to have $unc$three layers of shingles
is it $unc$three or $unc$five
husband probably knows
he probably knows
i dont know what it is off hand
hes got $unc$seven layers of shingles up there
and he told us it was a completely new roof
like i said he didnt know what he was doing
yeah
he must not of
we stripped ours off
we didnt put it over cause we put composition roof on
and we completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up put the paper down and just started from scratch
uh-huh
unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain
no
we had almost id say about half of the roof off
and it did this
and a house full of snow
and a house full of snow and rain
uh-huh
and it came down
it did this in the middle of the night
we have plastic just tied down on everything as best we could real thick edge stuff
uh-huh
and the wind came in from the north
and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
and we were asleep
and i woke up
and i got up
and it was about $unc$four oclock in the morning
and i heard all these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip
no
i had water coming in every light fixture
that
yeah
i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere
and it filled up my light fixtures because theyre the old kind
uh-huh
and i would go in
and id turn on a light in the room
and the light would come on
and the whole thing would be full of water
and the light would still come on
it didnt blow up or anything
a friend of mine when i lived in $unc$louisiana her
we all lived on base
my husband was in the $unc$army
uh-huh
she woke up about $unc$three or $unc$four oclock in the morning water dripping from hers
the neighbors washing machine had over done something
i dont know
but it was leaking just pouring water in
and it all went through to her roof
and it was coming out of the lights fixtures
oh
the fire alarm went off for some reason
it shorted it out or something
yeah
that will happen
so she woke up with about $unc$six feet of water in her house
my lord
no
not $unc$six feet
but
but its quite a bit quite a bit
you know that
yeah
you might as well
so did you have carpets and stuff
several of our rooms got ruined
we have
we are on pier and beam
we dont have concrete slab underneath our house
uh-huh
so it got into the carpeting got into the floor
the carpeting was already awful anyway
but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
s-
your house sounds like mine because mines pier and beam too
really
yeah
yeah
they came in
and they had it
$unc$one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it
we had to call the insurance company
the insurance company was paying for the new roof
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired which really wasnt our fault
uh-huh
wed done everything we could to keep out the weather and stuff
thats right
thats right
and
you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
yeah
it
are you finished with it now
the roof
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
its been done for quite some time
were really glad with all the rain weve had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof
uh-huh
how long have you lived there
its $unc$three
its just been at $unc$three years
weve been in the house just the $unc$three years
weve been doing a lot of remodeling
it had a detached garage
and my husbands built a walkway across
and were going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
so we
you all did it yourselves
what the walk
the home improvements
yeah
yeah
see he does this for a living
uh-huh
this is what
all right
quite a few
and theyre varied
they dont encompass many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing
uh-huh
but i do quite a bit of wreath making
and my dogs are my hobbies
i do a lot of gardening
i go to estate sales which takes up a lot of time
uh-huh
what do you mostly do
mostly right now i do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible
were about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff
boy
yeah
that should be fun
yeah
fun for them
yeah
how old are they
ive got a little girl whos $unc$six and a little girl thats $unc$three
i think thats better than having that party at home
yeah
this is a friends party
and they rented
or they
the party
they just rent skates and stuff for the kids
yeah
so theyre looking forward to it
and the skating rink does the rest practically i guess
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
boy what a help that is
yeah
so
what kind of
how long have you lived in $unc$north $unc$carolina
not that long
really
just since $unc$october
we moved here from $unc$enid $unc$oklahoma
oh
uh-huh
so were originally from $unc$virginia this part of the country
uh-huh
but we did spend $unc$twenty years in $unc$norman and $unc$enid and loved it
uh-huh
uh-huh
but we needed to get back to our older parents
yeah
uh-huh
but i am loving it
the weather is divine
really
yes
w-
did you like $unc$oklahoma while you were there
yes
very much
yeah
what did you all do
my husband was with $unc$university of $unc$oklahoma and $unc$phillips $unc$university in $unc$enid
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then he went with a family corporation that has oil and ranching and varied enterprises
uh-huh
and he just quit a perfectly good job and we came east
really
yes
so is he working there then
or
yes
uh-huh
hes doing quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position
uh-huh
and hes contemplating
uh-huh
hes liking this free time
yeah
its just wonderful after all these years of working
yeah
yeah
how did you get hooked up with the $unc$t $unc$i switchboard thing
a gal who works with $unc$t $unc$i on this project
uh-huh
i think shes a temporary worker
mother is my best friend in $unc$virginia
i see
so we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country
i see
uh-huh
w-
my wife has talked more than i have
shes talked to $unc$four $unc$five different people
it seems like she hasnt talked to anybody from $unc$dallas
in fact shes talked to a couple of people from $unc$north $unc$carolina i think
really
yeah
what is her name
her names $unc$tina
yeah
i havent talked to her
i havent talked to a $unc$tina yet
yeah
uh-huh
w-
the call was probably for her
they wouldnt accept my $unc$t $unc$i $unc$n number
so we put hers in
but like i said were getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party
yeah
yeah
but some of
yeah
ive only talked to $unc$one or $unc$two
and theyve all been in $unc$dallas
but she hasnt talked to anybody in $unc$dallas yet
yeah
yeah
so thats interesting
you havent told me what sports that you are active in
the sport i like best probably is basketball
but i guess im probably better at softball
and so id
during the summer months its occupies quite a bit of my time
yes
but i play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend
but my family usually goes with me
we try to do everything we can together
i think thats easy entertainment for a family too
yeah
yeah
they
a good friend of mine that plays on $unc$one of my teams we
thats usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age
so they play together pretty well
under the stands
and
under the bleachers
yeah
yeah
pretty much
and $unc$tina enjoys the other lady real well
so they
thats kind of nice
its like getting together with them
yes
its getting a little hot isnt it
so to speak
it
yeah
its been raining a lot here so far
so we havent really had any kind of real heat
i think its going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago its already $unc$eighty in the house
so it looks like an air conditioner day
yeah
but
it sure does
or maybe this evening anyway
yeah
it
yeah
but im sure youre familiar with that living here
very much so
we go through enid quite a bit
we go to $unc$tulsa from time to time
and my parents live in southern $unc$illinois
so we drive up there
yeah
and lot of times we take $unc$seventy-five
and it seems like that goes through $unc$enid i know
no
no
it doesnt
ive either seen the signs or
$unc$enid is
its in the northwest
its directly across the state from $unc$tulsa
i know ive seen the sign somewhere
sure you have
yes
$unc$enid is not an unknown little city
yeah
it
right
an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there
and it was a very self-sufficient wealthy town for a long time anyway until everything happened
uh-huh
uh-huh
the bottom fell out
but
uh-huh
its beginning to do well
but theres a lot of old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things
uh-huh
uh-huh
so how l-
you said youve just lived in $unc$north $unc$carolina just $unc$six months then is
$unc$si-
yes
something like that
and you really like it there
oh
ive heard so many people talk about that area
ive never been there
its pretty
but they sure say its pretty
the weather is wonderful
this winter we
it was just
we had so many wonderful days
and
uh-huh
i
if it got to be $unc$forty degrees i decided it was too cold to walk the dogs
isnt it funny how your standards change
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it really does
my wife and i spent a couple years doing church work up in the state of $unc$washington right on the coast
yes
and it rains a lot there
sure
but you get used to it
its like a fine mist all the time
and it doesnt really
it gets to where it doesnt bother you
foggy and misty
really
it
the moss grows on the trees in the woods up $unc$eight $unc$ten feet
uh-huh
right
right
yeah
thats the way it was there too
yeah
i think however thats like $unc$february
i know it did it all $unc$february
and some people said to me thats our wintertime
uh-huh
i know you need to go
but
and ive enjoyed talking to you
i have enjoyed talking to you too
it was nice to talk to you
thanks so much
have a
i hope you enjoy $unc$north $unc$carolina
thank you
and i hope you enjoy and get through that birthday party
i hope i live through it
yeah
i do too
thats what i hope
okay
thanks a lot
bye-bye
good-bye
all right
how long have they been recycling there in $unc$virginia
quite a while
ive lived here for $unc$six years
and can you hold on just a second
yeah
uh-huh
hello
uh-huh
im sorry
i must have got the other line cut off
so theyve been doing it for a while now
uh-huh
and it
i live in an apartment
uh-huh
and my facilities
there it is
hold on
uh-huh
hello
okay
sorry about that
yeah
okay
youre okay
yeah
okay
they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only
ive been recycling for maybe about $unc$two years now and at another public facility where they have recycling of glass aluminum and paper
uh-huh
have you recycled plastic also
no
and thats what i dont understand exactly why they dont have that option
we have out here up until just this last year in on you are town there wasnt any really good way
uh-huh
they had some bends around that we could find and put them in
uh-huh
but not all that many
it wasnt very well advertised
uh-huh
but recently the refuse department is working on getting a system going where we will actually have a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
uh-huh
so it should be good
uh-huh
i think its a marvelous idea when i just think of the papers that i dump out
uh-huh
there just
its such a
i waste
i just hate to think about it
yeah
an additional thing is
where i work they also have recycling there of all white paper and of cans also
uh-huh
uh-huh
so a lot of people right at the vending machines they have receptacles that you can just pop your cans in
uh-huh
uh-huh
and near the $unc$xerox machines they have places for your paper
uh-huh
uh-huh
i keep a little box at my desk
uh-huh
and as im using the white paper i just throw it right in there
and then they have someone that comes around and pick it up every afternoon which is an excellent idea at work because i know the amount paper they go through there
yeah
thats neat
yeah
because
yeah
thats right
i guess $unc$one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it
uh-huh
theres needs to be more public service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
yeah
i would agree with that
uh-huh
uh-huh
and theres
right
ive seen a few things but not very much really
uh-huh
and i think thats a shame
they need to do a little more
id like to know for instance when they say plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to
exactly
uh-huh
maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they cant use
i dont know
uh-huh
but id be glad to organize it if theyd tell me what it is im doing
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
i agree with you there
another thing that i like here which is
i do with
i have to actually go to $unc$two different recycling areas because $unc$one of them is that
their aluminum cans is for childrens $unc$hospital for a burn fund
uh-huh
so all the monies are donated for the recycling to childrens $unc$hospital which i think is an excellent idea there because the other public
yeah
uh-huh
thats great
that gives you a little bit of incentive there
right
right
uh-huh
and before even at work
before they started the recycling plan which at work theyve only been doing since $unc$january first of this year i had had everyone in my department recycling
and i would have them drop their cans off in my office
saving them for you
and then i would haul them here to this place for the childrens $unc$hospital $unc$fund which got people really going into it
uh-huh
i think thats right
but
i think helping us be more enthusiastic about it helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt
uh-huh
uh-huh
that
there you go
thats for sure
but i think thats
i think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of advertisement and letting you understand more of what it is youre doing why youre doing it how its done and what happens to it because i think that would help a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
and im sure in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more
yeah
ive seen a definite trend towards more recycling everywhere even at mcdonalds with their use of no foam containers anymore
yeah
i
yeah
yes
im glad to see some of these things i think
right
i think it is getting more advertisement
people are becoming more conscience all the time that its necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped
right
uh-huh
and all these things that
right
i think thats true
i think
thats about my some on recycling
yeah
but i enjoyed talking to you
okay
i did too
uh-huh
all right
bye
okay
bye-bye
i have
i used to have the opinion that there really was not any more crime in $unc$america in the cities than there was in previous centuries before
simply because
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced reporting methods with computers and other devices
compile more statistics
thats right
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets
uh-huh
however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime
more especially where you are
are you in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c or $unc$washington state
yeah
no
i am in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
yeah
yeah
i was going to say
it
i do a lot of business here
and i come here quite often
and that again is a sort of media perception theres some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in $unc$washington regardless of the racial makeup
yeah
but its real
theres pockets of violence that is so violent that they
it just really grabs your attention
yeah
it just makes the whole place seem like that
right
just to focus on that a minute i guess
when $unc$bennett i think his name was became the drug czar for $unc$president $unc$bush he was going to focus on this area and do something about it
yeah
and i see that even he was met with little success even though i guess quite a bit of money and other planning efforts went into that
what do you think is causing all this
because it seems that there
even though
crime though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too
yes
i have $unc$three theories about it $unc$three things
i have $unc$one theory
and its brought to us by $unc$two things
$unc$one i believe that this is a function of the violence that young people see on television and the movies
uh-huh
and i am not just talking about role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that
i am not even convinced that maybe things like football hockey and even baseball games now where everything is settled with a fight the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument
and then i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree
so i think that particularly
i was reading the other day about $unc$corpus $unc$christi $unc$texas which has the highest
i think its $unc$corpus $unc$christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in $unc$america $unc$per $unc$capita
yeah
i have not seen that
but
the $unc$saturday night special stuff
so
yeah
thats what i think about it
thats some of the things i think about it
plus i do not know
what are your views
yeah
i tend to agree with you with
it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless theres just some sort of violence or something in it
yes
and along with that
and then you start making a movie and theres no call for something violent
so they just throw something in there just to say they have it
exac-
thats the impression i get
yeah
and i imagine that it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society
people want to
it conditions people to it
and you have to amp-
it has to be even magnified to attract peoples attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that
yeah
you become callous
yeah
and i am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women
and
yeah
i read now where we are
young women are arrested fighting with knives over whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young
i do not want to sound like an old fart
but thats what
seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television
and i have to think that it has some influence on it
but
i listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time
yeah
i do not know if you listen to him or not
no
hes on a m
but theres a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the
there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for $unc$los $unc$angeles the guy under $unc$gates
yes
and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals
for instance they asked him if he spanked his kids
and he said you bet i believe in discipline
and people i guess they confused discipline with punishment
yeah
yeah
and just
it seems anymore that if you have this type of a moral stance that people come down on you
its like hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing
and i disagree
and i think thats really contributing to this high rate of crime
yes
yes
i guess what i wanted to say and i stopped i do not know i got diverted was that theres so much of a return to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure
and that is not emphasized
i recognize theres over crowding problems
and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now thats complicated the entire process
yeah
what i also think that
i guess its the reflection of the society where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to
it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live
or i do not mean attachment and responsibility
i guess i mean any sort of
nobody feels responsibility to do something
its like boy i wish they would stop doing that
yes
thats right
yeah
yeah
i do not know how thats
i do not think its done by
the changes come simply by statutory nature
i do not know what it really will take
and i do not know if i have solutions except to
i am sort of an advocate of having free speech
and i guess to curb
the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that
yeah
however there does seem to be a
right now in verbalizing
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort
yeah
and then how many
and the sacrifice is not that great
how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between what you see and how yo-
yeah
what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do
yes
yes
i think thats correct
and yes
but as soon as you start
$unc$texas has always struck me
i have lived in and out of $unc$texas both in the service and short business stints
and it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state
but thats a
but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state
just citing that
yeah
unfortunately you have got a lot of the
a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences just that we are so close to the border with $unc$mexico
yeah
we have got a lot of that influence
yeah
yeah
yes
i talked with people from $unc$richardson and $unc$plano
and the first $unc$three days
and then yesterday i talked with someone from $unc$pennsylvania
so
yeah
because
its the
ive only made
this is only my third call
oh
i tried to make calls $unc$two different days
and i couldnt get through
i know
sometimes i just
im in
it just takes a very long time
so
does it
yeah
ive been trying to do that
and sometimes i just cant wait that long
yeah
i know
so i just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again
this is hilarious
but i knew as soon as i heard your voice
i thought its $unc$kathy $unc$kester
tell me what books have you read lately
lets see
i cant even think
i havent read any
and youre such a reader i know that
and i
i dont read all that much for enjoyment
i read a lot for school
but i just dont have much time for enjoyment reading
yeah
the last book i picked up was a book by $unc$judy $unc$bloom
uh-huh
and it was called smart women i think or something like that
yeah
and it was kind of
i really didnt like it at all
it was written back in the early eighties
yeah
and it was all this divorced woman syndrome of the
yeah
it was almost like a pre-aids scare kind of thing
interesting
it was really an interesting
because i right away looked at when it was copyrighted because i could tell by the theme almost when it was written and a lot of hanky-panky going on
uh-huh
yes
yes
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that kind of was kind of a pop psychology time when a lot of books like that were coming out i think
thats right
and so that makes real sense that thats when it was written
yeah
yeah
i wasnt really aware that she had written anything for adults
i was always just more aware of her jer-
uh-huh
for her young people her books
yeah
and shes more famous for that
uh-huh
but she has been writing for adults also
ill be darned
and so i thought ill just try this and see what it was like
yeah
it was very
the style was very conversational
uh-huh
you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
you know how that is
and
yeah
i wonder if shes written anything really recently if shes got anything in print
yeah
she has
because i remember seeing a new book by her that was out
uh-huh
and i think it was an adult book
ill be darned
yeah
but thats the last thing ive read
yeah
and
its
im trying to think the last actual book i read that wasnt
lets see i think i read
when i was on semester break between spring and summer
yeah
and i went to my mothers
i read a book that i should have read when i was probably in high school
i read $unc$jane $unc$eyre
i
no
wait a minute
wait a minute
wait a minute
$unc$jane $unc$eyre
no
no
no
no
it wasnt $unc$jane $unc$eyre
wuthering heights
no
it was pride and prejudice by $unc$jane $unc$austen
yeah
by $unc$jane $unc$austen
yes
thats what it was
yes
yes
and i didnt know what to expect except i had heard that $unc$jane $unc$austen was such a wonderful novelist
and she really was good
i was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately
uh-huh
and i just
but as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadnt read something before then
yeah
because i think i read it in college or had to read it in high school or college
but i dont remember it
yeah
yeah
and then when $unc$jennie had to read it at $unc$gettysburg i got her someone
uh-huh
i think it was some actress reading it
how interesting
they had an abridged version of it on tape
yeah
and so i got that for her
and she loved doing that
ill bet
yeah
but i remember that was the book
yeah
and i think its around here somewhere
right
i wouldnt be surprised
im just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it
yeah
sure
yeah
but
i read that
and then im trying to think
usually i try to find something long that im going to
uh-huh
if i have long periods of time like $unc$christmas vacation or when i know im not going to be doing anything for a while
yeah
thats what i do too
yeah
and thats about it because otherwise im reading so much for school
i have just started reading a book
its for school
but its for
theres a literary jour-
not a literary journal
its kind of a journal of the history of ideas thats starting to be published from $unc$u $unc$t $unc$d
the first issue doesnt come out until next year
but
yeah
im doing some reviews of books to sort of recommend whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal
how neat
and ive
yeah
its really neat because these are brand new books
and i got this $unc$one
great
most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that
uh-huh
uh-huh
this $unc$one is on $unc$johann $unc$sebastian $unc$bach
and its a biography that is really interesting
great
thats fascinating
its fascinating
it really is
oh
but its so long
i dont really have the time to read the whole thing
but i think eventually ill go back to it
yeah
but it was written
yeah
the copyright is $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety-one
so its a brand new book
its a brand new book
yeah
uh-huh
that would be wonderful to read something like that
yeah
and this man really shed some light on some aspects of bachs genius and the more sociological things like the idea that to be a musician was as much of a family occupation as anything
yeah
families had just loads of musicians
yes
yeah
and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these all passing it from $unc$one to the other
yeah
thats right
yes
uh-huh
and
yeah
thats the way it was im sure back then
yeah
so
yeah
thats interesting
it was just really interesting
if thats kind of what
but i have to
not only am i reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also because the board of advisers for this journal right now doesnt have a really respected name whos a scholar on music
uh-huh
and im supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be in that position on the board
so
yeah
i dont know if i want to take that responsibility or not
but at least i can tell them what i think
thats rough
thats real rough
so its real interesting
yeah because i think my $unc$alma $unc$mater $unc$gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine that was similar to that
yeah
it is
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think thats probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges
yes
yeah
but
that it
you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
because it attracts really a lot peoples interest
thats $unc$one way
its really good public relations for small schools
yeah
i think so
yeah
but another $unc$one of my projects this summer its helping a professor compile a bunch of translations of various poems for a book that hes writing
and so im learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of french people
oh
translations what do you mean translations of
for instance a $unc$baudelaire poem that was written in the $unc$french and then has been translated into $unc$english by various people
yeah
uh-huh
i see
and the translations are all so different from $unc$one another
all different
uh-huh
thats interesting
so its multiple translations of single works
and thats right now pretty much what im doing as far as
my work is just kind of compiling all that for him
gosh
so
thats great
its real interesting there are days when i would prefer really doing that
boy you really lift me up to a different
here im dealing with cleaning the stove
and
i wish i were dealing with $unc$baudelaire
that would be nice
i dont know if ive told you
but this is not on the subject
what do you think about it
i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations such as the health field the transportation field
theyre already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth
they do it to prisoners
yeah
so i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions
and i think if an employer feels that he wants to drug test employees and they dont like it then they should not be employed there
that was
i would not mind it
yeah
i especially agree that if its an area where they could cause somebody else harm or injury absolutely
right
and i dont have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring process
but i dont have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact
but i do a little bit where it wouldnt hurt anybody
i dont know
sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far
uh-huh
but
unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business
yeah
right
maybe its
and then its not a problem
number $unc$one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft
yeah
and as an employer i would think that would be
and the first
its not going to be wholesale because of the cost
absolutely
theres no way
but my concern is school bus drivers
yeah
tr-
the train drivers
im not even
im in education
im not even opposed to it for that
im concerned in the medical field
yeah
i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug
i wish they would
i wish they would
and that i think is even probably more widely abused by the masses than drugs so to speak
right
right
right
but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train
i know
and
and it doesnt take that long
they dont have to be totally roaring drunk
no
just a little off on their timing could mean life
just
yeah
and
now $unc$t $unc$i has the random testing policy
okay
and our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool
uh-huh
so ive already been tested once when i was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i work with $unc$one girl who was tested her name got randomly selected $unc$three times in $unc$six months
my word
and i think thats the only reason i have a problem with it when theres no reason to suspect someone
control
thats getting a little bit
thats enough to make anybody paranoid
right
as long as you accept that it is a random testing to alleviate
yeah
that way you cant feel like somebodys out to get me
right
if
its almost like being selected for jury duty
yeah
so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel
thats just the way it is
either just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it
i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because i think when you let other employees turn in people
absolutely
there are so many people with their petty axes to grind
right
it could really get out of hand
right
so i would really rather know however
theres got to be some backup to say that
if somebody does observe you at a party using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that
yeah
to report it
and i guess youd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol
personnel or something
right
id feel really uncomfortable
right
right
i dont know what kind of work you do
but there would even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way
yeah
we have a lot of people who work on the line
im in accounting
so it wouldnt
they couldnt hurt me with their $unc$ten key or something
right
but out on the line theyve got people working some serious equipment
right
right
its
especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that theyre not being put at because theyre the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims $unc$et $unc$cetera
put at risk
i agree totally
and im not sure but what some of the insurance claims arent due to illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
and in the long run were all paying for that
right
so it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that
right
i was trying to remember there was a court case here where i live just a few months ago
the city workers they wanted to
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
and the city workers took them to court to protest saying that it invaded i guess the search and seizure amendment
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its still tied up in the legal channels
they havent ruled on whether they can test them or not
so im curious especially since a local employer is also already doing it seeing what theyll say about it especially since
to see how thats
is it just a small group of the employees that are concerned
its the whole city
seems like the whole group of city employees thats raising a stink over it
they just dont want to be drug tested
yeah
so
my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested
yeah
my husbands retired from $unc$i $unc$r $unc$s agents
uh-huh
however this isnt a problem that we have either alcohol or drug
right
and so in our minds were thinking whats the big deal
yeah
thats the way i looked at it
if i had something to hide its $unc$one thing
but im
you dont
so its not as big a deal
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether theyre really concerned about their rights or whether theyre really concerned about something else
right
and then they say if you give them the right to do this then theyre going to take some other right away from you
but i firm-
i dont believe that
i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything
and of course $unc$one of the big deals now too is that when you come into a company you sign a paper saying that i will go take a
okay
ill let you start
do you all keep a budget
and how do you hold to yours
no
i never keep a budget
my budget or philosophy i guess is spend as little as possible
thats good
and its sort of always worked
especially for these times
uh-huh
but that depends on the individual if they can i guess have self-control
thats a lot of it
i know we tried several different ways
$unc$one time we tried something that really worked
but we didnt keep it up
i passed it on to a friend
and she wont quit doing it
she loves it
and that was the envelope system where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend
uh-huh
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that
so you have $unc$one for entertainment and $unc$one for groceries $unc$et $unc$cetera
and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form causes you to realize how much is left
and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what shes buying
uh-huh
and then at the end of the pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment
uh-huh
and they kind of work it that way
we tried for a while
and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldnt think about
yes
and those are the ones that will kill you
the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that werent supposed to be every month
yeah
i couldnt probably be bothered doing that every month
uh-huh
and ever since
thats what i mean
it was a hassle
weve been married almost $unc$thirty years now
but my husband got paid once a month
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you learn to get
thats kind of hard
right
you learn to get through to the end of the month
and
but do you sort of self budget even
you wouldnt on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that
you kind of think this is got to str-
no
you kind of divide it in fourths in a way dont you
no
because if you charge things you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid
right
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day
right
you pay all your bills
and there isnt anything left to spend anyway
thats true
what were in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
and were going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
yeah
we tried to
oh
we are paying them off now
yeah
were not there yet
there was a time when maybe we didnt take all of them off
uh-huh
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
uh-huh
thats right
thats right
and for most of
im a substitute teacher
and ive only substituted i guess for the last $unc$fifteen years
so theres only been really $unc$one working
uh-huh
same here
uh-huh
and it works for me
but i cant see that it would work for probably the majority of people
i could say its kind of
thats good
you probably have a little extra than you have to have to
you know what im saying
yeah
and so thats the difference there where sometimes i know if weve had an especially bad month and were just almost getting down to payday then i think if we could really budget
we tried $unc$one tim-
i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadnt had a car payment in $unc$five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was going to be left
uh-huh
yeah
and that was a real eye opener uh-huh
uh-huh
it is when you do it that way
but to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes ill spend less on groceries but well go out
so its kind of hard to say this is how much youre going to spend going out for fun
this is how much youre going to spend
its kind of hard
we eat out a good deal at this point
do you
i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money because i knew that you couldnt spending $unc$five $unc$thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever
yeah
yeah
right
right
we were going to go for $unc$ten weeks in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty
oh
so i started working in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-seven and just saved for $unc$three years
how nice
uh-huh
but the
what minuscule amount i made
but that way you just didnt put it on your credit card
w-
thats
and it was paid for
and it made a big
and you enjoyed it better probably
yes
yeah
and so i think that thats difficult for most people
but then my father was very $unc$scotch
i think so too
and you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to
so if youre out in a department store and theres a sale youre just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you
yes
thats excellent
thats what im working toward
i think youre probably much ahead of me there
and im working on it
and i never worried about saving money because were in the savings plan at work
and they took it out
so
same here
same here
i
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you dont have to go through the company to get
uh-huh
we never had too much of that
yeah
but then we never had any really emergencies that
that came up
yeah
and we didnt buy really new or expensive cars
i think the most were looking at cars now we ever spent for a new car was like $unc$six $unc$thousand dollars
uh-huh
and they were mainly used cars
thats the best thing to do
my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasnt worth it from the day after
yeah
so
weve been rather frugal in that respect
rather frugal
thats going to payoff on retirement
yeah
it
i guess weve completed
do you think weve been here to in-
each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please
how would you go about organizing a family reunion
a-
for
i grew up in the deep south like south $unc$alabama
so whenever i think of family reunions
my family got together almost every week
gee
and there would be like $unc$thirty people
so people talk about big family reunions
and i think
i have a friend who just went to wyoming to some big ranch where there were $unc$four $unc$hundred people for their family reunion
my
and i
so how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives
uh-huh
since i came from
my father has $unc$five sisters and $unc$two brothers
and my mother has $unc$four brothers and $unc$two sisters
so i ca-
both of my parents had big families
and we always got together just always
now its different because i live here
and i
when i go home i try to see as much of the family as i can
but its real different
yes
and i grew up in a real i think not normal setting
with all of you living so close together
right
$unc$sunday dinner was at my grandmothers
and like i said there would be $unc$thirty people
and everyone would just bring things
and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook
oh
and i-
i come from a very small family
and we planned a family reunion this spring where we are from $unc$texas
and my family is from $unc$ohio
and we met in $unc$florida
uh-huh
so the $unc$seven of us went on a cruise and then went to $unc$disney together
so thats all the family
so planning our family reunion was very easy you know
yeah
i guess so
it really sounds like it was fun
yeah
we had a wonderful tim-
i almost forgot the topic
i was waiting so long for it to find somebody
its on your favorite t v shows and why
right
what is your favorite t v show
$unc$major dad
you like that $unc$one
i love it
i think it promotes good family values
and its funny
uh-huh
ive never really watched that $unc$one
its funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
thats ri-
yeah
and theres only a few that i like to watch routinely
what kind do you like to watch
probably my favorite is
i like shows like growing pains
and whats the other one now they moved from $unc$tuesday night to $unc$wednesday night
so i dont get to watch it very much
wonder years
wonder years
yeah
thats my favorite
i like both of those real much also
i think basically they promote family values
yeah
wonder years
i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever
i guess i can really relate to it
and its just a real cute show
i guess i like the shows that really have a real sense of i dont know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess
i do too
i dont like lot of the shows that ive liked in the past like golden girls
and some of them tend to get so risque
and when you have children watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me
uh-huh
yeah
right
right
and thats $unc$one of the reasons
if you want to go all time favorite show probably $unc$one of them was little house on the prairie
uh-huh
yeah
my wife really likes that show
yeah
which i always felt was wonderful
uh-huh
and so many of them nowadays like i said i think are just
yeah
they go after
they
like i said the risque stuff just i guess they think thats what people want to watch
yeah
there was
but theres a sense of i guess purity in the show
$unc$one of my favorite shows used to be happy days
yes
but $unc$richie always used to be just so honest and pure i guess
yeah
and when he left the show it seemed to be missing that part of it
uh-huh
and i never did like it after that
uh-huh
so i dont know
i see the same thing in wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch
there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere
yeah
i agree
do you like the sports programming
yeah
$unc$uh-huh
i enjoy those also almost as much to a certain extent
im
our whole house is baseball fans
uh-huh
and we enjoy that
and
so youre going to watch a game tonight
yeah
yeah
so do you have a favorite for the series or anything
probably the $unc$pirates
but only because of $unc$steve $unc$bushel i guess
uh-huh
otherwise i really dont care that much
but im annoyed that the $unc$rangers got rid of him
and id like to see him do well all the way to the bank i guess
yes
yeah
hes a nice guy
i take it you live in the $unc$dallas area
do you live in the $unc$dallas area
live in $unc$plano
uh-huh
yeah
i live in $unc$garland
and yeah
i like $unc$steve $unc$bushel
but i dont really like the $unc$pirates
im a big $unc$saint $unc$louis $unc$cardinals fan
uh-huh
so im kind of pulling for the $unc$braves over all
theyve come from so far down
uh-huh
i really would like to see them do well
yeah
yeah
its
so i keep hoping the $unc$rangers are going to do
yeah
$unc$one year they
maybe theyll make it i dont know
right
but yeah
i like sports programming quite a bit
but i guess my favorite shows are the
and getting back to the point that you made thats really true
we were watching $unc$roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago
and her daughter was talking about birth control
uh-huh
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time
and shes only $unc$seven years old
so
its
so many of them now it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in
and im an adult
yeah
yeah
and i have adult tastes now
but i dont need that
yeah
yeah
i like things that are wholesome i guess
yeah
that seems to be more our values too
the wonder years its kind of risque stuff maybe for teenagers
and you can kind of relate to it
uh-huh
i dont know
thats
i enjoy that a lot
yes
yes
but i agree with you
the
and its funny because the shows
a lot of them that used to be considered risque like threes company and stuff i think they maintained
people would watch them because
there was really the period that was going on there
he really wasnt messing around with the girls
but everybody perceived him that way and stuff
uh-huh
but as soon as he went to move in with another girl the show just died
yeah
and its interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
okay
im ready
okay
so were going to talk about what kind of clothes we wear while we work
uh-huh
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
no
i work at home
you do
youre like me then
i stay home also
do you have children
yes
i have $unc$two a $unc$seven year old and $unc$three and a half year old
thats good
how about you
i have $unc$four girls
oh
theyre $unc$nine and $unc$five and $unc$three and a newborn
you are busy
yes
and theyre all girls
i have $unc$two girls
so all girls around here
girls are nice arent they
yes
really sweet
anyway as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size
thats how i am too
we go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes clothes that are in between where youre not down to regular size yet or youre on your way up from regular size
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats funny
and theyre all in boxes or bags
and they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time though
yeah
i dont get a whole lot new right now
yeah
yeah
i know thats kind of how i am
i said who ever i talk to is going to be board because when its summer time im wearing shorts
and when its cold im wearing sweat pants unless im going to something special that my daughters doing or something like that
yeah
yeah
i like jeans a lot
thats good
i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids
and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places
so
and its frustrating
i find i have to get the right kinds though or its not comfortable
yeah
they
it works best if they have pleats in the front
right
yeah
and they have to
my waist is kind of small compared to the hips
so it has to be not the straight up and down $unc$levis kind
yeah
yeah
i know what you mean
but i
i was pregnant through the summer this time i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
oh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
thats right
but
$unc$one of my daughters was born in $unc$june
and i remember i wore sundresses and just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
yeah
yeah
and i had $unc$one that was born in $unc$december
so it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter
uh-huh
so even into $unc$november and $unc$december i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses
course im always hot when im pregnant too
so
yeah
yeah
i didnt really need warm clothes
but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new units outfits that are just knit
i havent tried those
they are so comfortable
huh
its just a light weight kind of a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff
yeah
and its just great because you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want
yeah
or you can just wear them with tennis shoes if you want
so theyre really nice
and ive enjoyed wearing those
uh-huh
but i
i dont know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here
but i sure never wear them
yeah
i dont either
if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference
yeah
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby
uh-huh
and i had to wear a dress every day
and it was a little bit hard to wind down
im watching $unc$janice
uh-huh
i would have to drive $unc$six $unc$thirty $unc$five home
and i would be burning up like in the summer time
oh
by the time i got home i was like ive got to get out of these clothes
i remember that from when i was
i worked way before i was married even
but offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you cant wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable
uh-huh
right
right
youve got to have something to add to it or something
yeah
yeah
i dont know if you can
yeah
and then when you drive home especially if youre in a lot of traffic which you are in $unc$dallas
you burn up
uh-huh
yeah
because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time
yeah
i was afraid id make the car overheat
its hard on the car
yeah
so i would roll my windows down
it was still a $unc$hundred degrees
oh
and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up
and i had a friend who used to take shorts to work
yeah
and after work shed go in the bathroom and change her clothes
thats funny
and i thought thats probably a good idea because you really
yeah
at least something cooler
yeah
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if its something that has to be dry cleaned which i dont have any of
thats true
yeah
i dont have to worry a whole lot about that
no
when you have children you dont
even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when im through
thats right
something that it doesnt matter if it gets spit up on too
i know it
ive always been a creature of comfort too
me too
if its not comfortable forget it
i know
thats how i am too
wool was never comfortable to me
right
me neither
i have
okay
where do you enjoy dining out
i generally go to the quickie places just because theyre cheap
yes
do you have children
we have $unc$four
but most of them are gone now
so there might be
but we were taking $unc$four $unc$five and $unc$six people out
yeah
that makes a difference doesnt it
yes
what area of the country do you live in
im in $unc$texas
yes
i am too
but
and we lived in $unc$ohio prior to this
i did too
im from the $unc$dayton area
oh
yeah
but i look for service even at the quickie places type things
uh-huh
i dont like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong
thats right
and then youre stuck
and its a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave
yes
so i really dont like the drive-thrus that much
i like to go and eat there
but i would say service atmosphere and whether the food is good
and on going out i like steaks
so we try to hit those places when we can
when we travel we look for wendys because we have kids
and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals
uh-huh
and then that way they can get their burgers and fries
and we can have a salad bar
yeah
so sometimes we drive for a couple $unc$hundred miles until we find a wendys because its all either mcdonalds or $unc$dairy $unc$queens
and in the countries unless its a large city i guess $unc$dairy $unc$queen and $unc$wal-mart are their main
right
thats right
thats what you find
right
i know
my husband likes $unc$dairy $unc$queens
he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess
uh-huh
so hes a fan of $unc$dairy $unc$queen
and well go even in town here at times just as a change although im not that excited about it
uh-huh
but we eat out so much its gotten so i dont like to really eat any place
but yet i hate to cook food at home
oh
so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because were eating out probably $unc$five nights a week maybe
uh-huh
or we eat junk food at home
yeah
now my husba-
what are some of your favorite inexpensive places
well go to them all
we sort of take turns
and we
i sort of favor the ones
if i have a coupon we can go there
and if not we cant because its cheaper
uh-huh
so mine is i guess strongly monetarily based
well go get pizza at $unc$little caesars although the kids prefer dominos
we are $unc$little $unc$caesar fans here
right
thats where we always go
but its just a lot cheaper than dominos
so thats
we go to grandys quite a bit i would say
yes
we like grandys too
mcdonalds weve sort of been off of that for a while
and no particular reason
and i
maybe we avoided wendys the last few years because our daughter worked there
and she never wanted us to show up there
oh
so we dont go there that much
where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal
a nice meal
where do you go for steaks
its usually when were out of town
oh
and ill order steak or steak and lobster combined
uh-huh
so its really not in town
oh
you ever been to houstons on $unc$belt $unc$line
no
thats where we go to get steaks
uh-huh
they have a teriyaki steak there
and when we have something to celebrate we head to houstons
they dont take reservations
and you wind up waiting about an hour
uh-huh
but the food is good
and theyve got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at $unc$five oclock
then you can go right through
right
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks
so thats our nice place to go
we dont usually take the kids when we go there
but we dont go out that much
i guess we do go out without kids
were usually picking things up quickly
though we just dont dwell on food too much
yeah
and with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places
right
thats right
so it doesnt really matter to him
hed probably just like to stay home i think i never have liked to cook food
yeah
thats the way with my husband
hes gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends
and ive been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
but i think it all began eating out when we had the boys on baseball tea-
right
it was mainly baseball teams
yes
and my husband would coach
so we were never home at the same time
uh-huh
im not one thats going to fix the meal at $unc$two oclock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever theyre there
right
or you fend for yourself
yep
you go somewhere else
the types of vacations that i usually take
i usually come back more tired after my vacation then i do before i take it
i need to definitely take a vacation where all i do is rest
and i guess to do that id probably have to take it at home
oh
but the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the $unc$bahamas and $unc$florida
i enjoy the beach
after our last summers vacation i am antibeach
antibeach
uh-huh
we went to $unc$cape $unc$hatteras
uh-huh
we were out visiting $unc$one of our kids in $unc$maryland
and we went down to $unc$cape $unc$hatteras for a few days
uh-huh
and the waves were huge
ive never quite seen waves like this $unc$one
uh-huh
and i was standing in water not more than barely above my ankles
uh-huh
and when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden youre in sand above your ankles
right
and i was standing there talking to my daughter
and this really big wave came and totally threw me
and $unc$one foot did not come out of the sand
and it tore the ligaments in my knee
uh-huh
so im never going to another beach again ever
im ma-
you might be like i am
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
but i really dont like to get in the ocean
i prefer a swimming pool
i love to go and play around
at least i always did although i like the mountains
i dont really like hot weather
uh-huh
thats my biggest gripe about living here
uh-huh
and i basically dont want to go to a hot place on vacation
right
i can understand that
oh
my dream vacation is $unc$alaska
uh-huh
this is just someplace ive always wanted to go
that would be nice
and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there
uh-huh
i know ive taken several vacations to $unc$colorado
and i used to live in $unc$colorado sometime ago for a couple of years
and i really enjoyed that
uh-huh
yeah
id like that
i havent been to $unc$yellowstone for a long long time
uh-huh
and weve been talking about going there next summer
i dont know well have to
yeah
ive never been up to the $unc$yellowstone area
so
its been a long time
but it seems when your family is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit
thats right
thats right
you got that
im
we usually go up to $unc$wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from
uh-huh
and my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here
uh-huh
uh-huh
and weve got $unc$one of our kids lives out on the east coast
and so we have to go to those
you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then
i know
but im tired of them
right
i want to go someplace different up there
thats right
my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with money be no object so just absolutely first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and not worry if somebody says lets take this little side trip and not have to sit there and figure out again we fit that in there or not
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
and thats what i would like to do
i have no interest for example in taking a cruise
uh-huh
to me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling
it would be sort of
i feel like it would be confining
yeah
i would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
uh-huh
yeah
i just
that does absolutely nothing for me
uh-huh
but i dont know
i can say that i think my favorite spots are still to go where theres mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view
and i like that kind of stuff
i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery
yes
i agree
i can do that too
and i think if i had the money i would probably go to $unc$europe every year
because i think that they have it all over there in $unc$two miles
uh-huh
theres mountains
and theres beaches
and its all right there
so
yeah
i guess ive never really thought about it that way
our
we have a daughter whos almost $unc$thirteen
but shes a very picky eater
uh-huh
and our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is $unc$holly would starve to death if we took her into the country
oh
but i would like if it was anywhere in the world to go i guess even though its hot
right
i would like to go to $unc$africa
real excited when i heard this
so far ive been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment
football i love this
yes
this is great
were from $unc$colorado
so were $unc$bronco fans
and we just moved here $unc$two years ago
and they went to the $unc$superbowl when we first moved here
and they lost again
that was pretty pitiful
but they seem to be doing pretty good this year
i was from $unc$illinois originally
and i grew up a $unc$bear fan
and then we moved here
even when we knew we were being transferred here we became $unc$cowboy fans
oh
and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under $unc$roger $unc$staubach
and we kind of got spoiled
yeah
we expected it to continue forever
i think theyre doing pretty well this year though
have they just lost $unc$one game this year
i think $unc$two
$unc$two
i know they lost to $unc$washington and $unc$philadelphia
yeah
but theyre not doing bad
people are pretty surprised that they beat the $unc$giants
yeah
and wasnt that fun
i went to the balloon festival in $unc$plano and carried my little portable radio with me
and i must say i attracted a lot of attention
i bet
people running up saying whats the score whats the score
boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
thats right
and thats exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
yep
but i wasnt
i had forgotten
or i probably wouldnt have been there
yeah
yeah
im a big football fan
i never wou-
my father was a football fan my whole life
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff
and i just hated it
and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on $unc$sundays
yeah
so when i met my husband he was watching football
and i figured out that i couldnt see him all weekend
i couldnt see him until $unc$tuesday because $unc$monday night football if i didnt like football
so
thats exactly where both of the wives came from i think
yep
it was
its easier to join them than fight them
uh-huh
uh-huh
and if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football
yeah
and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games
uh-huh
i do
i love it
i just think its such a fun sport
and im just hoping that the $unc$broncos can get back on their feet
were not convinced that were going to be $unc$cowboy fans yet
but
it takes a little brainwashing first
i guess well first have to get to used to the idea that were staying here
yeah
thats even harder
but
are you transit usually
do you stay not in $unc$one place too long
no
were just
this is only the second place weve lived
weve only been married for $unc$five and a half years
and we have $unc$two small children
and he just got transferred here to $unc$e-systems
so
it will take you a little while
but youll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for $unc$denver
oh
i tell you this
the weather here and theres no mountains or anything
and when you go to a football game in $unc$colorado theres snow
and its an adventure
and here youve just got to drive down to the stadium
i know
and
if they close it in well have the best of both worlds then as theyre talking about doing
yes
but $unc$dan $unc$reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway
hes from here
yeah
thats right
he was $unc$one of our boys
thats what i hear
so we never cheer against $unc$denver unless theyre playing the $unc$cowboys
which is rare
yeah
which is good
yeah
but i
its funny
in $unc$colorado when the $unc$broncos went to the $unc$superbowl $unc$three times in the last i dont know $unc$five or $unc$six years whatever its been they have these songs on the radio
they take popular songs and change them to fit the $unc$broncos and stuff
uh-huh
and they had
i was just thinking about $unc$one the other day
if i saw a picture of $unc$john $unc$elway in the cafeteria at school
but they did the $unc$johnny $unc$angel
they did $unc$johnny $unc$elway to that
$unc$johnny $unc$elway
and i was trying to get my son to sing that
my husband was just having a fit dont have him sing that song
but they do a lot of fun things
i think football is kind of a sport that i think its hard not to like it
because theres just
there is so much about it to like
its exciting
its so exciting
yeah
and when the $unc$cowboys won the superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs
and we all ran out and bought the records
and now we feel like theyre kind of a collectors item
yeah
yeah
they probabl-
i wish i would have bought the tape when i was in $unc$colorado
because i think about that a lot
but when i first moved here i guess it was about a year ago they did this
this interstate $unc$seventy-five song or whatever it was about $unc$central $unc$expressway and getting it done in $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety-five and everything
uh-huh
that was kind of a funny song
but they sure do
it seems to me like they really love their $unc$cowboys here
even when they were losing pitifully people still support them
we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs
we love the $unc$cowbo-
are we paying too much in taxes
and are we getting what we pay for
whats your opinion
its kind of a broad subject
i think there are some areas where we pretty well get our moneys worth
but i also think there are a lot of areas especially in federal government where were short changed lot of money spent for things that are not used
and i was in the $unc$air $unc$force
and there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste
it was just sitting and rusting
and
okay
i tend to agree with you
when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that dont mean anything
yeah
but well spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on
yeah
and its nice to know something doesnt work or something doesnt exist
but it could be put to more practical use
yeah
and i think that its a tone of our times that politicians are into themselves more than they are into doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which is really unfortunate
that is true
i agree with you in that area
i have a tendency to
im from $unc$texas
and i read how our politicians voted each week in the paper
yeah
and its interesting how the votes vary
and what they ran on in platform dont necessarily come true in their voting in the $unc$senate or $unc$congress whatever
uh-huh
and dont really respond to people who write them and call them
and unless theyre in the limelight and under pressure
so
yeah
i think we get short changed on that
right
thats very true
what state do you live in
$unc$texas
okay
thats
what do you think about $unc$robin $unc$hood
i work for school district
and it has hurt us a lot
there has to be some way i think to equalize education opportunities
but i think especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it
and i dont
thats just not true
i dont think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills
i think there are too many things that money cant buy that are important as far as education is concerned
thats true
what school district do you work for
$unc$richardson
okay
i work for $unc$plano
oh
great
were comparable
yeah
as a matter of fact i just paid my $unc$richardson taxes because i live in $unc$richardson and supplemented the $unc$robin $unc$hoods very thoroughly i think
yeah
i think we have got it on the line dont we
our taxes went up tremendously
yes
and its not going to get any better
its going up and up and up
i used to live in the $unc$plano school district
and there was a taxpayers organization that finally communicated the message i think to the people in $unc$plano that we didnt want our taxes raised
yes
i remember there was about $unc$five years ago
yeah
yes
but this
i think living in $unc$richardson were kind of spoiled because i think we come closer to getting our moneys worth as far as the city is concerned i think than probably any city in the country
yes
did you read in the $unc$dallas paper where they increased the administrators pay by $unc$thirty $unc$three percent after they laid off all those teachers
is that incredible
thats the biggest mess ive ever heard of
how can you justify raising anybodys salary if you have to lay people off
right
but im not going to complain because we all got a pay raise this year
yeah
you all got a pay raise this year
yeah
is that correct
i think the teachers did
and i dont know about administrators
im semiretired
and i was an administrator
so i dont get a raise anymore
i work part-time and just get
okay
my pay doesnt change
are you on the early retirement
yes
are you enjoying it
yes
very much
course i still work $unc$two part-time jobs
so its not really total retirement
its interesting because when you look at what $unc$richardson has done with the early retirement you
$unc$jeri
yes
were supposed to discuss crime in the $unc$united $unc$states and what can be done with it
thats a rather broad topic
theyre usually pretty broad anyway
yeah
where do you live
we live in $unc$plano
okay
thats a
and where you are
im in $unc$richardson
so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at $unc$maceo $unc$high $unc$school in $unc$dallas
uh-huh
right
right
that is so frightening
it is
do you have children in school
no
mine are already in college now
so i dont have to
yeah
at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages
i have
my oldest is his first year in high school
so we have all this to look forward to
and it is really frightening to think that you cant even send them to school in safety
certainly you cant just turn them loose in the middle of $unc$dallas
but when you cant even send them on their normal activities in safety its really frightening
thats true
and i really
theyre coming down on the principal
but i really dont know what they can do
its just in so much of society with the violence
and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
and i really dont know what can be done
yeah
i just dont understand of course in my little world how guns could be so available
i dont either
but apparently they just really are
to me in $unc$plano you would think that would be about as innocent as you could get for being in a large area
but my son comes home and tells me that he hears kids talk about having guns
and someone came to his football practice about $unc$two weeks ago with a gun
my heavens
and it just scared me to death
and they called the police
and nothing happened
but my goodness it could have easily
maybe thats the answer to crime is getting more prosecution
maybe so
because i dont
now somehow i feel were living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped
and people dont do anything
yeah
a woman was raped in $unc$richardson i read in the paper about a $unc$two weeks ago now
and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
no
but nobody did anything
i just cant imagine that
they heard someone calling for help
nobody even called the police to say i hear a strange screaming
right
im afraid if you
i dont blame people with todays society about going out to help themselves
right
i can see especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because it could be dangerous
but certainly i cant understand not calling the police
yeah
i
i just
its really frightening that were trying to live in our own little cocoons
and probably $unc$one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
right
i think youre right there
i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business
but i think thats real dangerous
and i dont know
i try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of whats around them
and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever
yes
but
yeah
the call for help is what scares me now because it just
i dont know
people just dont
i dont know
i cant say they dont care because people just have to care about another person
yeah
but its that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today
maybe this thing with the child at school maybe that will make people think a bit more and take some steps to correct it
i dont know
it really is frightening
yeah
i
let me ask you
getting back to your sons football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police arent doing
he didnt have a license for the gun correct
i dont know
i dont know the details
this was not a child that was on the team
it was someone that just kind of showed up at the field
uh-huh
it was a student age person
but im not even
tell me what you like to do
i collect antique tools for $unc$one thing im sort of in an antique business
but its a little part time thing
oh
uh-huh
wonderful
and im building a log house at a farm that i have in $unc$east $unc$texas which is a $unc$hundred miles from here
oh
wonderful
yeah
its really neat
and course ive been working on it for $unc$five years
but
but how wonderful
are you close to getting it done
yeah
yeah
its getting real close to
oh
of course theres still a lot of work to be done
and then when you get the shell finished you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
but
are you going to move your whole family over there then
no
actually im not even sure
i may
ill probably always have a place here in $unc$richardson or $unc$dallas
uh-huh
kind of your getaway place
yeah
escape
but its beautiful
its $unc$eastern $unc$hardwood forest
there are a lot of pine trees
but its mostly oaks
and
how beautiful
and its pretty flat there
its kind of hilly
but its low hills
its not
ive only been to $unc$texas once
i have $unc$two sisters in $unc$texas now $unc$one in $unc$austin $unc$one in $unc$dallas
and the $unc$one in $unc$dallas is the $unc$one that got me to doing this
yeah
and i thought $unc$austin was beautiful
you
i liked the hills and the trees
yeah
in $unc$aus-
yeah
its really different because thats the chalk hills down there limestone hills
and youve always lived in $unc$texas have you
yeah
except for time in service
uh-huh
born and raised $unc$texan
yeah
i had never been there
thats pretty neat
my sisters both seem to like it pretty well
my brother-in-law works for the university in $unc$dallas
at which $unc$one
hes admissions director
$unc$university of $unc$texas in $unc$dallas
okay
yeah
its just north of me here
yeah
hes got a job there
and this is his first year
so its been a real interesting thing for them
thats great
but they seem to like it okay
i think theyre too far away from me
but maybe some day they can get closer
yeah
well see
pretty good trip
so what kind of hobbies are you in
im mother of $unc$four
so basically im just real busy with my kids right now in sports
and we have a little $unc$halloween talent show tonight
and i substitute at the schools part-time
thats great
i am a travel agent at heart
and my hobby is just
i love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more
but its real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have $unc$four children and a husband
so i reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
no kidding
so ive been librarian all this week which has been real interesting
and im enjoying it
im around my kids
thats pretty easy substituting isnt it
yeah
its great
its great
and what else do i do
i do lots of cross stitching when i have time
ooh
and i enter things in our little state fair
and thats pretty fun
thats great
but actually my hobbies mostly is my sports tennis
i play tennis
i love tennis too
ooh
do you
and i ski
do you ski
yes
we snow ski
we snow ski at $unc$mount $unc$bachelor mostly in oregon
thats great
have you ever been there
no
wonderful place
ive skied in $unc$colorado
and we usually go to $unc$new $unc$mexico because its a little cheaper
ooh
uh-huh
where in $unc$colorado
ive been to $unc$telluride which is on the west side and $unc$copper
yes
yes
$unc$copper is kind of my favorite up there $unc$breckenridge and $unc$keystone
really
uh-huh
i guess those are the only places ive skied up there
i would love
i can hardly wait to get up there
me too
are you guys getting snow
we
it is snowing right now
were to get $unc$one to $unc$three inches tonight
gee
i heard $unc$aspen got $unc$three feet
yeah
we are on the dry side of the mountains
$unc$seattle is only about $unc$two and a half hours
so of course im a real $unc$seahawks fan
yeah
and going over that pass is just a real nightmare
i can imagine my lord
and were on the colder side
theyre on the rainy side
were on the snowy side
and we ski
my children all ski
super
and we have been to $unc$whistler in $unc$canada which is just a marvelous place
$unc$whistler and $unc$black $unc$home is in $unc$canada
and then weve gone to $unc$sun $unc$valley several times
thats just a great place but not in $unc$colorado
since i went to school
what about $unc$utah
havent been there
i keep hearing these marvelous things about $unc$deer $unc$valley and
yeah
havent either
dont $unc$adam $unc$city
always want to go to $unc$canada to $unc$banff or somewhere like that
yes
and your kids all ski
not all of them
uh-huh
my kids are all grown
uh-huh
but my youngest son is a skier
really
thats great
my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death
uh-huh
when theyre skiing theyre fearless
and they go off
okay
when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank
i thought i havent taken anything back for a long time
i havent either
i hate returning things
yeah
i have a friend who if she likes something isnt sure what size somebody might need will buy it in every color and size and take everything back again
yeah
its a game to her
but i do not like to do that
i consider it kind of a waste of my time
and so im usually pretty careful when i shop
uh-huh
and i also usually have checked over things if its like an appliance or something to make sure it has the features in it that i want
right
now weve had $unc$one lately a $unc$dustbuster $unc$plus that we bought
uh-huh
and weve had it for a while
but all of a sudden it just wasnt working
and it looks like theres a part missing from it
my husband opened it up and whatever
and of course we dont have the receipt any more
so we cant take it back
of course
uh-huh
but i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
right
right
just to get you by $unc$five years
and then youll throw it away rather than have it fixed
yeah
were a wasteful society for sure
thats true
and lot of times though it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another $unc$one if its
right
right
and you usually get what you pay for
we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for $unc$christmas
and they were $unc$ten dollars
and we expected them to work nice for the little kids
and they didnt work worth anything
uh-huh
we took those back
and thats about that
all that were taken back in ages
yeah
i think a lot of times if you get a brand name if its a good brand
yeah
i think there can be a lemon in anything but i think more often than not
right
you pretty well know what youre getting ahead of time
and if you buy a good $unc$one you shouldnt have too much of a problem with it
right
we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do
really
its hard
we never could get it declared a lemon
and the car would go
and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at $unc$sixty
and it would stop
wow
and i
there was just
and we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything
and they got it finally semifixed
but it was such a hassle
uh-huh
and it just pertained to that
yeah
yeah
it really is
but gee of all the topics i have had im doing this thing this is kind of the strangest one
at first i thought of food because thats mainly what i buy
it seems like
and i still dont have anything to do there
but i think too a lot of people dont buy their warranties either because they know that when its that old theyre going to buy a new $unc$one
uh-huh
so
i think thats true
and now we generally dont buy a warranty because you think at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
yeah
my husband is really good at fixing things too
so he usually be able to fix anything thats minor
and that has saved us thousands of dollars from to mechanic to anything like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it was interesting to
i dont know if theyre making them better or not
its hard to say
i think they more of their parts plastic which makes things break easier
but i think the technology is better
i think technology is better
im not sure
i think youve got a good point with the plastic and that
about quality
i dont think necessarily that things are being made better
right
i
everything is so automated
and things can be made without i think a human hand ever touching it an awful lot of things
yeah
yeah
and i think that certainly makes a difference back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and had some pride in it
right
people arent willing to pay those prices very often for a handcrafted something
so
yeah
thats true
so
so if we get what we deserve
yeah
i do craft work and sell stuff at shows
and its a real eye-opener as far as why people charge what they do to
you keep up with current events
somewhat
yeah
somewhat
not
not as well as i would like to probably
is that right
but thats the way it goes
yeah
whereabouts in $unc$pennsylvania
what
where in $unc$pennsylvania
$unc$state $unc$college
i go to $unc$penn $unc$state
do you
great
yep
hows
no
were not supposed to talk about that
were supposed to talk about current events
right
exactly
im a current event junkie
so i try to watch the news
and i read the newspaper
and i like to read $unc$time magazine and $unc$people magazine to keep up with whats going on in the world
i see
what particularly are you interested in
i just pretty little about everything
and then again not everything
uh-huh
but i like to know pretty well whats happening
political things dont interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to feel like i halfway vote intelligently
uh-huh
but other than that i just
just the events that happen around the world interest me stay in touch with it and feel like i know whats going on
yeah
now i have to say all $unc$three of my children none of them are too interested in current events
i see
but i always have been
uh-huh
and i stay up with it
but how do you stay aware of most of the current events newspaper t v news or what
some of both
uh-huh
i read the newspapers sometimes
uh-huh
and i watch $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n that sort of thing occasionally
right
yeah
thats good
and i read magazines and such
you stay up with it pretty well then
yeah
not that badly anyway
uh-huh
so i am interested in whats going on
and im particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about $unc$haiti recently because ive been down there
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
youve been there
and yeah
you would be interested in it then
right
exactly
yeah
i follow it
i dont just read everything about it
but im always aware of whats going on like that
yep
because its interesting
uh-huh
and i dont know
i feel sorry for those people down there
theyve just been so terribly mistreated for so many years through $unc$papa $unc$doc
thats true
theyve never really had a good leader
he was a terrible tyrant
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think its been better since he died
but its still been bad
yeah
but even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew
ive read some things about him that he wasnt too good himself
yeah
yeah
he was pretty much a
he didnt mind having people bumped off for certain things
uh-huh
but its $unc$one of the reasons the $unc$u $unc$s didnt do more than they did at the time because they werent all that excited about him although hes probably better than a lot of them
i see
uh-huh
but then again who
those people are so used to it
i guess its the only thing that works
yeah
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in $unc$america
i think its pretty darned good
i think were lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
uh-huh
i really do
sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme
the media does
but thats kind of understandable because of course if you watch it more than once a day its the same thing over and over and over and over
and i listen to the radio
right
right
so you hear so much
you get a little tired of it
but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe
yep
but i think the quality of our news is just i dont believe it could be better
uh-huh
i really dont
yeah
i think it always could be better
but i would agree that its pretty good
i dont think so
i dont think our news could be better
yeah
what else could they do to make it better
i dont see anything that they could do
yeah
i think that
i dont know
you always want to think everything can be improved upon
the
right
i understand what youre saying
right
i think that
but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as theyre going to get it
that may be so
yeah
nothing is perfect
i think that im not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such
uh-huh
thats true
i understand what youre saying
and then again i understand why they cant dig too much deeper
thats why we have $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
right
$unc$c $unc$n $unc$n has the time since thats all they do is news to dig deeper
uh-huh
right
i guess its a subject i havent thought too much about
i dont know if theres so much wrong with the public schools as much as were expecting too much out of them
that might be a lot to do with it
i know a lot of it here in my state
im from $unc$mississippi
im not sure where youre from
$unc$minnesota $unc$wisconsin
$unc$minnesota
okay
a lot of it in $unc$mississippi here has got to do with funding
yeah
problems with our educational system a lot of its due to money
uh-huh
and theyre trying to spend money where we dont have it
and theres a lot of things we need that we just cant afford
yeah
it is getting very expensive to run schools
so
it is
theyve got computers now that you got to train on
theres just so much more and less money to do it with
right
thats true
and a lot of it has to do with salaries too speaking of money
right
yeah
cause if you cant pay the right people theyre not going to get the people that can do a good job
yeah
yeah
i guess that in
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i think theyre expecting schools to discipline the kids
and i think it should go right back to the parents if you dont train your kids right then
right
right
i feel the same way
a lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home
right
yeah
and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids
theyve so severely limited
what disciplinary action you can do
yeah
yeah
i know when i was going to school it wasnt uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving
exactly
right
they do that now
and they could probably lose their job
lose their job and big lawsuit and all that
yeah
yeah
i feel thats got a lot to do with it
people arent as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be
right
right
yeah
it seems thatd be a subject that i dont have much to say on
really
weve talked some about it in my state because weve had a lot of prob-
our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education
but he wasnt
yeah
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly
i know a lot of
if you have more money its just logical that you can provide a better school system
uh-huh
and unfortunately theres not many places to get that money
yeah
then if you dont have qualified teachers in the different
i know $unc$one of my physics professors at college has addressed this
that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level arent scientists
theyre teachers
and they may not know a lot about what theyre teaching
where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses
and theyre trying to teach social studies
and they dont know a lot about that
right
where maybe a physics professor
my professor was a physics professor
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level
so therefore theyre teaching from a teachers point of view and not from a physicist point of view
and that causes a lot of trouble
right
yeah
i dont know
maybe they should sit back and kind of decide on where the moneys best spent
i know in a lot of cases different districts like to have nice fancy schools
right
and maybe they should be a little more concerned with paying the right people to teach and be satisfied with maybe a little older school
exactly
because here in the town i went to high school
there were $unc$four high schools in my county $unc$one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado
so when they rebuilt that school they had a top of the line high tech school there
uh-huh
and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
and then when the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building
and so it kind of would make you think that wed all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
yeah
yeah
i know where i came from we didnt have a very rich community
and high school that i went to was very old
and as far as i know its still there
theyve expanded on it
but theyve never built a new $unc$one
and its probably $unc$fifty $unc$sixty years old or better
and i dont foresee them building a new $unc$one for a long time because they cant afford it
right
exactly
okay
what do you think about the school system
i think theyre having a lot of trouble right now
i know my son goes to a private school
but i think big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now probably from budget cuts and everything else going on
why did you choose a private school
i had one that needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school
so he has been going to private since kindergarten
public school
has he
then how does he like it
hes loved it
he is a senior in high school this year
so hes
so hes been there all the time
yeah
hes done it the whole $unc$twelve and so many years
and its been really good for him
how big of a school is it
overall on campus about $unc$twelve $unc$hundred but in the upper $unc$four grades about $unc$four $unc$hundred and something
so its maybe a $unc$hundred per grade
a $unc$hundred per grade thats a good size
yeah
it really is
kind of gives them the
i get a little leery of the real small ones that they dont get much interaction with kids
but
yeah
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
and hes done really well
so they dont
thats good
and he was just ahead at an early age
and i didnt feel like what was available particularly in the first $unc$three grades
uh-huh
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out $unc$one day program
and i just didnt think that was going get it
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day but yet still be with his peers age wise
right
still enjoy the
right
$unc$one thing i think ive noticed is my oldest is in kindergarten
so im in a little different ballgame
youre just getting started
im just starting her
but seems to me that kids these days can really get away with murder
and the teachers arent respected as much
and they have to be so careful of the things they do and say
yeah
i know
thats a big problem
and makes me a little nervous that students dont seem to show that respect
and
we wouldnt have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school
no!
heavens
no
wouldnt have thought of it
and theyll stand there now with them toe to toe
no
you wouldnt
and
and the things they can say and do to a teacher they do from what i understand
i think thats wrong
i think we need to get back to show some respect
and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that
but
yeah
but a lot of times its not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions i dont think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases
right
for other people
and
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands
how do you think that thats happened
you think our societys just stopped talking out
or this generations just kind of changed a little bit
i guess i
the world changes
so obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be
right
theyre exposed to a whole lot more things
they have a whole lot more variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at $unc$one time
but still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach basic values and basic respectful of authority
right
and i just dont think that this doesnt always get emphasized anymore
that just isnt coming through is it
no
i remember it was a big thing when they let girls wear levis
we used to have to wear dresses
yeah
had to wear dresses didnt you
and then you had to go to dresses
they had to be a pantsuit
and it was polyester
and it had to be matching
and
and when it was skirts it was get down on the floor
and we hold the ruler up here
yes
and its no more than so many inches above the knee
exactly
yes
because it was mini skirt time back there at $unc$one time
yes
so its really changed
its really kind of gone the rounds
so i think that maybe thats effected it to some degree
they say you kind of act how youre dressed a little bit
so i
yeah
i think that probably does have something to do with it
and its also
does this school your son goes to do they require to wear a uniform
or
no
they do not do uniforms although $unc$one where he was between second and eighth grade did
uh-huh
yeah
there are quite a few of your s-
okay
yeah
considering you moved here from $unc$california i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there
yeah
we have in $unc$california
i lived in central $unc$california
we have rain couple times a year
and other than that it would be maybe $unc$october and then in the spring
and then other than that there wouldnt be any rain
especially the last few years
yeah
yeah
its kind of been a drought out there hasnt it
yeah
there has
here i know that last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state
and im glad to see there havent been any this year
yet
yeah
yet
still could come
huh
generally if were going to get them its not going to happen prior to $unc$january $unc$one
uh-huh
you may get a cold snap or $unc$two or some rain or something like weve been getting in $unc$december
but usually the bitterest weather if were going to have any comes in $unc$january and $unc$february
yeah
then by $unc$march things are getting warm again
so we really dont have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
yeah
yeah
its so hard to predict here
its been $unc$eighty degrees on $unc$christmas day here before
yeah
lots of times
today its not bad out there
no
its nice
i just came in from outside
uh-huh
and its really pretty
its kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again
yeah
yeah
im a scoutmaster
and so i wind up going out camping with a bunch of boys at $unc$one time
and so its better for us if it hasnt been this totally wet before we go
uh-huh
yeah
so you do that even in $unc$january
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
we camp year round
yeah
thats interesting
but its definitely different
uh-huh
and then i guess youve been through a couple of summers here too right
yeah
i have
and theyre not too pleasant
it gets so humid
to me its humid here
people that i know that come from $unc$georgia or $unc$north $unc$carolina they say its
it is
its not as humid as $unc$houston say or $unc$atlanta
but more humid than $unc$arizona
yeah
but i find it
and $unc$california for the most part
right
were you northern $unc$california
i was central $unc$california
central
central valley
its very dry there
yeah
yeah
its pretty hot in the summer
its in the usually
for a good $unc$three $unc$four weeks we have over a $unc$hundred degrees
but its a drier
but its a dry heat
$unc$hundred when you have a $unc$hundred here everybodys dying
uh-huh
yeah
i lived in $unc$africa for a couple years in cameroon
oh
and thats a tropical climate
and it really feels similar to this during the summer
what type of business takes you to those climates
or was that just vacation or something
no
i still work with $unc$wycliff $unc$bible $unc$translators
oh
its an organization where we are looking to translate the $unc$bible into languages of the world that arent yet written
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
right
languages that dont have anything written yet
so this is like the first thing thats written down
or first an alphabet is developed
oh
and then
thats interesting
you dont think about that as a normal career when youre thinking of things that people might be doing
yeah
yeah
its based here
the international headquarters for $unc$wycliff $unc$bible $unc$translators is right here in $unc$dallas
so youre with the home office now
yeah
right now i am
thats what brought me here
yeah
i think all in all there are a lot worse climates than $unc$dallas
the weather does change fast
yeah
and things do happen severely a few times a year
but theres an awful lot of good weather too in between
yeah
i agree
i agree
i thought the fall was really nice
yeah
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze
uh-huh
and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time i like that particularly if im going to be outdoors and doing outdoor activity hiking and things
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and thats nicer
yeah
you probably do a lot of that with scouting
yeah
i do quite a bit of that
uh-huh
think were going in just a couple of weeks out to east $unc$texas
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here
so i guess well
uh-huh
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains
uh-huh
theres not much between us and the $unc$north $unc$pole
yeah
and then when you get $unc$one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms
uh-huh
and then
okay
do you live in a home
yes
uh-huh
its a house we bought about $unc$two and a half years ago now
did you
uh-huh
uh-huh
first house
weve lived in ours for about $unc$six years
we had it built actually
uh-huh
and its our first home too
uh-huh
yeah
so what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody elses
before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in
uh-huh
and that was quite an experience
i much prefer having my own home and just the space and more privacy
uh-huh
yeah
is it a fairly large house
its $unc$twenty-four $unc$fifty square feet
thats pretty good size
yeah
its a $unc$two story
uh-huh
yeah
how about yours
its tiny
is it small
its not much bigger
we had an $unc$two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is
so
really
yeah
its only $unc$eleven $unc$hundred square feet
uh-huh
do you have children
just $unc$one
just $unc$one
yeah
but all the rooms are small
but it ends up giving us $unc$three bedrooms which we wanted and use an extra $unc$one for an office which is handy
uh-huh
yeah
id rather have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lots of space
but that ends up costing me
yeah
yeah
how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood
its a very very middle class neighborhood
lots of young couples with usu-
im sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood thats their first homes
uh-huh
and lots of kids and stuff
and so it fits well in the neighborhood
its certainly not a real upscale neighborhood
but on the other hand its clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want
yeah
yeah
is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood
yeah
it seems about probably average
or is it
uh-huh
but our neighborhood has just a wide variety of people
and theres older people here and people that are our age
were in our thirties
uh-huh
and theres a lot of kids
people across the street have $unc$eight
uh-huh
$unc$eight kids
uh-huh
my gosh
yeah
their home just burned down matter of fact last summer
ooh
and theyre just rebuilding
and their house is going to be really big
its
im sure with $unc$eight
gosh
yeah
theyre building a lot bigger
hes not an obstetrician an orthopedic surgeon
uh-huh
so since the house did burn theyre going
its quite different than it was before
and its a lot bigger
uh-huh
yeah
but ours is about
its a nice home
its definitely not $unc$one of the smaller ones
and its not the biggest either
but
yeah
new ones they tend to be real tiny especially in newer neighborhoods
my brother just built a new house
he lives in $unc$wichita $unc$kansas
and the neighborhood actually fought him on it
because the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
thats because hes doing a lot of it himself for example landscaping and lots of the other stuff
yeah
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood
but they were pretty touchy on it
yeah
you
he was a little surprised
thats interesting
you say that because we have those architectural codes here
uh-huh
and when we put out house in they wanted us to have
there was $unc$one
we have part siding on the $unc$two story part and then on the back
uh-huh
uh-huh
and there was $unc$one side where our chimney was
and just the chimney was going to be brick
and they wanted us to have more brick
so we ended up having to go halfway up
uh-huh
it does look nicer
and we would have like to have had all brick
but of course at that point we couldnt afford it
but its funny that youd say that because there were homes in here that didnt have any brick at all
right
so its kind of like they were
kind of depends on when they get in
yeah
yeah
and so it was kind of like they
ours is the last street that they built on
so the houses actually on our street theyre kind of gone a little bit nicer
they have
its gotten
yeah
yeah
just they
yeah
oh
its the second phase
uh-huh
and so theyve kind of changed the codes a little bit
and so thats kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didnt have any
my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in $unc$south $unc$austin
uh-huh
and what the builder apparently plans to do is they do phase $unc$one
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and stuff
and then they come back in
and then they sell
i spent $unc$four years as a university professor
really
and
yeah
i spent $unc$three years
im teaching in public schools and elementary school
do you really
uh-huh
thats great
i taught in $unc$utah
and did you teach in $unc$california
no kidding
w-
i did
uh-huh
i did
you sound pretty young for a university professor
i was pretty young
i was
i had never intended to do it
and i was given the opportunity after id started a management consulting firm to teach in $unc$one of the business schools in the $unc$california $unc$state $unc$university system
uh-huh
at any rate the topic is fascinating because $unc$one of the things ive done for the past few years is research the problem from the point of view of what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically
uh-huh
you may be familiar with cooperative learning
have you ever
you can tell me a little bit more about it because i dont think we did that in $unc$utah
the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools
and what it involves basically is the use of peer groups
and the teacher becomes a sort of a resource person to the learning cooperatives i guess theyre called
uh-huh
and there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people gain a competence with respect to the material
uh-huh
i think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn
i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
uh-huh
yeah
and both teachers and parents complain about the cost and ineffectiveness that results
my feeling is that the problem is significant
there are plenty of good people available to offer people educational experience
but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it
and i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly accelerate the pace of learning
uh-huh
and my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually
i dont know what form it will ultimately take
but i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that were paying an enormous price for inferior quality when the people involved really arent inferior
so it must be the way were managing the process that
yeah
i see what year saying
yeah
i totally agree
i dont think its a matter of talented people to do it both as quote unquote students and as teachers
but clearly whats happened in this country is the school systems been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past $unc$thirty years that werent existent
yeah
uh-huh
you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases
course i always see the
i dont know how hard is it in the public school system in $unc$iowa $unc$city
is it deteriorated a lot
do the people say
are they pretty happy with it
or
i havent taught in $unc$iowa
but ive taught in $unc$utah
and people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to where they taught their kids at home or anything but the public schools and the ones that did have the kids
right
even in $unc$utah
yeah
maybe it was the area i was in
utahs a place where you wouldnt think that problem would be very severe
but a lot of schools had a lot of transient families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side
and
yeah
so you saw a fair number of troubled kids
yeah
like you said how the schools are doing more things for the kids they thought than they were $unc$thirty years ago
the school i was teaching at the year i left they were considering providing or hot breakfast for the kids
yeah
yeah
as well as hot lunch
and
as far as im concerned its probably apt that your calls at this time because we just got through watching reasonable doubts which had a capital case in it
uh-huh
and i personally have
my own feelings about capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
i do too
mandatory summary execution on the steps that day
uh-huh
i think im in that same
i think if its a convicted felon on parole and he goes out and commits another crime or kills somebody i feel the same way
uh-huh
i think that person is beyond rehabilitation
and he should be taken out
i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
uh-huh
but i do know that almost all people usually die before that point
uh-huh
they just get too old
uh-huh
as far as capital punishment on its own merits i have the trouble with the way its applied
i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner
and ive said this very often
and i believe it to be a very true axiom
uh-huh
right
they will kill you
yeah
and if youre black and you kill a black guy its $unc$two $unc$hundred hours of community service
yeah
you dont hear too much of those cases
its a social disease that we have called $unc$one upsmanship
yeah
yeah
were the majority
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do
thats right
and youre the minority
and youre stuck with it
but we had this in the $unc$vietnam war
we had
population of blacks among military people in $unc$vietnam was about $unc$eighty percent
right
but the population of blacks in the military was about $unc$twenty-two percent
the handwritings on the wall there isnt it
yep
it sure is
but thats another issue altogether
yeah
its
as far as capital punishment i think that $unc$ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment
i think the guy should have $unc$ninety days
and if he cant produce evidence not argument but evidence
uh-huh
the only thing i dont understand i guess i dont understand our judicial system as it is right now
because if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution
how is there
that goes back to when $unc$america was a colony of $unc$england
uh-huh
in $unc$england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty judge said hes guilty kill him
there were some people that had a problem with that because they found out later on that a guy will lie rather than get killed
uh-huh
right
and hell say that guy did it not me
yeah
or hell have somebody lie for him
people lie
its a strange thing
yeah
but they do that
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the $unc$constitution a protection against judicial mishap
uh-huh
and the judicial mishap in this event would be you got the wrong guy
look at that guy at $unc$e $unc$systems
yep
they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
yeah
he was too far away when it happened
he had witnesses they werent dope dealers they werent drug fiends they were employees of an establishment that had a very high level of security sense too and these were really responsible people
and they convicted this guy because somebody says he looks like the right guy
they all look the same to me
yeah
big lips flat nose that was him
yep
what do you think about convicted
this is an unusual topic
what do you think about it
yeah
at first i
it took $unc$eight times to find you
so i told my husband
what should i say
and then he reminded me
but in his family what they usually do on his dads side his mom or the aunts will send out little postcards $unc$two or $unc$three weeks before reminding everyone where to meet and just to bring anything
and so they just notify everyone by mail
and then they just meet at a park or something to have a small dinner type thing
that sounds great $unc$ellen
how far away do they come from
they all meet in $unc$portland
and they come as far as $unc$seattle
and sometimes weve gone
and we were living in $unc$utah at the time
okay
and his dads family is all around the area
and his moms side of the family they all have their family reunions in southern $unc$utah
and people would come from $unc$seattle to there lets see $unc$nevada and in that area $unc$washington and $unc$nevada to southern $unc$utah
and each time they had a reunion theyd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody
okay
that makes sense
nobodys out of a lot of trouble more than once
yeah
yeah
and the people who are down there theyll assign $unc$one person in the $unc$utah area $unc$one person in the $unc$washington area
and that person can call beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too
uh-huh
and then they just sort of do a little program or something like that so that everyones sort of involved
yeah
thats interesting
you sound like youve had a lot of experience with this then
thats my husbands side and my family
we all live in southern $unc$california
so we just have to either or give a formal invite
and were all there
so
southern californias still pretty large
yeah
$unc$l $unc$a $unc$orange $unc$county area
everyones mostly not farther than an hour away
i see
yeah
my experience has been limited pretty much lately to my mothers side of the family
uh-huh
years ago there was a big dispute on my dads side
and they havent had a reunion since then
they just show up at funerals and weddings
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that
wow
but my mothers side we had our first real reunion that ive ever gone to last summer
and they had people come in from out of town
and they took some rooms down at a $unc$holiday $unc$inn
and they had some activity
they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
and a lot of that sort of thing
since it was the first $unc$one that wed had you could do that once
now next time we have $unc$one
well have to think of something more creative to do
thats interesting because $unc$one thing that always brings to my husbands mothers side together is they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
and inevitably everyone is just very interested
and they always have $unc$two or $unc$three new ones to add to the list someones been born or someone passed away or something like that
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever
do you have an interest in genealogy
i do but not very much compared to my mother-in-law
not a passion
i suspect well do quite a bit more genealogy
and i suspect we will do more of it
i found about some of the relatives i didnt even know their names some of the $unc$two or $unc$three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
and theres a lot of things there you have to stop
theyre really kind of fascinating
i found out my grandmother was $unc$one of a twin
and we dont even know where the twin
we have virtually no background on the twin
really
is it your grandmas own sibling
and she
my grandmothers sister who would be somewhere in $unc$west $unc$virginia
im sure shes dead now because my grandmother died about $unc$twenty years ago
i see
so
im probably a lot older than you are
maybe they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
i dont know
okay
what type of magazines do you have
we take several at home
i take $unc$skiing $unc$magazine
and i take $unc$discover magazine and also $unc$c $unc$d and $unc$stereo $unc$review and $unc$national $unc$geographic i think and $unc$boys $unc$life
uh-huh
good
thats a good one i like to get
so i take it that you like to ski
do you receive a lot of information on skiing through the $unc$ski $unc$magazine
i presume that i do
uh-huh
i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things during the year
oh
and do you receive discounts and things like that
do you think
or
not so much that i more likely to see those at a ski show or something
but i just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and new equipment thats come out and so forth
oh
some fashions are always in there too
oh
uh-huh
would this vacation youre taking
did you receive information from your skiing magazine
probably not
we already knew we wanted to take one
and we just started looking around
i may have referred to a couple of them
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to $unc$crested $unc$butte
oh
oh
we havent been there before
that sounds nice
kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one
uh-huh
its supposedly low lift lines
oh
but i havent skied $unc$utah yet
but i want to
you need to come out
id like to go to $unc$sundance and $unc$park $unc$city and some of those
uh-huh
i understand $unc$deer $unc$valley is nice too
$unc$deer $unc$valley
uh-huh
yeah
they are
its wonderful snow
how about you
what magazines do you have at home
i am currently taking $unc$decorative $unc$woodworking and $unc$country $unc$living
and lets see we do have $unc$national $unc$geographic
and then we have some church magazines
but i really enjoy the $unc$decorative $unc$woodworking
im heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that
so the $unc$decorative $unc$woodworking has just been a great great help
okay
does it have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth
uh-huh
uh-huh
mostly they have the ads on the equipment
but the whole magazine is just filled with pictures and projects that you can make yourself
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and then how to paint it with the tole paintings
and so its really a fun one
i like that
thats good
its good to get use out of $unc$one
uh-huh
im not sure that in the case of $unc$national $unc$geographic
i read it
but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time
uh-huh
but then eventually therell be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through $unc$forty-eight back issues to find $unc$france or something or whatever it is hes looking for
uh-huh
yeah
yes
ive noticed that too
but they have been nice to have around
every once in a while they come in handy
i used to take $unc$smithsonian too
oh
i liked that magazine
uh-huh
but i just found myself not ever getting around to reading it
oh
you get so many coming in
and by the time the next round comes in im still not through reading the first round
that
$unc$scientific $unc$american comes to our house too i forgot
and thats mostly my sons
oh
but i do read it too
uh-huh
that sounds like
and he takes $unc$game $unc$magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
he likes to try that
so he does get to be a lot of paper though
after a while if you dont keep them weeded out they almost take over
uh-huh
they can do that
i found that theyve been fun for my little girls
theyre $unc$five and $unc$four years old
and they like to go through
and
yeah
theyre just kind of getting started now
uh-huh they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on
and so weve found good use for those
mine is a senior in high school
so were kind of at the end of that trail
oh
youre just sort of beginning to think about first grade
oh
uh-huh
yeah
its fun
i do have a boy in junior high too
so
okay
so you got a little bit of a gap there between
so were kind of running the gamut
yeah
okay
do you do artistic painting
i do tole painting
you do
uh-huh
i really love the tole painting
i havent done any of the oil or watercolor
i would like to learn that someday
but right now my passion is tole painting
do you do a lot of it
uh-huh
i took $unc$one class about i guess $unc$three or $unc$four years ago
and ive done a little
oh
but it takes a lot of time
it does
it is real time consuming
and
do you sell your projects
mostly i have just given them away as gifts
uh-huh
ive done perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and on and on just things like that
but i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
uh-huh
where do you work at
i just work at $unc$stop and $unc$shop out there in $unc$ogden
so
do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique
no
ive wanted to do that but just havent mass produced enough to do that
uh-huh
i have $unc$five children of my own
so its
that keeps you busy
they keep me busy
and tole painting is just something i do in my spare time
so
uh-huh
have you tried any of the
do you cut out your own projects
yes
uh-huh
i have my own saws
and so i really enjoy doing that
do you ever spray your projects with a base coat first
or do you brush it on
i brush it on
yeah
i havent tried a spray varnish
i use just a wood sealer
uh-huh
yeah
i just bought a spray gun $unc$one of those high volume low pressure spray guns
uh-huh
and i do a lot of woodworking
and thats what i bought it for
do you
oh
but i havent used it yet
that ud probably give you a smoother finish wouldnt it
yeah
oh
yeah
what type of woodworking do you do
fine furniture
do you
yeah
thats why i bought the sprayer is to finish my projects
oh
thats my worst part of my woodworking
i get so sick of making
but its hard to finish it
yeah
but spraying does put on a nicer finish
that is interesting
what kind of equipment do you have
for woodworking
uh-huh
let me see
table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers
and about it
it sounds like youre really into it
that is nice
yeah
it is
yeah
i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
yeah
the band saw is really nice
i have an $unc$inca
i dont know if youve ever heard of those
oh
but its nice to have the right equipment
yeah
that makes it easier doesnt it
uh-huh
have you sold any of your furniture
or just
not
mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts
uh-huh
but making my own furniture
yeah
thats interesting
did you take classes to learn how to do that
just in junior high
uh-huh
and then i just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment kept up with that
so yours is mostly just a hobby too then
yeah
oh
yeah
that is interesting
i really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to
i dont know if i necessarily want to do furniture
but mostly just do more
the shelves and
uh-huh
the woodworking
for your tole painting
yeah
yeah
so its fun
good
i guess ill let you go now
they come on
were supposed to talk until they come on and tell us
they do
okay
so this is my first $unc$one
youre probably a veteran at this
yeah
it has been really fun
ive enjoyed this
like i say ive made a couple of calls to $unc$texas and just talked to all different kinds of people
uh-huh
so i think youll enjoy doing it
yeah
its fun
sounds fun
where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here
theres a shop in $unc$roy that i really love
and its there by the $unc$copper $unc$mill restaurant used to be the $unc$hayloft
i am not famil-
we live in $unc$roy
but we haven-
is it on $unc$nineteen $unc$hundred
uh-huh
lets see
im trying to think of the name
i know where $unc$fifty-six $unc$hundred south is
i dont right off
is that $unc$ben $unc$franklin then
$unc$ben $unc$franklin
okay
okay
so
yes
we started out keeping a budget about $unc$two years ago
we have a computer here at the house
uh-huh
and i made a $unc$lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
and then basically since then what ive done is keep track of it through the checkbook
so that based on the check coming in then how much im spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe-
because our house payment is once a month
thats our biggest expense
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck even thought its really still there so that i can keep good balance a running total through the month
uh-huh
uh-huh
a running total
yeah
what do you all do
weve taken how much we have write down how much we have coming in each month
and then weve
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend
we made up different accounts
weve set a budget for each household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our own fun money and just stuff like that
and then each time we spend something we write down in a book
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we
we try to stay within a certain budget
so
is it hard to keep track of it
or does it work out pretty well
it takes some dedication to do it
but it works out real well
so
and youre staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i have to stay within it
so i
and then we have that
if something comes up and you cant stay within it then we have a budget for we call our slush fund or something
and an unexpected comes up then you dont feel so strapped
you dont have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that
right
yeah
because we dont charge anything that we cant pay off by the end of the month
thats a good choice
were trying to do that this year
weve budgeted the money that we were spending on a $unc$coda account with $unc$t $unc$i and then money we were also buying stock with for that year
weve taken that this year and said were going to pay off all of our credit cards
youve got paper under your table
and we have another loan with the bank
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that well be free and clear
to be out of that
free
yeah
the only thing we have to pay off is a automobile loan and our house payment
and thats the only thing we ever
thats good to be in that kind of shape
we try to stay out of debt
what are you all trying to do long term
its long term
we just
his retirement plan and then to $unc$coda and stuff like that thats all we
and we just have our life insurance for right now
uh-huh
so we dont have any long term in stocks or anything like that right now
so
yeah
mostly what weve done the $unc$coda account with $unc$t $unc$i where we put in so much a month
or so much a pay check and then they match it
yeah
thats what were doing
so thats worked out pretty good
and then i used to work for $unc$t $unc$i
and i have
when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an i r a
and we had an existing i r a
so both of us have some money in an i r a that were also trying to figure
were putting it in c ds right now
uh-huh
and then were also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund
yeah
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a c d for a while
and then if we need it we wait until its expired
so
yeah
the other thing that weve done that was really nice to see we had $unc$one of the financial companies
$unc$john $unc$hancock company came out
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and what our goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house special thing buying land and building our own house
uh-huh
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time
uh-huh
or not
yeah
uh-huh
that sounds interesting
weve never done any-
we have
our life insurance guy has come out
and hes determined how much we need if something were to happen
yeah
thats the other financial thing i guess that weve done with our life insurance since im at home now is figuring out what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me
thats a big thing to think about
right
yeah
if i would sell the
if something would happen to him i wouldnt stay in $unc$texas
i would sell the house and move back home to my home town
and i wouldnt stay here in $unc$texas
so i dont know what he would do
okay
i guess thats most of my financial plans right now
yeah
mine too
is there anything youd like to add
no
thats about all for mine
its been nice talking to you
nice talking to you too
bye bye
bye bye
how do you usually keep up with current events
normally i listen to $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n or $unc$headline $unc$news about an hour a day
and then i supplement that with radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week and a newspaper if i have time
do you
yeah
i dont usually have time to read the newspaper everyday
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch $unc$one of the morning talk shows
and then i usually end up flipping through $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n and $unc$headline $unc$news during the evening
i always try to read the $unc$sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the weeks hot events
so i try to catch that if nothing else
thats true
and how do you rate the
are you pleased with the news coverage that youre receiving
for local news i think we do real well where its
we live in a kind of small town
but i think we get excellent local coverage
and i like the national news that we see
we watch $unc$n $unc$b $unc$c
and i think they do a real good job
so ive been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
how about you
on the whole im pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves since i dont necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
right
i think im fed up with trite
there seems to be more and more of it
and i understand the void that comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
and as expensive as they are to produce they certainly dont want any dead airspace
uh-huh
yeah
but i think theres enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us
and like you said save the commentaries because im going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions
i dont really need their help to do that
were certainly in agreement there
i dont think radio is as bad to do that as t v is
radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done
maybe theyre a little more efficient or have more to do over that same time frame
uh-huh
right
i dont know which that answer is
i think my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like $unc$sixty minutes
do you watch that
i used to
but i dont anymore maybe once or twice a year
i used to watch $unc$sixty minutes until they did $unc$two programs that i knew both the people and the incidences
uh-huh
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings
really
yes
and ever since that time i just dont watch
so i guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
yeah
i had heard a couple of people that i had talked to about certain programs say that they had read other things besides what $unc$sixty minutes presented and that they didnt present it nearly the same way as the news articles or whatever they had already been familiar with
so i started questioning just how bias they really were
so
i dont know how old you are
but it seems to me like the last newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was $unc$walter $unc$cronkite
so i dont know if youre familiar with him or not
no
not really
in the last few years just his kind of informal segments ive seen
but i never got to see his actual nightly news
i liked
i did grow up with $unc$david $unc$brinkley
$unc$brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold of $unc$cronkite
uh-huh
and he did a pretty good job
the $unc$huntley $unc$brinkley report was quite excellent over the years
yeah
we used to watch him and i guess $unc$john $unc$chancellor
and i always liked $unc$david $unc$brinkley
i used to enjoy $unc$john chancellors style of reporting
but on the nightly news he goes into his commentary
and thats where i get into the problem with him
i frequently disagree with his commentaries
so
once theyve reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
right
what did you think of the news coverage of the war
i almost felt like it was too much
indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day $unc$one in the morning and $unc$one in the evening
uh-huh
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
really
and i dont need their fill-ins
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your prior experience with the military did
yes
but i think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where were going
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on
i think my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with $unc$sixty minutes
okay
what weekly magazine do you look at
is it
i like $unc$u $unc$s $unc$news and $unc$world $unc$report
at $unc$one time or another ive taken them all for a year
uh-huh
i believe in giving anything a chance
sure
but i keep coming back to that $unc$one
so thats kind of my favorite
does that give a pretty good overview of everything
or does it give i guess little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories
its primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports
yeah
heres what went on in $unc$asia over the past week
and theres maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was the focus of their main stories
that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
it too is $unc$one those
in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom
right
and its $unc$one of those that i can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that im going to spend in there
right
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about $unc$three days
were working on a $unc$newsweek
for the last couple of months we got an introductory subscription
so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like $unc$glamour or $unc$sports $unc$illustrated
so we decided to try to bring $unc$one in that was a little bit better for us to speak
to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
it cant hurt
anytime that we stop and think it cant hurt
no
i enjoy reading $unc$t $unc$news
i try to catch it because its another example
they just show you the words and the facts
and they dont offer any commentary
and it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day because we dont listen to the radio at work at all
so i dont like to go the whole day without hearing anything
im with you
i have to check $unc$t $unc$news every day
its my noontime dose of facts
yeah
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is $unc$talking $unc$fingers
do you have that
no
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial
and then you dial in an access code
and depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you updated information
that can give you current news updates current weather updates things like that
and its offered through the local phone company free of charge
so thats an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
it does sound very interesting
it really is nice because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and find out about
maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for
i think its catching on throughout the country
how do you feel about it
i dont have any strong convictions about it
thats for sure
i know i havent done any $unc$peace $unc$corps service
and i dont know anybody in my immediate family that has ever even thought about it
do you know anybody thats been it
no
the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries
and thats only because i went to $unc$baylor
and a lot of students from $unc$baylor go and serve as missionaries during the summer
but i think thats a terrible idea
thats like forcing someone to donate to a charity
yeah
and its nice to try to teach young people some civil consciousness but forcing them to donate basically their time and efforts
yeah
its definitely up to the person
so id have to say that the people who do it some feel its rewarding
i dont know
but i dont know how we got the subject
you have to
i dont either
i have nothing to say about this
i dont either
i almost hung up because i thought gosh i dont really have an opinion except for no
i think thats dumb
uh-huh
but
how long you been in $unc$san $unc$antonio
ive been here for just almost $unc$four years
okay
and i lived with $unc$dana in school
okay
thats how we know each other
and you were just up there then
uh-huh
last weekend we went to $unc$six $unc$flags $unc$saturday
okay
had a good old time
thats good
back to the topic at hand
what other types of community service would they be talking about
the recording mentioned the $unc$peace $unc$corps
this is like major long term commitment a year or $unc$six months
yeah
so youre looking at the $unc$peace $unc$corps or sabbatical maybe
or i dont know
but
im all for donating my time to worthy causes
i do some volunteer work here and there
and every once in a while ill do a local $unc$big $unc$brother $unc$big $unc$sister thing
uh-huh
or ill go do a
but that time is minuscule compared to what they were referring to
yeah
yeah
i couldnt possibly commit a year or $unc$two of my life to go do something
yeah
yeah
they couldnt cover my hourly rate
i couldnt afford it
no kidding
but
i have this thing against bugs too
and seems to me like the $unc$peace $unc$corps
they send you someplace that theres a lot of bugs
yeah
$unc$africa
yeah
have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything
id probably catch a terrible disease and die
yeah
i doubt that
but you know how it is
it would have to be tough going somewhere you dont know the culture usually i guess
yeah
i think that maybe thats why some people do it is to see the other cultures and some of that
uh-huh
but to do that i dont know
id have to be
i dont know
i dont know either
growing up all i knew was you go to high school you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work
and none of this you go spend $unc$two years in the $unc$peace $unc$corps to broaden your horizons
uh-huh i know $unc$american $unc$express
im working at $unc$american $unc$express now
and they
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off $unc$six months or something for some type of sabbatical or something like that
uh-huh
and theyre allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
so it is something that i think even the larger organizations will support
its really for the community to give back to the community type of thing
i dont know
i think at the same its for some people to help them grow in other areas
kind of like joining the military
in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do
yeah
m-
and the $unc$peace $unc$corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time
yeah
maybe a little bit in that perspective
and a lot of people have gone in the military when theyre in the college
sometimes its to help support college the money
uh-huh
people dont know what they want to do
but as far as the $unc$peace $unc$corps i suppose theres a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
but i think a lot of its when people get older theyll do something like that
id probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the $unc$peace $unc$corps
yeah
but i dont
i dont
and none of my
didnt mean to cut you off there
thats okay
and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything
so i dont really know anyone first hand thats committed a chunk of their life to do service work
i
everybody i know has been
im going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car
so
yeah or try to make a living
yeah
but
yeah
i dont know anybody thats done that either
so i
its interesting we got this topic because i dont know what i marked off to get this
but
i certainly didnt mark off anything to get this $unc$one
i cant imagine
and the switchboards been down for several days
and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic
and i didnt feel like talking about it
so i hung up
and i guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
so you had the same $unc$one
yeah
youll get it over with here
i know
how many times have you talked
probably $unc$five or $unc$six
yeah
not a whole lot
ive done maybe $unc$four or $unc$five
yeah
did $unc$dana sign you up for this
she just sent me the information out
i got a hold of it
i just sent it back in
and
yeah
thats
she stuck my name on some list
so they mailed me the information that i filled out
what other topics have you had
ive talked about camping with someone
ive talked about the weather
great
great
that one was interesting because i talked to a man in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
and it was hot here
and it was snowing there
so that was pretty interesting
uh-huh
and i talked to someone about the education system
i forget exactly what the focus was on that $unc$one
but that was fairly interesting
and i talked to somebody about credit card usage
yeah
and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that she and her family just didnt have much
and they didnt have much credit available to them
uh-huh
and so she basically didnt use credit cards and didnt know very much about them and how they work and how you can use them to your advantage and how you can do certain things with them
yeah
i use everything with my $unc$visa
and i pay it all off
yeah
so thats a good deal for me
i get free money for $unc$thirty days
yeah
thats the way i use them
yeah
i try to make sure i dont get in debt
so
yeah
thats always a good plan
i cant think of anything else that ive talked about
most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and stuff that i would enjoy talking about
and i havent gotten a $unc$one of them yet when ive called
i had
lets see
ive had fishing
and i cant remember i think me and $unc$dana had football
yeah
we did
how funny
yeah
so we talked about the $unc$cowboys a little bit
and im out here in $unc$phoenix
so we talked about $unc$cardinals
uh-huh
so that $unc$one was all right
and then what else did i have
i think i had some other staying in shape or working out
i got this guy from $unc$new $unc$york
so
i had to talk to someone about hobbies
and the switchboard called me
so i was caught a little off guard
and i couldnt think of anything at all
so i started making stuff up
i told this woman that my hobby was gardening
and i cant even grow an ivy
and youve probably never gardened in your life
my grandfather gave me a plant once
and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill
you could freeze it
you could dry it out
no matter what you couldnt kill it
i killed it pretty quick
yeah
i dont have too much of a green thumb either
so
i do have $unc$one plant here
its been hanging out for a while
but i think its $unc$one of the easiest plants
i dont know the name of it
but im not too much into
where do you live
in the $unc$houston area
uh-huh
i used to
i lived there for a long time
but im now in $unc$palo $unc$alto $unc$california which is i think the recycling capital of the world
thats great
so we have many recycling activities
and im in full support of all of them
we are too
our community is just starting to get organized about it
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves
uh-huh
and it
thats something
but it seems to me that weve gotten a whole lot better cooperation out here by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra
i dont think we pay very much extra at all too
but the garbage men come by on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
uh-huh
i think thats great
theres a few places in $unc$houston where theyre trying that out
i dont know if theyve done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded bags and bins
yeah
we have burlap sacks
oh
and they give us $unc$one for aluminum and steel $unc$one for metals and $unc$one for glass
uh-huh
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags
so we leave $unc$three little piles that they need out on the curb every $unc$thursday
and the garbage men come by and collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if theyre still in good shape
thats great
and it really pays for itself because then the city gets the money from the recycling
uh-huh
yeah
were all for it
our
weve got several bins in our garage where we sort things out and take it to the appropriate places
yeah
the $unc$one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines
but they claim that because of the way theyre bound its too expensive to recycle them
at my office we have $unc$two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail
yes
and theyre
ones for white paper
and ones for colored paper
so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or things like that goes in those boxes
uh-huh
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines
and theres no way to get rid of them
it just seems like such a waste
it does
it does
but im sure that they can find some sort of use for them if there
ive seen talk about using garbage for energy
uh-huh
and so you could also apply the magazines toward that
that would be a help
i wish they would do that here
we have got so little landfill space left that were going to run out before the end of this decade
yes
and its really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things
i know it
we did have another novel experiment start this year
now we can put all our yard clippings out
oh
you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags
theyre about four-feet high
uh-huh
and you get them for i think its about $unc$fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you usually buy them by the dozen
uh-huh
and then you put all your yard clippings and leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
uh-huh
and the garbage men also pick those up on $unc$thursdays
thats great
and then they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing
and at the end of every year they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds
right
thats a great idea
i wish or that our city was that involved in recycling like that
yeah
because ive talked to many people
and we wouldnt mind going its extra effort to do it
if they make it so that its not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would
yeah
yeah
and i dont mind
at first it was the little extra money that you got returning the cans in and stuff like that
right
but i dont mind as long as things are getting recycled that we dont get reimbursed
no
i think its to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up then to get that $unc$two cents when you take it to the store
uh-huh
i know it
we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans for cash
uh-huh
but so few people have enough to make that worthwhile youd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back
right
yes
plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
do the grocery stores in $unc$houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
we have
i know the $unc$one that we use has recycling for the bags
uh-huh
and theyre promoting the cloth bags the reusable cloth bags
yeah
we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
thats great
they just take it off like they do a coupon
they can just subtract it from your bill
oh
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags
uh-huh
and they say as long as its clean they dont want a plastic bag thats full of goop
yes
here they dont want your rotted tomatoes
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag
so i keep
and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that were saving it to recycle
so right outside the back door ive got the $unc$two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
uh-huh
and there right outside that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
and now weve got the bag for the plastic bags
i understand
my husband about once a weekend hell go to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
yeah
and hell go pick them up because he just cant stand that
he
how nice
thats great
and its so
we have all our piles of recyclables also
uh-huh
i remember at $unc$christmas the only thing that im
when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did was they provided a place for us to take our $unc$christmas trees for them to mulch for city use
uh-huh
yeah
thats
they just put all our $unc$christmas trees in the regular compost pickup
uh-huh
so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was $unc$three weeks after $unc$christmas
uh-huh
right
and otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse
it would have to be cut into four-foot lengths
so if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four-foot lengths
uh-huh
but otherwise they have to be in $unc$one of their paper bags
that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there
and they even picked up our $unc$styrofoam packing materials
the week after $unc$christmas they left a plastic bag on everybodys front doorknob with a little note on it saying were trying something new next week only if you have any of those little $unc$styrofoam peanuts that any of your $unc$christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling
uh-huh
uh-huh
and well take all of those back and try to recycle them
right
see thats $unc$one
but i
thats not going to be a regular feature
that was just a $unc$one time thing right after $unc$christmas
the
but something does need to be done about the $unc$styrofoam that
those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
yeah
they dont
they dont mash
no
they dont compress at all
and they stay forever
right
and ive seen where some places have taken a plastic and theyre recycling them into other plastics and the $unc$styrofoam also into insulation and things like that
uh-huh
and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines
yeah
i do too
the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile
they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
right
because otherwise theyre not going to go house-to-house collecting it
and youre not going to bother if you have $unc$one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts
uh-huh
right
i was thinking about the $unc$styrofoam used at the fast-food restaurants that if everybody
yeah
and so
yeah
i know our cafeteria here uses a lot of $unc$styrofoam
but
now we quit that about $unc$three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody
and the only difficulty with that is that were in the middle of a five-year drought
and so its a real difficult choice whether we want $unc$styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or china cups to use up our water
but at the moment were using the china cups
and everybody gets $unc$one at the beginning of the year
and then your supposed to keep it recycled every day
thats good
thats a
yeah
they should last awhile
let us hope that everybodys going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get better reuse of things
because
i believe we are
i have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
yep
and so it will be good in the long run
it sure will
i enjoyed it
good to talk
yeah
the question was what kind of books do you read for entertainment i guess
i just read for escape
okay
its
with $unc$two little kids i can understand that
yes
thats simple
i read to escape
and i dont read any $unc$parents magazines either
so
what kind of
i just finished $unc$one last night a great book
its very typical for my reading though but a great book $unc$one called the things they carried by $unc$tim $unc$obrien
and its
god
i dont know if i would call it a collection of $unc$vietnam war stories or if id call it a collection of $unc$vietnam love stories
oh
strange book beautifully written
uh-huh
just beautifully written
by somebody who was there
or
yeah
a guy who was there as a foot soldier
uh-huh
so he considered himself to be a true $unc$vietnam soldier
yeah
any of the guys that were ground
yes
yeah
i can imagine
yeah
whats the latest $unc$one youve read
i tell you what
im kind of a history nut
im trying to think back now
i read an awful lot of periodicals and almost what you call reference books
uh-huh
and im embarrassed to say the last honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot right offhand i tried to read $unc$one of the $unc$michener lone star or the $unc$texas history book
i have never been able to make it through any of micheners work
ive had similar problems
it does tend to
are you a $unc$civil $unc$war buff at all
yeah as a matter of fact
yeah
because i finished $unc$one
i think this is $unc$two years ago
and somebody had given me $unc$one of these dinky do crappy womens novels set in the $unc$civil $unc$war $unc$john $unc$jakes with
yeah
and the novel didnt do that much for me
but the period of time was fascinating
uh-huh
so i then read was it battle cry of freedom
uh-huh
or
yeah
i think it was battle cry of freedom
battle cry of freedom
its kind of like a historical compendium of the $unc$civil $unc$war
yeah
and its not a story of the $unc$civil $unc$war
its a story of all the politics and lobbying and just basically state by state events that lead to the events that brought about the $unc$civil $unc$war
uh-huh
and its fascinating because i had always been raised on this $unc$proclamation with the $unc$civil $unc$war
uh-huh
there was a lot more to it than that werent there
there was a lot more to it than that
as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought
yeah
it was a political move
yeah
it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas in rebellion against the $unc$united $unc$states
all the other areas which i think at that time would have included $unc$west $unc$virginia and may have been $unc$kentucky a few states that were not part of the $unc$south but still had slaves
uh-huh
they didnt emancipate them
you know what else really surprised me now
im married to a native $unc$texan
and im not
uh-huh
ive got the same problem
yeah
im glad you put it that way
and i have $unc$two native texan children too
yeah
my husband is always talked about $unc$texas being a rebel state
uh-huh
and my god all this $unc$civil $unc$war pride
i kept waiting for
wheres some reference to this goddamn state of $unc$texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the $unc$civil $unc$war
mayb-
isnt much there was there
they might as well have not even been there
right
they werent a state
and the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to whos going to be going there
and i keep telling my husband that
and he keeps saying no
i thought okay
they supplied some
they were some groups of it the $unc$vicksburg
if you ever get a chance to go over to $unc$vicksburg the battleground at $unc$vicksburg theres an area there was some $unc$texas groups
and they had an interesting time there
ill bet they did
and down there at $unc$sabine $unc$pass i cant think of the guys name
but just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole $unc$union navy for a while from coming up the $unc$sabine $unc$river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story
why they actually held them off
none of the $unc$yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar
that could be it
you didnt hear me say that
outside of
and then the last $unc$civil $unc$war battle was fought at $unc$val $unc$verde
over there on the $unc$texas border you had a lot of groups heading for $unc$mexico
and they were cut off at the pass more or less at $unc$eagle $unc$pass
and they didnt get across the river there
so theyre the last
and that was actually after the war was over
but it was the last organized battle between the $unc$two units was in $unc$texas
yeah
so
oh
yeah
$unc$texas participation in the $unc$civil $unc$war was minor at
its been
boy
dont tell that to a native $unc$texan though
yeah
my god they fought and won the whole thing
yeah
my wifes from $unc$galveston
so
oh
yeah
im from $unc$new $unc$mexico
so i was
thats a beautiful state
thats a beautiful state
see i was raised in the midwest which we didnt even know where the $unc$mason $unc$dixon $unc$line was
uh-huh
and besides if corn didnt grow there it didnt matter
it sounds like $unc$iowa or something
$unc$iowa and $unc$nebraska
uh-huh
yep
and then i had probably lived the last $unc$eleven years in $unc$massachusetts
so what does that make me an honorary $unc$yankee
uh-huh
or $unc$god knows what
yeah
on
yeah
my sisters living in $unc$illinois right now
so
then shes going to come out well rounded
yeah
but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that ive really gotten into reading
and i think this is because the kids are getting to me is science fiction
uh-huh
ive always kind of enjoyed it
i used to read a lot more than i do now
ive gone to the point where my husband travels i get out $unc$two or $unc$three books
uh-huh
and im trying to think of $unc$isaac $unc$asimov robot series
yeah
i think ive read all $unc$four of them
and i understand that theres a fifth
uh-huh
in the last $unc$six weeks hes been on the road a lot
i just turned around and looked at my bookcase up here
and i see armageddon up there
and the shadow of blooming grove and $unc$two $unc$thousand and $unc$ten and $unc$grant takes command and the war in the year space that was the $unc$one i was trying to wade through was space $unc$james $unc$michener didnt get very far on that
i think i read $unc$hawaii when i was about $unc$ten years old
yeah
so
yeah
which is about the developmental level that you need to be at to read those things
and even then i was so disgusted with it i tried to read i dont remember which other $unc$one it was
whatever $unc$one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
yeah
and i got about a $unc$hundred pages through it and realized i had a $unc$thousand more
i thought i cant do this
yeah
it really
the books are kind of imposing to say the least
yeah
no
lets see
heres $unc$one called ghost towns and mining camps of $unc$new $unc$mexico
not too many people have read that $unc$one
i dont think
no
and theres the history of $unc$yoakum county $unc$texas there
ive got
is that a big thick book
yeah
and ive got a history of $unc$kingsley $unc$iowa
what the hell for
why $unc$kingsley $unc$iowa
because thats where my folks all came from
okay
and they had a centennial here awhile back
i read the $unc$grant takes command
that was pretty good
that was part of that trilogy that $unc$bruce $unc$canton did
now thats $unc$one
i dont know
i had never really been into science fiction that much until somebody gave me mist of $unc$avalon probably about $unc$five or $unc$six years ago
yeah
i dont know if id call it science fiction or fantasy
sometimes its awful hard
some of those get very philosophical
they can be in any setting
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting
the
i loved that novel
and then somebody said god this would have been even long ago because i was in $unc$boston
and it was raining all night
and i had a hole in my roof
and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and i was reading dune which seeming rather ironic
oh
yeah
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out ten-gallon buckets of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
uh-huh
youre reading dune
and i think thats probably my favorite of any piece of science fiction that ive ever read
that was a movie too wasnt it
and the movie was awful
was it
yes
it was just terrible
yeah
i didnt see it
but
yeah
it was beyond
$unc$patrick $unc$stewart was in that
i guess the guy thats on the new star trek series was in that thing
i dont know
i just remember $unc$sting was in it
really
yeah
and if you were trying to follow any type of plot it total-
even having read the book and ive read that book probably $unc$three times watching that movie i couldnt figure out what they were talking about at all
uh-huh
couldnt
yeah
i was real disappointed in that
ill tell you another good book
do you like scary things
some history books are pretty scary
have you
but
yeah
thats true
have you read the silence of the lambs
no
somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing theyd ever seen
oh
they didnt sleep all night
i am debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book
yeah
the book is chilling
yeah
i have
just chilling
no
i dont have the foggiest notion what its about
so
then i wont tell you
okay
yeah
but
its just that if youre ever really want to just be scared out of your wits
uh-huh
thats the $unc$one
thats the $unc$one
yes
even better than jaws and some of that
yes
because the character that is so horrible is another human being
and youre just drawn into his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
yeah
oh
a $unc$freddy $unc$kruger type
no
no
this guys smart
and hes suave
and hes all the characteristics
the worst kind
yeah
yeah
yeah
all the characteristics
okay
all right
i understand that its being proposed as a requirement for young people to go into public service
uh-huh
i think
yes
all young $unc$americans they did not specify exactly what young means
yeah
yeah
i think that it probably would be a good program
i think probably $unc$two years is too long
yeah
i think maybe a year would be the longest
yeah
yeah
youre probably right
$unc$two years might be a little too long
yeah
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i dont think that theyre going to be serving anybody
thats right
that would be the problem sure would
yeah
so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who arent even aware that they can do such a thing to get out there and do so
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
or maybe offer them some sort of an incentive to do it college credit something
yeah
right
im not sure what
but
right
college credit is a good idea because
im not sure they need to be paid
a super do salary of any kind
right
but that kind of takes away from public service
thats right
yeah
they probably couldnt do anything monetary
but i think giving some kind of college credit
but just to receive a letter in the mail that says you need to report somewhere by next $unc$monday
im not sure that would be a terrifically good idea
no
i dont think so either because a lot of people depending on how the public service programs are set up
and im not that familiar with them to know
im not either really
but if a lot of people flat cant afford to
thats right
thats right
and most kids these days have gotten themselves into financial situations where they have to be working all the time
uh-huh
thats right
absolutely
they need young families whatever
so its a really tough question
thats right
they just couldnt take off to do that
yeah
oh
and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that postpones their college for a year
thats right
uh-huh
and that would upset a lot of people too because they just want to get on
uh-huh
it sure would
it would have to be a lot of thought given to something like that i would think
yeah
i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
uh-huh
but i think it cant be something thats mandatory
yeah
yeah
it has to be something thats voluntary which is pretty much the way it is now
they might
thats right
im not even really sure at this point in time what programs are out there
yeah
and thats the other thing is that instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and go to the schools and do programs and tell them that we need your help and volunteer for such and such a time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and youve a choice of where you want to go
yeah
and handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
yeah
like maybe if there was something they could do in their own town or city and not have to pull up roots and go somewhere half way around the world or something
yeah
in their own community
right
yeah
thats true
most of them probably wouldnt do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
thats right
yeah
thats true too
thats true too
but they would have to be supported in some way
and im not sure that those programs are available to do that
yeah
yeah
me neither
and you wonder what kind of quality job would they do just sit around for their year
right
or would they really make a contribution of some kind
right
exactly
yeah
its tough
its tough
yeah
it is tough
its
and i dont know whos even proposing it or how they plan on implementing it if they do
yeah
yeah
im not sure either
but i think there would have to be a lot more information disseminated before you say lets do this
yeah
yeah
i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them
yeah
it be
it would take up more time than anything
but it wouldnt take up a lot of money
yeah
they wouldnt have to spend money advertising and things like that
yeah
thats right
you go to school
and you have a kind of a captive audience
get them all in the auditorium
yeah
and you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
uh-huh
and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded
right
but they dont know where to go to do anything
thats right
yeah
thats a real waste too
it really is
yeah
it is
it really is
i dont really see the emphasis on things like $unc$peace $unc$corps we saw back i guess in the $unc$carter administration
right
that was a big thing with him
yeah
yeah
and as a matter of fact i guess $unc$kennedy may be the $unc$one that actually started the thing or was really interested in things like that
uh-huh
i just dont hear much about it anymore
like i say i dont even know what programs are even ongoing now
i dont either
thats $unc$one
anyway its a tough question
yeah
it is a tough question
okay
thanks for your time
i enjoyed talking to you
sure
same here
okay
take care
you too
bye-bye
bye
how about you
do you use p c
constantly
yeah
you and me both
it seems everything i do is computer related
huh-uh
and if it goes down then were stuck all day
yeah
and so i like the $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m p c personally
huh-uh
but thats pretty much everything ive worked with
and ive become so accustomed to it that its second nature
yeah
what do you use
i have an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$p $unc$s $unc$two model $unc$thirty
yeah
its kind of getting too slow for me
but im an $unc$e $unc$d $unc$p auditor
so i audit computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level
huh-uh
and i use my personal computer constantly
not only do i do p c type things like using $unc$lotus or word processors
huh-uh
i also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
huh-uh
okay
so all i have on my desk is my p c
but im getting not only our local area network
but im getting $unc$two separate mainframe machines also
okay
so we use an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$p $unc$s $unc$two also
huh-uh
and every now and then the file gets so big that it moves slower than id like
huh-uh
but i do mainly graphic work on it and a little bit of word processing and then $unc$lotus applications to it
huh-uh
yeah
and i dont know
i enjoy working with them
yeah
theres so many capabilities out there
the things you can do are endless
yeah
ive become kind of the p c guru in our audit department because its mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
huh-uh
and theres $unc$three of us $unc$e $unc$d $unc$p auditors
and $unc$one of the $unc$three of us has an accounting background
and so shes not real proficient in p cs
and the other just has not used p cs that much
yeah
so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what theyre doing
and im the administrator for our local area network
and i need to keep that going
and so i couldnt live my life without a p c
huh-uh
i dont have $unc$one at home
we have $unc$one at home
but i just dont find the time that i can use it
yeah
right now i would rather not have $unc$one at home because i would work at home
yes
weve got a couple of portable lap top p cs at the office that i end up bringing $unc$one of them home a lot to do work
huh-uh
if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night
$unc$one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave
they didnt know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
yeah
huh-uh
so they didnt know how it was going to work
they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could make it through this $unc$eight weeks or so
yeah
but its almost like we could become too dependent on them
yeah
and we use a lot of free lance
huh-uh
and thats pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
yeah
and it
compared to the way the things have really
right
whats the word im looking for
im just totally drawing a blank
but the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great
its remarkable the things we can do now and compared to a few years just the power
yeah
im trying to get an updated machine
mine is just putting along
and its not fast enough for a new $unc$four $unc$eighty $unc$six chip
but i dont know if my boss will spring for it
yeah
but im determined to brake mine
so he has to get me another $unc$one
we think about that a lot
yeah
thats what i do
we had a printer a $unc$hewlett $unc$packard $unc$ready $unc$writer
huh-uh
and we had about $unc$ten people sharing this printer
it was attached to a central p c
and you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something
now thats awful
so the first thing when i started working at this bank is i said now first of all we need to all be able to share this p c without getting up
so i talked my boss into investing in a real elaborate local area network
huh-uh
but we can share the printer
and we can send files to each other
okay
and we can send mail messages to each other which is good enough
okay
its what we need
right
and then i talked them into buying a $unc$h $unc$p $unc$laser $unc$jet
yes
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it
but once he bought it he has been so pleased
its fast
its quite
it has good copy
right
the copy that you can with $unc$one of those as compared to $unc$one of those dot matrix printers
yeah
ive got a little $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$pro $unc$printer on my desk
yeah
and i can use either the $unc$pro $unc$printer
or ive got my p c configured to where i can use either printer the $unc$one thats on the network or my own
huh-uh
so if i just need something real quick i dont feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed
i can just print it in my office
were just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
yeah
and its just so
the budget restraints and things like that makes it difficult
and
they have gotten really cheap
$unc$hewlett $unc$packard makes its actually a dot matrix printer
huh-uh
but the quality is almost laser quality
huh-uh
and i think its called the desk jet
and you understand i think theyre about $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars now
and we got a quote on some laser printers the other day at $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars
really
yeah
i dont remember what kind they were
but we do a lot of transparencies
huh-uh
sometimes the color would take too long to plot out
yeah
so they just want black and white which we can just run them through the laser printer real quick because it will only take a minute to print $unc$one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
yeah
yeah
but it
so thats all you need for charts and stuff
you dont need them in $unc$four colors
no
huh-uh
if it was a customer presentation then that would be different
yeah
we would want to razzle-dazzle a bit
but its
yeah
we have $unc$one in the office
and in our area if we want to use it like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if theyre not using the printer
you use the sneak- system
right
yeah
and wait for an opportunity to use it
yeah
youd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
huh-uh
until they got off the machine
i know
i know
i understand
that was
i was amazed when i came to work
i worked at the
it used to be the largest bank in $unc$san $unc$antonio until $unc$n $unc$c $unc$n $unc$b came up and bought the rival
and now $unc$n $unc$c $unc$n bs got a little larger market share
huh-uh
but its the only
its part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the $unc$ten largest banking holding companies in $unc$texas
its the only $unc$one thats still alive
huh-uh
i work in a big prestigious place
right
and i couldnt believe when i walked in the door on my first day and heres the audit department of this huge holding company sharing a $unc$h $unc$p $unc$rugged $unc$writer
i was going wait a minute
come on guys
this is crummy
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number $unc$one when youre behind the times in technology
yeah
yeah
were pushing real hard though
were trying
the entire bank is not like that
we
the bank philosophy is $unc$one of innovation and lead the market
huh-uh
its just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president over audits is cheap
huh-uh
and its real hard to pry money out of him to do these things
but i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
and
right
we find it hard to understand when we work for a computer company and how are we supposed to present the imagine that were supposed to present with equipment thats obsolete
yeah
and some of the guys that run this place are very tight
and its like why do we need this
cant you do that with what we have
and when we try and then they complain about this doesnt look good
yeah
unfortunately the computer equipment and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly
for instance we bought a
okay
okay
that made a nice ugly sound
so
your name is $unc$lynn
$unc$linda
$unc$linda
uh-huh
sounds like you like to read
yeah
i read quite a bit probably dont read as much as i would like to
i dont read as much as i would like to either
im a single mom
but i have always loved reading
uh-huh
what do you like to read
im a therapist by trade
so most of my books are i guess what youd call self improvement type of books
that what ive been reading lately a lot of
my interests switch around dramatically
i used to read just mainly fiction
and now like a said ive read a lot of self help books
uh-huh
what kind of things have you read
i read all kinds of things for helping people survive a divorce
uh-huh
the road less travelled was probably $unc$one of my favorites
have you read that
i havent gotten through it yet
you havent
no
okay
what would you recommend
as far as dealing with divorce
im kind of getting that $unc$one past me but a good self help book
good self help
yeah
probably the best $unc$one that i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance by $unc$robert $unc$mcgee
that sounds good
uh-huh
and its $unc$one that we use in our work
its probably $unc$one youd find in a christian book store
i dont know what the chains are down there maybe in the mall family book store something like that
uh-huh
im writing it down
thats sound really good
what kind of counseling do you do
or should we stay on the topic of books
probably should stay on the topic
but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read
im a therapist for $unc$rossa
its a christian treatment organization
oh
and because of that i work with adolescents specifically
so i see a lot of kids with various problems
right now some of the things im working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse
so a lot of the books ive been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
theyre at a bad stage anyway
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
uh-huh
that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that
sometimes its rewarding
and sometimes its a struggle
im sure
im sure
what oth-
is that just the only type of reading youve been doing
or have you read any good novels lately
i guess ive got so many books like that that i need to read
its hard for me to do a lot of reading just for enjoyment
just joy reading
yeah
i hear you there
thats for sure
in fact
i guess the last book ive read
my oldest daughter had to read lost horizons for her $unc$english class
uh-huh
and i just realized i had never read it growing up
so i just finished reading that for enjoyment
thats neat
and it was good
she didnt enjoy it much
so i didnt get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her
but i thought it was real interesting
yeah
ive always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college because i enjoyed some of those stories so much
uh-huh
but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading
i know
yeah
i trying to think of some of my other favorite books
but i keep lists
i must have a list of $unc$three $unc$hundred books that i want to read
uh-huh
just like i want to read that and i write it down
yeah
ive got a stack next to my bed
so do i
i tend to get a little bit of ways in a book
and then i get distracted and have to start on another $unc$one
its pretty tough to keep up with
i was trying to think of
ive got a copy of the road less travelled
but i was trying to think theres another $unc$scott book that ive got that i had read
he also wrote people of the lie
yeah
thats the $unc$one i was thinking of
yeah
i bought that one
and i didnt get involved in that $unc$one as well
theres another $unc$one he wrote that even sounds better
and its kind of the whole concept of global peace and building communities
uh-huh
someone just recently said something really neat about that
i got involved in $unc$beginning $unc$experience $unc$weekends
and it was of the people from there that said that
his latest book and i cant recall the name of it is just excellent
and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects
and he did mention $unc$beginning $unc$experience $unc$weekends as $unc$one of the places
so ive ha-
thats interesting
yeah
it really was
a real fun bunch of books that i read the beginning of last year were the author of $unc$jonathan $unc$livingston $unc$seagull
uh-huh
i cant think of his name
is it
pardon me
no
itll come to me
but he wrote the illusion and a bridge to forever
those are mind expanding books
his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of
i cant think of what his name is right off the bat though
but they were fun
they were real just books for fun
uh-huh
have you been involved on the switchboard long
not very long
i really just started
uh-huh
how did you get involved
my wife has been working for $unc$t $unc$i
i see
im a former $unc$t $unc$i-er
i just recently quit
and so i got myself involved in a sales job
and right now my list of books to be read have to do with the art of selling
uh-huh
i was just thinking at $unc$rossa
they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with
uh-huh
so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read
and i dont know when im going to get to them all
never
never
theres never going to be enough hours in the day
i dont think so
even if you took speed reading
yeah
i dont think so
so im trying to think of what other kind
do you like to read mysteries
yeah
a little bit
do you like $unc$ken
trying to think
he writes spy novels the eye of the needle
uh-huh
and i really have found his books enjoyable
i like that kind of stuff
i think the last novel i read i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year
it was a last names
its called this present darkness
its kind of unusual book
its a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that
that sounds interesting
it sounds really good
hey you should make yourself a promise that youll read $unc$one novel in the next $unc$six months just for you
uh-huh
its so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or self improvement
and you kind of forget the fun of reading
yeah
thats true
yeah
very easily
so
i guess weve covered the topic pretty thoroughly
i think so too
and i thank you for calling
yeah
nice talking to you $unc$linda
and ill have to check out that book you told me about
okay
great
okay
hope you like you it
thank you
uh-huh
you take care
you too
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay $unc$deanna
on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman
uh-huh
and i believe also in killing someone in the process of rape
uh-huh
and i dont really remember what else
uh-huh
but
what do you think about it
i think its justified
yeah
yeah
very much so
i agree
i
i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman
yeah
i do too
i do too
i think theyre doing their duty
but i think if theyre going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it
they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman
thats right
i agree
yeah
i agree
i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about i know what it was
it was our little $unc$lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week
theres a little thing at the bottom
its like a call in survey that says do you think so
and then you call this number
and you press $unc$one for yes and $unc$two for no
right
uh-huh
and $unc$one of the questions the other day this last paper and i havent seen the results of it im anxious to was do you think that capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers which i thought was a real interesting question
i think
right
right
did you see $unc$sixty minutes tonight by any chance
no
i didnt
huh-uh
they were showing a segment on a man in $unc$philadelphia thats going after the drug dealers
hes just a civilian
hes a black man
uh-huh
and he just got fed up with it
uh-huh
and he said hes had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen $unc$three times and everything trying to keep him quiet
uh-huh
but hes organizing people
and theyre going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory
i think thats what its going to take though
i think so
i think
i really do
yeah
its going to take
the police i dont think can do it alone
thats right
i think youre right
its going to take all of us getting together
im trying to
my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed
its going to take all of us getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more
right
we wont allow this in our neighborhood
thats right
thats right
and it said theyre going to other neighborhoods from there
uh-huh
and then quite often theyll get shot because theyre horning in on somebody elses territory
thats right
thats right
i think they said $unc$forty-one had been shot out of $unc$one church in the last year
my gosh
the only thing about the death penalty i know that they try to be careful
and they try to be sure
but these people are on death row for like $unc$twenty years
right
i know it
an-
if
i think being convicted is $unc$one thing
and thats great if theyre sentenced to death
to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure
it ha-
it goes all through the state supreme court system before theyre
right
right
by the time it gets there
and theyve been convicted
and then theyve been sentenced to death
theyre sure
theres no doubt
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind
uh-huh
then it should happen
yeah
there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty
thats right
so once theyve gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it
just
right
i guess that sounds cold
but gosh were keeping these men in prison for $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty years on death row and not doing anything with them
uh-huh
thats right
and its costing us a heck of a lot of money
and thats terrible to look at it that way
but
yeah
it is
i know
but thats the way it is
if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it
we had $unc$one in $unc$virginia that was sentenced to death
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago
i dont know if there was anything in your paper about it
i didnt notice it
huh-uh
and there was a lot of protest
even $unc$robert $unc$redford was protesting this guys execution
gosh
yeah
so the governor backed down
and i was so mad
man
his crime was just horrible
yeah
and those kind of people im sorry you dont reform them
no
i dont think
i really beli-
you dont
huh-uh
if theyre the kind of people that commit these grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you dont reform those kind of people
huh-uh
and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me
no
no
and i dont know
the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas
right
yeah
if youre insane enough that you can go cut $unc$twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then can you be helped
i have my doubts
thats right
yeah
yeah
i do too
i dont know
i think theres a point
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it just gets out of hand
right
and i understand that
my husband and i
wasnt it $unc$lewisburg that had a lot of bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks
or was it not
no
no
no
huh-uh
mayb-
i think it was the south east area from $unc$dallas
really
my daughter lives down in $unc$rowlett
yeah
and she was telling me about it
really
yeah
yeah
i cant remember what the town was some little area
weve had several here lately
and it
there were several of them in $unc$north $unc$dallas
and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in $unc$south $unc$dallas
and thats maybe what you were talking about
men breaking in to houses and or a man
they think its the same person taking little girls right straight out of their beds at night and breaking in obviously watching them in the house because theyre breaking into the right window the little girls bedroom and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards
gosh
and thats the last they se-
yeah
gee
is that right
yes
that is happened
i hadnt heard about that
i think theres been like $unc$six or $unc$seven of them over the last probably $unc$eight or $unc$nine months
gosh
they dont kill them
they just mo-
they dont kill them
no
gosh
theyve tak-
and theyre all anywhere from $unc$nine to $unc$twelve years old i think is what theyve been
gosh
and hes taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard
boy thats scary isnt it
can you imagine because it happens in the middle of the night
so these parents didnt know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in
yeah
boy
can you imagine
yeah
you wouldnt even dare put these little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire
have you seen those
ive got $unc$one of those in brians room
yeah
i never even thought about that
god maybe ill take it out
yeah
i hadnt even thought about it
thats terrible
yeah
it is
its really bad that you have to be
we were over at a neighbors tonight
and my little boy is just a little over $unc$two
and their little boy is $unc$five
so theres a big difference
uh-huh
and they were playing in the back yard
and we were getting ready to leave
and i went out in the back yard to get $unc$brian
and the boys were gone
and the back fence was open
gosh
gosh
yeah
and she didnt act like it bothered her at all
this happens all the time
and we walked through the fence out the alleys come to the back of the house
uh-huh
yeah
and i looked down both directions of the alley
and i saw neither $unc$one of them
and she was like god he does this all the time where are you screaming $unc$j $unc$d
oh
boy
and my heart was in my throat
and hes $unc$five
shoo i guess so
and $unc$brian was $unc$two houses down
gee
and he
i dont know
i know
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere
and i just cant do that
yeah
there was a little girl picked up in $unc$rowlett from her front yard
and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard
and somebody apparently drove up and took her
and they never saw her again
man this is too scary that is just too scary
yeah
i let $unc$brian play here in the back yard
and theres $unc$two gates that go into the back yard
and weve got $unc$one of those big $unc$eight foot privacy fences
right
uh-huh
and $unc$one of the gates has a padlock on it
and then the other gate just has $unc$one of those slide bar things
but its on the inside
uh-huh
its
theyd have to come over the fence
they could not open a gate
uh-huh
and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there
right
yeah
if i dont hear him playing i get up and come out and look out the window real often
so
and watch
yeah
yeah
i dont blame you
its really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids
but you do
uh-huh
better safe than sorry
and if they find whos doing that to those little girls as far as im concerned he could fry
he could fry
yes
to put it very bluntly he could fry
yeah
yes
yes
because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
right
yeah
and i believe that
and this is $unc$one of them
yeah
because these little girls will never be the same
huh-uh
thats terrible
never be the same
so i dont know
its really scary
and i dont know what needs to be done
it seems like theres no room in jails to put them in jail
and when they do put them in there
im taking a business law class at night
and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney
so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases
gosh
and he said youre not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to
theyre going to serve about a quarter
its going to be reduced
right
uh-huh
theyll serve a quarter of it
yeah
so if you want them to stay in prison for $unc$fifteen years dont sentence them to $unc$fifteen years sentence them to a $unc$hundred
yeah
because then theyll serve $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty which is really
yeah
i dont know
it just doesnt seem right
no
it doesnt
they just get out
there was a thing on
what are we going to do about it
how can it be changed unless the legislature will do something
i dont know
and they dont seem to
thats the thing
were just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude
uh-huh
and were going to have to say if you commit this crime and if were sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period period
yeah
and do it
yeah
and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life
right
were not going to say were going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in $unc$fifteen years
were really going to do it
its just the system has just
and i understand theyre doing it because the prisons are full
but somewhere weve got to come up with some money to build more and keep these people in them
right
i think so
yeah
i think it would be worth it everybody wo-
i was watching a show about this the other night
and they were i think it was on $unc$forty-eight hours
all right
there was a crime here in $unc$mckinney a rather heinous murder
uh-huh
there was no remorse shown by at least $unc$one of the perpetrators
uh-huh
and yet for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime
uh-huh
and quite honestly i feel very strongly that the man has no redeeming social values
and if and when he gets free again he will have no compunction but to continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again
uh-huh
so it really bothers me that theres not a way of getting him out of the way forever
really
i think that
i dont know
i dont think our prison system isnt set up where we rehabilitate or restore anybody
i think itll only make them worse
but i believe that $unc$god can come in and change a persons heart and genuinely change it
but that doesnt negate that you do reap what you sow
and if you do kill a person and youre found to be guilty i believe $unc$god establishes the authority of our court system
and i do believe that capital punishment is alternative
even $unc$god can still change your heart
but that doesnt mean
like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you get your life right with $unc$god
but you still have to pay your $unc$visa bill
thats right
you still have to
but $unc$god sent us his grace
and they give pardons
but i believe if its a genuine conversion theres a genuine
and those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a persons character
they see that
but
yeah
and i worked in a prison in $unc$fort $unc$worth
did you
yeah
i have a degree in social work
you see it the ones that have a genuine character change
uh-huh
it is obvious
and they know that
theyre not going to pardon someone from the governor
you know what im saying
theyre not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison
so i feel like there is occasions where they do spare lives
and i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be reelected
so
yes
but my concern is first of all that not all persons who i think should be receiving whatever capital punishment
uh-huh
punishment
thank you i just got home from work
and im just kind of spaced out a little bit
yeah
thats okay
that not all of them are being convicted of it that theyre not even being charged with that appropr-
i agree with you that a persons heart can be changed
uh-huh
but the same $unc$god that can work that miracle also established the laws that said for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment
uh-huh
right then it was almost immediate
uh-huh
as soon as the trial was over then it was stoning
right
but in the $unc$old $unc$testament
we dont have a speedy trial
we dont have speedy punishment
and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
uh-huh
yeah
right
we dont
yeah
we definitely have lost the judeo-christian ethic of the judicial system for sure
but the foundation is still there though of the system
but i know what youre saying
but also theyre under a law because we havent been removed from the law
weve just been taken out from under a law
because under the law if your child back talks you he would be stoned
thats correct
under the law he would be stoned
so weve been removed from being under the law
but were still accountable to it
we dont need to back talk
but its like $unc$god changes your heart to not do that
he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust
because in the $unc$old $unc$testament they could look all they wanted just couldnt do it
but in the new hes looking at your heart
and so i guess thats what i mean by their character changes and what i mean its like looking beyond what theyre doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart whats the character showing me here
and then any of
if i dont believe that theres not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder rape i even believe incest things that will permanently damage the character of the child
uh-huh
i believe crimes against children should be punished by death i believe sexual crimes unless theres a true change of character
i tend to agree on that very strongly
and thats where we just have to trust the authorities
and theyre not going to excuse people if it was run like that
i dont
there would probably be very few exceptions to that
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly
because the judicial system theyve rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
plus all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the civil things that clog the courts
right
uh-huh
and having sat on both criminal and a civil jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
uh-huh
yeah
because were suit happy
yeah
but back to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned
yeah
i would like to see some kind of streamlining so that if a person is convicted and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesnt do the criminal or the victims family any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
yeah
anybody
yeah
yeah
bu-
him could be a her
right
but
i think its $unc$jamaica i know that they have crimes punishable by death
and im sure they hit a few every now and then
and i wouldnt want to be $unc$one of them that are not guilty
but i know that they have their crime rate
its not $unc$jamaica
i dont think
i cant remember which
its $unc$one of the $unc$caribbean $unc$islands
and $unc$singapore is it like that
my husbands going $unc$singapore
and they dont have a lot of the crime because there is a law
and the law is enforced
and thats when you have lawlessness
the laws not being enforced
and all that does is lawlessness
we went on a mission trip to $unc$manhattan and to the $unc$bronx and stuff $unc$two years ago
and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack
and everyone was out
we were across from that big bus station
i forget what you call it
but and they had $unc$fifteen people lined up on the fence
and within $unc$two hours there were $unc$fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
and youd see the same kid who were back out there in $unc$two days
thats sad
because the answer is not being given to them in the court system
and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with $unc$god
and it was really an integral part
and no
you cant force people
but i think people are hurting
and theyre out doing crack sitting on the street
they were the kind of people that
i think mostly we would want to receive it
if it was presented to see
i dont know
i guess im kind of frustrated that weve gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon
it reeks of the $unc$bible just the whole system
and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon para-church ministry to come in and do it that the system itself
you know what i mean
yeah
i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
however certain very liberal minded groups who do not subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do such as the civil liberties unions and so forth will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side
right
right
yeah
yeah
because too often there can be extremism that hurts from any direction regardless of whatever youre arguing or concerned about
yeah
right
yeah
i know youre right
they would lobby that
and i see that
and thats why im like whats my role in this thing whats my part
yeah
because i dont think the system is going to get fixed
i think its crippled
okay
do you go camping very much
no
ive havent gone camping in years
but its is something that ive done in the past
how about you
we try to go once maybe twice a summer just for a short weekend or something
thats pretty average to me
we dont go for week long thing
uh-huh
but we usually go to a lake area where the campsites are and do that
right
do you tent camp
or do you have a camper
no
no
no
a tent
thats what i ha-
thats how i camp too
thats how i define camping
me too
youre really roughing it
the rest of that is really not the same
yeah
as a matter of fact the majority of the amount of camping ive done has been really roughing it
as a little girl id go with my dad and my uncle and my brother
and we went to the $unc$boundary $unc$waters area in $unc$minnesota
so thats really wild
oh
yeah
are you here in local $unc$texas
yes
im in $unc$austin
where are you
im in $unc$garland
oh
right outside of $unc$dallas
uh-huh
so we have a $unc$five year old
and she was pretty young when we started camping with her
the kids love it
i know
they just love it
its wonderful for them to be outside
i know
and they
theres no t v
and they dont have all these modern toys
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with
exactly
yes
and i like that
its pretty fun
how it
really is a good family thing to do
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and
we try to go with another couple that have children also
uh-huh
and that makes it a lot more enjoyable
plus we dont have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff
we kind of split it up
good planning
yeah
because it really does get expensive if you dont want to rough it all the way
exactly
even the sleeping bags those are running a good $unc$thirty dollars a pop
and so weve built that up
youre right
but
do you have a boat
no
no
want $unc$one bad
do you
what i would love
i would absolutely love a sail boat
oh
that doesnt go along with camping
but now thats what i would like to have
yes
yeah
i would too
yeah
would too
we usually
lets see
we try to go to a lake
my husband and this other couple that we go with her husband kind of likes is it scuba dive
and so well go to a lake where they can go do that
uh-huh
were close enough so they can do that
and the girls can play on the beach area
and i would play on the beach area too
yeah
thats what i would do
yeah
yeah
thats fun
im just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that
really
am i pretty texan
youre pretty texan
yes
but you know whats really funny
people tell me that i have a $unc$texas accent
and there is just no way ive not picked $unc$one up
no
you dont sound like it to me
ive only lived here about $unc$six years
have you
so if i have $unc$one it must be very very slight
yeah
the $unc$yankees can hear it
yes
thats true
thats true
i dont think i do
but a lot of people do say i sound like
i have i guess more of a twang to my voice
uh-huh
are you a native $unc$texan
i sure am
oh
ive lived here all my life
good for you
but any way
have you ever been to $unc$austin
yes
yes
we went last summer actually
this
how was
im wondering im really not familiar
i know there are some good places to go camping along the lakes
is there
okay
we didnt go camping
we drove down to $unc$houston to visit friends
and we went to $unc$galveston and to $unc$san $unc$antonio and then up to $unc$austin and kind of doing the sight seeing type stuff
uh-huh
so we didnt go camping
that would be fun though to go
thats $unc$one thing my husband wanted to do on this summers vacation was to go and camp wherever we went
and i said id love that
but
it takes a lot more planning
it does
and ever once on my week-long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered by a hotel and a waiter
uh-huh
right
exactly
exactly
yeah
so were hoping to do a $unc$three day weekend
theres a thing called $unc$pfeiffer $unc$rim
i dont know if you have ever heard of it
no
i havent
theres a town called $unc$glenrose
i think its around $unc$two hours from here
and it has dinosaur tracks and stuff like that
that sounds great
and its got $unc$one of those wildlife parks
yeah
i think thatll be fun
so were going to try to do that on a $unc$three day weekend go there
and
have you ever camped out of state
no
i havent
where you should try sometime is $unc$colorado
where at
it is beautiful
is it
absolutely beautiful
ive just been up there skiing
and weve driven through but not camping or anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i would love to camp in the mountains
yes
$unc$estes $unc$state $unc$park is fantastic
thats what my girlfriend says
yes
she loves that place
you need to go there
she loves that
she says that where we need to go sometime
its high canyon
and theres this little mountain lakes
and its very peaceful
oh
and in the early fall time
uh-huh
i cant remember what type of trees they are
but all the leaves turn yellow
oh
and its just brilliant
and
i love that
yes
you would
youd like it very much
thats neat
thats neat
i know you would
i used to go camping all the time as a $unc$girl $unc$scout
i was too
all the time i got real used to it then
yeah
i felt like we roughed it then
we did
we really did
i just dont understand these people that think taking an r v and parking it and sitting inside and watching t v and having your microwave
right
yes
exactly
its not camping
we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything
right
right
that is it
you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping
right
oh
yeah
you say you havent been in years
no
i havent
im a struggling single mom
gosh bless your heart
and
thank you
its
time is precious
moneys precious
yes
and it
i think i havent been able to do it
and that was $unc$one of the things i really thought id like to do with my children again
uh-huh
uh-huh
and im a little bit fearful of trying that just women
i dont blame you
i dont blame you at all
i hope
years ago it would have been fine
but
yes
i really now i have gone on $unc$one little vacation just the girls and i
we drove down to $unc$port $unc$aransas and rented a little efficiency and had a marvelous like $unc$two nights
oh
yeah
yeah
and that was great
and even at that it was like the first time that i ventured out of the city by myself
uh-huh
and i stayed in a nice place
but its real different not to have another adult with you
yes
i kn-
i can imagine
im just a chicken
i know lots of women would do it all the time
no
i dont blame you not nowadays
i havent quite adjusted
yeah
now are you with $unc$t $unc$i down there
i was with $unc$t $unc$i until $unc$january
i left $unc$t $unc$i in $unc$january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
good
so it was a good plan but i havent yet
have you
okay
i got into sales
and im selling telephone systems
oh
thats neat
and its fun
and its interesting
but its also pretty challenging
and i havent started making money yet
its hard isnt it
so yeah
its hard
how old are your girls
$unc$eleven and $unc$fourteen
goodness
yeah
so im old
no
youre not old
youre not old at all
excuse me just second
sure
honey ill be wi-
yeah
go ahead
theres someone at the door
okay
do you need to go
im going to listen
we always check and see if we should answer the door at night
yeah
thats very smart
yeah
so ive enjoyed this
yeah
me too
and
and good luck
how many have you made so far calls
i havent made any
ive been just a recipient
have you
theyre all
this is only about my second one ive ever made
ive been a recipient on the others
how many have you had so far do you know
i think ive had about $unc$four
$unc$four
thats good
ye-
yeah
very good
thats $unc$four each
when i had to sup-
this is my $unc$gemini nature
its like what are you interested in
yes
and its like virtually anything
ill talk about anything to anybody
yeah
i dont
yeah
you bet
you bet
and its been real interesting the different personalities that i run across
i know
yes
i always try to find out where theyre from
exactly
because it is neat
uh-huh
it really is
uh-huh
then i guess ill let you go so you can go get the door
and
thank you
and i enjoyed talking with you
me too
you have a good time camping
when you go next time think of me
thanks
okay
thank you
all right
bye-bye
bye-bye
go ahead
i usually dont get to hear any of the current events probably until about the $unc$ten oclock news
uh-huh
being
by the time you get off work go by and pick up the baby from the baby sitter its after $unc$six
and by the time everything is settled in
its $unc$ten oclock before i can catch up on anything
yeah
i guess thats the way i am too
sometimes i hear some things on the radio
uh-huh
yeah
i only get the newspaper on the weekends
so
uh-huh
i dont even have time to read the newspaper except in passing
uh-huh
ill look over my husbands shoulder and see whats going on
i guess occasionally ill hear someone at work say something though
but
yeah
we have a news thing on the computer that ill try to look at every day
uh-huh
and its pretty much headline news
yeah
which isnt pretty much what we look for anyway
uh-huh
but do you think that the quality of the news events that you get are
what do you think about it
i guess its pretty good
and like the $unc$dallas area
uh-huh
and i guess when youre in a big metropolitan area like this
theres i guess a lot of pressure in that business to borderline at that
yeah
theres a lot of competition in the media
uh-huh
and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out whos going to get the best headlines and that theyll run a topic into the ground
yeah
and they try to play publics opinion which i think is awful because it usually works
uh-huh
true
ill bet that was the case of the war in the $unc$middle $unc$east
yes
uh-huh
that
lots of new newsmen were created during that
so it will be interesting to see what happens
uh-huh
true
trying to think what else is current
right
i dont know what to say
thats a bad $unc$one
they
looks like were going to have an income tax in $unc$texas
yeah
i hate to see that
but if what its going to take
we can deduct that from our federal income tax
uh-huh
but we need good schools
were more involved in that now
and i think its better for everybody if we had better schools
yeah
thats true
i would think they could find a better way to fund it though
but they havent for
no
i wish they could have gotten a lottery
theyre struggling with it
yeah
i think the lottery could have helped with that
it wouldnt have been as painful as what we wouldve paid in state income tax
probably would have paid the same amount
but its not the idea of your paying income tax
uh-huh
true
im not sure theres a positive solution for that
no
itll be interesting to see what happens
trying to think what else is current
i havent seen the news in a couple of days
so it
im a little behind on things
the other thing i can think of is what is still going on in $unc$iraq and the $unc$kurd refugees
yes
thats sad
yeah
they had to choose between the better of the $unc$two bad situations
and i dont know what ive would have done in the situation
uh-huh
yeah
it begins to make you wonder why we didnt go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there
yeah
right
but i understand why $unc$bush doesnt want to go in and take sides
because that would definitely look like another $unc$korea
uh-huh
and hed have all these people jumping down his back even though id agree with it
i think he shouldve gone in there and blew them away
seems to have helped him though popularity wise
yeah it did a lot
he did a real good job i believe
i have in-laws that live in $unc$saudi $unc$arabia that stayed there during all of it too
it
so we kept very much abreast of what was going on
yeah
in any of the areas where some of the scuds
yeah
they were near $unc$dahran on the east coast
um-hum
yeah
they were just north of it probably about a $unc$hundred miles from the kuwaiti border
and they stayed active was the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert
uh-huh
it was a new situation
yeah
ill bet
i dont really have much more to say
i dont know anything else thats current other than the weather
and
youre right
and thats awful in $unc$texas
have you all been getting rain storms down there
we got some awful rain the other morning
and todays just been real drizzly
we did last night some real massive thunderstorms
yeah
apparently i dont know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too
uh-huh
caused some damage
it did
we may get some more tonight
weve just got slight chances of rain
but we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning
course while everybody was getting ready to go to work making nice traffic jams
so
uh-huh
the ground here is so flat
and its all saturated now
oh
were getting some flooding
right
when was it last week we had all the rain
but
i think we had about $unc$eight inches
it was between $unc$six and $unc$eight inches here where we are
goodness
and you walk out on the ground
its awful
its just so soggy
yeah
its a lot more humid down that way
yeah
in fact miserable
today the air was just so sticky so damp
yeah
i think there were places around downtown $unc$fort $unc$worth last night they got $unc$three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just a bunch
goodness
i guess thats it
right
its
thats about as much as we can do with current events
right
it was nice talking to you
good talking to you $unc$michelle
all right
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
the public school systems everybodys has known theyve needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
uh-huh
the first direction that i would love to see them go with
kids learn at different rates
and for too long theyve kind of lumped everybody together
youd learn at this rate
and thats the only way its going to happen
yeah
thats true
youve got some kids thatll pick up on it in the first $unc$three minutes youre talking about it
and the other $unc$fifty-seven minutes youve been talking about a subject youve bored them
yeah
yeah
thats very true
i guess i can relate to that because i have $unc$two kids that are opposites like that
$unc$one picks up real quick
and the other $unc$one doesnt
and youre right they do get bored really fast if they already know what youre talking about
what do you propose that they do
what is your suggestions
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person
uh-huh
out of each child
out of each child
each individual child
some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff
other kids are going to be really into math
some are really going to be heavy into reading
right
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction its great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff
yeah
thats
but why not hit the points the kids really interested in
because if hes interested hes going to study it
and hes going to learn it
and hes going to remember it
thats true
i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that every child needs to learn every subject
that might be the only thing
but i definitely agree with you
they need exposure to every subject
they dont need to be masters of it
right
right
thats true
everything i learned about ancient $unc$rome has not helped me anywhere in my adult life
yes
i definitely agree
theres no doubt about that
i can relate to that because im going to college right now
and i feel like im taking this history class
and its so boring
and i just hate it
and i think why do they make us take this stuff
what does this have to do with getting a computer science degree or whatever
what type of history class is it that youre having to take
american history
we have to take this is like early $unc$seventeen hundreds through i dont know i think like mid $unc$eighteen hundreds
and then we have to take another $unc$one thats mid $unc$eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
the early ones they could actually combine $unc$two levels of it the $unc$one from $unc$seventeen $unc$hundred til say the end of the $unc$civil $unc$war
yeah
combine that into $unc$one and then from $unc$eighteen $unc$sixty-five to present
and make that your second step because to a point the early parts of it youre giving the foundations of the nation
yeah
thats basically what theyre doing
but even then theyre skimming over
theyre almost trivial with it
yeah
yes
definitely
i agree
yeah
theres
if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter they make all these people out to be
they were great men
and theyre the father of the country and all this
he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else
if not more
the man was not a saint
yeah
thats true
yeah
this school system thing
i tell you i saw something on the news i dont know maybe $unc$two weeks ago
and they were talking about
i dont know where youre from
but im from the $unc$dallas area
and they were talking about the $unc$plano school system that they had $unc$one school that if the students did something wrong whether it was behavioral or they werent learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows
they had not a table but a desk in this closet
and they had to sit in there by themselves
parents were getting really angry about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet
how is that helping my child
and the thing
they said were giving them isolation time
and this helps them to think
but a lot of kids
if a child has claustrophobia thats just going to terrify him
and
if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded
thats true
thats true
but no
they were
i definitely agree with parents
i think that is a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child
putting them in they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms
they didnt call them closets
but they showed these rooms on the news
and they looked like a closet to me with a desk in it real small
but they said that $unc$one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms
i said how is this helping
either way i definitely had to disagree with that
i think thats not the way to discipline a child by putting him in a closet
as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system i want to see changed too
when i was brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked
right
then the extreme came in
and now we can no longer spank them
right
so we now isolate them
yep
okay
weve swung the pendulum both ways
lets find a middle ground
there has to be some sort of discipline
and there has to be some sort of punishment short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child
right
lets put him into a situation where you crossed the line you broke the rule youre going to have to pay for it
right
but its going to tax you physically
uh-huh
i dont
instead have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar- do something to beautify the school property
yeah
thats true
but you cut
the kids having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
but hes seeing something constructive come out of it
i have to
i think $unc$one of the things that can come out of is not just discipline okay
but okay
for instance $unc$one of the things they do at my kids school they have what they call caught being good slips
and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if theyre being really good just being excellent theyre not cutting up and so on
theyre just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to
they get $unc$one of these caught being good slips
and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to what they call their caught being good store
and then they get to spend these like money
to me thats positive reinforcement is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because theyre going to be good and try and earn those things to get the positive part of it
theyd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked
so theyre definitely going to work towards being good rather than trying to act up and be bad
i think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself
theres been too much negative reinforcement
how much like the caught being good slips
how about just the $unc$john $unc$q $unc$citizen out there on the street
yeah
thats true i think really though
thats $unc$one thing that my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked
but i really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home also
and it really helps
and they dont get spanked very often
but they do when they deserve it
but i dont think any kid should be exempt from being spanked
i think i wouldnt mind if a teacher spanked my child
but thats just my personal opinion
and thats not going to
i dont think that law will ever change
they are never going to let a teacher spank a child again
but i dont think
some kids dont get spanked at home
and some kids need to be spanked at home
dont you think
i most wholeheartedly agree
but i dont know
theres a point of over kill
but somewhere youve got to find an even line
right
right
theres so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can
but there are times when a child needs to be spanked
they do things that they need that
need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked
right
okay
i guess my task
i usually ride my bike
i have a stationary bike and a regular bike
and when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because its so much nicer
the stationary bike is so boring
boring
but i have head phones
plus i have it in the living room
so i either watch t v or we have a fish tank
so i watch the fish whatever i can do to keep myself occupied
i like to have the t v on because that usually keeps me more occupied
it kind of takes the time away
and i dont realize thats really the only time i ever watch t v is when im on the bike
and then usually after im done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk
and that just kind of gets me to where im not quite as tired i guess
but its definitely a task
you think so
i cant say that i really enjoy it
i wish that i did enjoy it more
but i do it because i have to not because i want to
i bought a stationary bike
but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts
yeah
yeah
and i havent figured how to get that soft
and i tried even tying a pillow to it
but $unc$two years ago its not quite $unc$two years its almost $unc$two years i joined the $unc$cosmopolitan $unc$lady here in $unc$plano
uh-huh
and i love it
really
i just love it
so is it just women that go there
yeah
its totally women
i think thats whats my biggest problem with going to a health club
because i dont feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise
so i have tried to just do stuff at home
and i just feel conscious about it
im not big or anything
but i still dont like other people watching me
i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i dont have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low
yeah
right
and my bathing suits just $unc$one piece
so theres no big deal all the way around
but i dont have to be conscious of what im doing or how im doing it
uh-huh
and its a total free relaxation
because hey you can do what you want
youre a female
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing
thats what
and theyve got such fantastic equipment in there
really
thats great
yeah
how
and i love the water aerobics
i love the water aerobics
do they have a pool
or what is
yeah
theyve got a nice $unc$one
they have $unc$two types of water aerobics
they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it
ive heard that thats really good for you to do
it pushes you because youre pushing against the water in itself
uh-huh
so it is like double strenuous
but youre not being double strenuous on your own body
because youre pushing it yourself
uh-huh
so youre doing it yourself
so you dont really feel like youre really working that hard do you
huh-uh
when youre in the water
huh-uh
the only thing that i ever felt was every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting $unc$two jobs once in a while
i end up having to quit for a while
but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because i really jump a lot
wow
thats funny
i never would have thought of that
a lot of people wear those little terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool
so they just wear them right into the pool
are they water shoes
is that
yeah
theyre just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber soles so that
okay
okay
okay
okay
no big deal $unc$one way or the other
thats really funny
but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway
so no big deal
thats
but its fun
so how often do find yourself going
if youre doing it on a regular basis how often do you go
i try to make it at least $unc$three times a week
yeah
thats really
for a while i was doing it every day just going $unc$five days a week
really
i wish that i could make myself exercise every day
but i do force myself to do it at least $unc$three times a week which i dont feel like is enough
but its at least something
it
i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really dont enjoy it
but i know that i have to do it
its not a question of whether i want to
but
when i was working up at the $unc$summit here in $unc$plano id leave there
uh-huh
and id be at the swimming pool about $unc$four $unc$thirty because they start at $unc$five to $unc$six
thats
so i was there by $unc$four $unc$thirty every night
and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
uh-huh
because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet
uh-huh
but the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your chest id say
yeah
so its your choice where you want to go
but i enjoyed it higher
did you ever
im sorry
thats okay
did you ever go to $unc$texins at all when you were working for $unc$t $unc$i
did you ever try that
i have a bad back
so im very limited what i do
okay
its like i can walk
but if i walk for more than $unc$fifteen minutes its going to bother me
especially when youre on cement or anything thats hard
it will bother me
then that would
yeah
it will bother me
i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldnt it
what pushed me that way though basically was the fact that when i went in there is wasnt for the water aerobics
i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles
oh
and she said go for the swimming pool
she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor
she says in fact you get more
wow
i said okay because im not a swimmer
uh-huh
i like water
im not scared of it
but i couldnt
i guess i could swim across the pool
but im no swimmer $unc$per $unc$se
yeah
but i found that this worked really well
and i came out of there
and i saw my stomach going down well
oh
i dropped id say almost $unc$twenty pounds just by watching what i ate
wow
and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
what if youre already on $unc$one
what
a diet
yeah
when you go in there they wouldnt make you do theirs would they
no
they have nothing to do with that
okay
when this $unc$one down here opened up i joined as a $unc$v $unc$i $unc$p
and the $unc$v i $unc$p gives you a computerized diet
and they go over all your health and all your history
and they show you everything to do and how to do it and the whole $unc$nine yards
so it became part of the package
so i went through it
it worked out well
but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program
is that what youre saying
yeah
you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too
i see
okay
i just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit
so its less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time
so its like when i got laid off
i went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since id done it
so i get all the same treatment again
so its kind of nice
wow
thats
like i said i like it
i like the heat
i like the
i jump out of the swimming pool
and i go into the hot tub
oh
and i love it
yeah
that would be really nice
because i have never
let me reword that
i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore
but thats because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
uh-huh
thats
i knew i was pushing too far
uh-huh
but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out im totally relaxed when i go home
its no big deal
so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your
its fun
its fun
ive gotten on the bike
and theyve got the stepping bike where you step
uh-huh
and ive enjoyed that watching how well i can walk up and down stairs
thats
i wanted to get $unc$one of those steppers when i bought the bike
but most of the others to me are very dull
but i got talked into the bike instead
and i dont know
i really wanted a stepper
im considering maybe even buying $unc$one of those too
but im not sure if ill get benefit out of both of them
i dont know if it would really do any good having both of them
which $unc$one do you feel is better since you use them both
i get bored very easily
the $unc$one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit
like you said you can sit and do it and watch the t v and not even really be conscious of what you are doing
uh-huh
with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because youre basically watching each step as it gets harder and down
so you have a little
you can program the $unc$one at $unc$cosmopolitan $unc$lady so to what your gear is
uh-huh
i
it would depend upon which $unc$one you want
i think now that ive had the bicycle
i would go to the stepper
but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or $unc$one of the others and use it for a while
because you can buy a months membership and see what you feel is best for you
really
because it all depends for everyone their own what they want to do
because i jump on the bike here at home
mine has the handle bars go up and down
uh-hum
so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said
and it has no effect on me
so its boring
uh-huh
okay
do you want to go first
you can go first
or i will
you go ahead
okay
im going to tell you what id have
down in the south we have a lot of shrimp okay
oh
yeah
and i have shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook
yeah
uh-huh
and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea
and wed have a lemon pie for dessert
it sounds fantastic
yes
and whats really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your rice cooker
yeah
uh-huh
and you place the shrimp in the rice steamer
and you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it
uh-huh
now you can either use the kind that comes in the little can
or you can just get some regular red peppers
is it cayenne pepper you mean
cayenne
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you put a little bit of that over it
now if you use the dried kind then you would only use $unc$two of them
yes
and you put that in there
and then you pour $unc$two bottles of beer over it
and how much shrimp would you use
$unc$two pounds
$unc$two pounds
okay
thats the jumbo shrimp in the shells
yeah
leave the shells on them so they wont just roll up
uh-huh
and you pour the beer over the top of it
and you cover it
uh-huh
and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil and the shrimp turn pink
okay
uh-huh
then you remove it
and you put it on a platter
and then you serve it with melted butter
and i usually put garlic powder in mine
yeah
and they can just dip it
and they shell it as they eat it
sure
but then the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave
uh-huh
and what you do is you just wash it
and you core it in a what do you call it $unc$pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
uh-huh
uh-huh
a glass dish
uh-huh
uh-huh
but its got to have $unc$one that has a cover on it
okay
uh-huh
and you put about $unc$two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
yeah
and then you just set your cauliflower in there
uh-huh
and then you cook it for $unc$seven minutes on high
and you rotate it $unc$one time
and are you cooking the whole head at $unc$one time
uh-huh
when you core it you be real careful so you wont knock your flowers off
okay
i see
and you just set it in there
and you microwave it on high for $unc$seven minutes
and you turn it $unc$one time
uh-huh
and while thats cooking i take about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder
and i mix it all together
and i shred up some just regular white cheese
uh-huh
and after thats cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that
and you cook it for another $unc$three minutes on high just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it
uh-huh
and its done
yeah
that sounds fantastic
it is good
but it looks
what i usually do is ill sit the cauliflower in the middle
and then i put the shrimp around the outside of it on my platter
uh-huh
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that
and you have all the different seasonings and stuff
and then i just fix little individual cups for them
and they have the garlic bread
sure
and it makes it a real nice looking
and its not much work
huh-uh
huh-uh
but it looks like it
that sounds
yeah
real-
you look like you went to a whole bunch
i bet it tastes good too
right
and usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it
yeah
and ill lay those on top of my salad to make it look nice and things like that
how many could you serve
okay
it usually serves $unc$six
yeah
okay
i figured about that
yeah
thats good
see out here we have so many ethnic people
we have $unc$italians
and we have $unc$portuguese
and we have $unc$russians and $unc$polish
and it depends out here the type of people youre going to entertain
uh-huh
so its hard
you just have to pick something for the group that youre going to entertain for that particular time
yeah
and theyre big on finger food here too chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff barbecue and cooking out in the yard when its nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
yeah
yeah
have you ever had crawfish
no
but i have had shrimp
you ought to try some crawfish
they are good
but thats $unc$one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over even if its like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
of course
they want it from down here
thats
yeah
because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
really
but
is it like shrimp
its similar
uh-huh
its similar
yeah
its not exactly
ch-
its got a taste of its own
but it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it
it does
does it look like a lobster
it looks more like a crab
it looks more like a crab
uh-huh
oh
but
are they thin long or wide
no
i cant even think of what you
i guess it looks more like a cross between a crab and a lobster
uh-huh
because its small like that
and its got the pinchers like a crab
but its similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would
uh-huh
yeah
yep
and we call them mud bugs
oh
but theyre fantastic tasting
they are so good
everybody
its the season for them right now
and where did you say you were from
$unc$louisiana
$unc$louisiana
do you do cajun cooking
yeah
i love blackened the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
uh-huh
we have a few places up here that do that
yeah
and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it
yes
it is so good
how do they do the blackened
you buy it as a seasoning
but do you have to have a certain skillet or something
huh-uh
huh-uh
no
i cook mine do you have a black iron skillet
i did have
i dont have it now
but i have mostly $unc$teflon
okay
i guess you could cook it in that too
you now
but
but i dont know
i never have
i use the black iron skillet to cook mine
does it have to get extremely hot
uh-huh
yeah
but it doesnt burn or anything like that
the blackening is really the seasoning
uh-huh
its a blackening seasoning
i see
yeah
that is a seasoning
its not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
i see
because what its called is $unc$blackening $unc$magic
and it comes in a bottle
and im trying to see
oh
its got a picture of $unc$dom $unc$de $unc$luise on it
really
uh-huh
oh
you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time
right
is that what youre saying
uh-huh
uh-huh
because i could have the chicken on the skewers with blackened seasoning
but
uh-huh
and that is so good delicious
yeah
but you do have to have it hot when you cook it your pan
uh-huh
uh-huh
it does have to be really hot when you put it in
but its not like its burned
and what blackens it is the seasoning
oh
and it is so good
oh!
it is
i love it
yeah
in fact i was in $unc$texas for a little while
uh-huh
and i liked the barbecues and the mexican food
uh-huh
i have a passion for all that type of different tastes
because i have been brought up mostly italian american food
because my parents are italian and portuguese
so we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and roasts and that kind of thing
uh-huh
thats why i enjoy going to restaurants and trying different things
have you ever thought about coming to $unc$louisiana to visit
i would love to
yeah
you ought to come down
i
you dont even have to go all the way to $unc$new $unc$orleans if you want to really get some good food
really
you dont have to go that far south
uh-huh
but of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as im concerned
is that right
and fact is were going to take a vacation this year
were going to go to $unc$new $unc$orleans again
uh-huh
and were only going down there for the food though
where do you go when you go there right on $unc$basin $unc$street and those places
yeah
we go to the $unc$french $unc$quarters and stuff like that
uh-huh
and i have some friends that live down there
and so usually we dont go to the tourist ones
oh
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to
i see
and we went to this $unc$one
it was called the $unc$back $unc$porch
and they were cooking the stuff while we went on this boat ride
and then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch
and usually if you can find somebody
thats nice
of course now when you go down there theyve got just
theres no where you can miss
uh-huh
i have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full
its unreal
really
its so good
the seasoning its just unreal
and dont they make a lot of
im trying to think what they call their soup
i dont know
gumbo
yeah
jumbo
no gumbo
gumbo
uh-huh
right
right
is that with seafood
uh-huh
you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood
you can
uh-huh
that looks good too
ive seen the chefs on t v do that
uh-huh
and it looks delicious
and ill tell you what
we do a thing we call it a sea bake
you take clams
okay
you
do you have any pets
we got $unc$two cats
$unc$two cats
yeah
and
yeah
my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies
uh-huh
so im used to having cats around
i like them
yeah
i like having pets around in general
i favor dogs over cats actually
but
im not a dog person at all
im a dog person
i had
i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right
yeah
probably
i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid in fact
uh-huh
i may still be
we
but not cats
that
i wonder sometimes
uh-huh
but we house sat for my wifes boss a couple weeks ago
and he has a dog and everything
we were sitting the dog and everything
and i felt like just miserable all weekend
and it really didnt dawn on me until $unc$sunday
it was like hey maybe youre still allergic to the dog
it was like that could be it
the thing i dont like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek of the dogs and constantly
yeah
dogs are real high maintenances
you got to take them for walks
and youve got to pay a lot
you need to pay attention to cats and everything
but its not quite the same thing
yeah
thats true
and its just nice that cats you dont have to let them outside
all cats are indoor cats
uh-huh
so youre not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood
and they make their mess in the cat pan which is
limited
yeah
its a pain to clean
but we used to
they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats pans
they didnt
really
when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time
and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and use this thing to take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
it was really terrible
but now you get these liners that is garbage bags
uh-huh
and you the
that sounds so easy what i did
yeah
the cats do it in there
you pull it and take it out and throw it away
and thats it
yeah
i housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis
uh-huh
and what we used to do was just put newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing
same idea
then i would do it everyday or $unc$two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely
everyday
and so it wasnt so bad
okay
i see
$unc$two cats and just as easy
it just never started smelling
i would put just a little bit of cat litter in there because if i put a lot $unc$one of the cats would have been
uh-huh
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted
uh-huh
i that true
yeah
yeah
shes got $unc$one dog now and the $unc$two cats
and her dog there is basically a reject
somebody had bought him and wanted him
uh-huh
it was her ex boyfriend and just was not mature enough to keep the dog didnt realize how much work it was
and now shes stuck with it
uh-huh
and shes just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
but i think that for me my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat
because thats all there is to it
so
so you dont have anything right now
no
we dont have anything right now
except the kid
thats
right
now we have a kid
but he was completely against having a dog or cat
he said theyre as much work as a kid
and theyre harder to get rid of for the weekend
and
i dont know because the cats pretty much
yeah
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
uh-huh
and its not a big deal really
theyre happier when were around
but theyre pretty much okay by themselves
and we couldnt do that with a dog
thats really true
but other friends of mine have cats
they have $unc$four of them
and if they go away they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that
and their cats theyre so used to the attention that if they dont get it they get really upset
thats pampering the petals
and they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that
i figured something having
so i tried to have a goldfish
uh-huh
and i killed that one within a very short amount of time
but theyre not that much fun
you cant take them for a walk
you cant
they cant fetch
right
they cant do anything
so ive never
i think we had fish when i was a kid
but i dont
my brother had fish when i was a kid
i remember that
and $unc$one of his fish jumped out of the what do you call it fish tank and fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser
ill never forget that
because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish
oh
and $unc$one of the fish was missing
and they couldnt find it anyplace
they couldnt figure out what had happened
and then they found it fried on the radiator behind
oh
it was not gross
i didnt see it
but got them
oh
trying to remember we had a dog for a while
and i dont know if we got rid of the dog
because my brother was allergic to it
my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think hes outgrown now
uh-huh
but because of that we didnt have very many pets afterwards
and then he had fish
uh-huh
and you
like you say theyre not the most exciting pet to have
no
its like
i dont know
i just never understood what the attraction
theyre pretty and everything
but ive just never seen the attraction of having fish
its not as much fun
a friend of mine had an eel
an eel
and then he had a
i forget what type of fish it was
it was $unc$one of these fish that it ate a big other fish and things like that
there would be sort of moby fish in a tank
now we really get sick
yeah
and it
i couldnt see having fish like that
yeah
i could see having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty
but
i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha and used to drop mice in
uh-huh
these arent cats
yeah
this is gross
yeah
no
that would be
what did they do everyone come around and watch them
yep
i guess thats fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and your things destroyed the mice
yeah
but
yeah
a cat will do the same trick
lets see
i had a pet rat for a while
and it was a live rat
and this woman just offered it to me while i was in graduate school
and she was actually a very fun pet
i had a friend in college who had a pet rat for a while
uh-huh
i forget how she got it
but it was the same kind of a deal
i think she got it
i think she was a psych major
and she got it from the psych department
yeah
mine had been a
how did this work
a mill rat had been bought
and the people in the lab $unc$one day called in my friend and said this rat is acting really strange i think hes sick
and she said i dont think hes sick i think shes pregnant
whoops
and they had misclassed the sex of back there
and so she asked me if i want $unc$one of those babies
and i took the baby
and i got her when she was just this tiniest little thing like half the price of a mouse
uh-huh
and then she grew to be
i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand
and then she grew to be pretty big a pound or something
uh-huh
i dont know how much
and i had her for over $unc$two years
and she was very affectionate
she would crawl on me
and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that much more than you would think
uh-huh
yeah
if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts
so
yeah
and
yeah
rats are not my favorite animals in the world
but i could see getting $unc$one from birth and everything
yeah
sort of weird for me to have had $unc$one too
but there
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage
and it was easy to take care of
yeah
but
yeah
i have friends with hamsters and gerbils
and they tell me the same thing
uh-huh
i just
again it gets into vivant much fun what i guess they can be
i
it was more fun than you would think starting from the beginning
but
yeah
we also live in the city now in $unc$manhattan
okay
and so its almost impossible to
its not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly not a dog
right
people do
people
but its not
i dont
plus the pooper scooper $unc$one $unc$new $unc$york
so
yeah
you see all these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them
its really kind of funny
yeah
i was living in northern $unc$jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it
uh-huh
we were wondering if they had any special law for the horses in $unc$central $unc$park
right
no
they dont
i should make you
of course not
they have the bags behind them
but i think theyre actually supposed to keep them clean
hit the bags
but gosh i cant even walk by $unc$central $unc$park when summertime
just the smell is so bad of the horses
havent been up there
last time i was there was fall so probably wasnt that bad
its not that long ago
it was $unc$twelve times of the year
not this past fall
but fall a few years
it was almost $unc$october of $unc$eighty-five
uh-huh
i think was the last time i was up there and at $unc$center $unc$park
yeah
i had a friend who went to $unc$colombia
and i used to go up and visit her
uh-huh
so
yeah
thats not too far from were we live
you said you had $unc$two cats
just what you call it are they breed cats or anything
or are they just
no
theyre just mutts
uh-huh
yeah
my wife got them from friend of hers at work and everything as kittens
uh-huh
and this was before we even met
shes had them for a couple years
and theyre really cute
theyre sisters
uh-huh
$unc$one of them is a lot bigger than the other $unc$one
and she pushes the other $unc$one away from the food
apparently i dont know all the details
but they were born around $unc$christmas because $unc$one of them is named $unc$tinsel
and the other $unc$one is named $unc$holly
uh-huh
the scr-
theyre both females
both females theyre both spayed or whatever it is neutered
uh-huh
uh-huh
and theyre both declawed at least on the front claws
uh-huh
okay
the topic was should the $unc$united $unc$states adopt the metric system and if so should
how should they do it
why didnt it work last time
and why didnt it work last time
im all for it
yeah
i am too
i wish it had started a long time ago is the problem because were so wound up in the system that weve got that trying to convert over
yeah
and i guess they tried whatd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion
yeah
they tried the
$unc$one of them is where you just take whatevers already standard
and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like $unc$six point $unc$two $unc$eight $unc$seven instead of $unc$six millimeter
yeah
yeah
direct conversion
i dont know
i think they just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts
and people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
doesnt just about everything now have both metric and english
they do
but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages
you buy a quart of milk
and sure it has the metric equivalent written on there
but it still a quart
yeah
yeah
but if they started putting it in liters of oil and liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric
as long as you can still buy a product in the english units thats how youre going to think of it
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range
somebody had
i believe it was $unc$exxon
it figures
we were living in $unc$lubbock at the time
they started marketing it in liters
and it was only $unc$twenty-nine and $unc$thirty cents a liter
so they could put this sign out front that said $unc$thirty-nine cents a liter
right
and nobody had any idea what a liter was
so
thats the problem
when we finally out that liters was about a quart theres about $unc$four liters in a gallon
so you can figure out what youre actually paying for it
right
its kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age
i dont know
when i was growing up we were talking metric system in school not at first
uh-huh
but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
yeah
oh
i would expect people with any kind of buying power under the age of $unc$thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway
a liters about a quart
i think maybe theres where the problem came in
weve tried to instead of learning
its kind of like learning a language
when you learn $unc$one from the other you always end up in this conversion thing all the time
yeah
so you
its almost like
course this country isnt a dictatorship
but its like somebody said as of such and such a date anybody caught talking in the english will be shot or something like that
but
thing is its a global market place these days
and were like $unc$one of $unc$two backwards countries in the world as far as
yeah
i read that what $unc$uganda and
something
i dont remember what the other $unc$one is
but
theres $unc$one or $unc$two others that just
its just time i think for us to go over
because all you end up doing is if youre in business or youre in any kind of international
uh-huh
i dont
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
were all around the world
you have to perform this conversion anyway
yeah i do too
and
and $unc$one of the things that weve run into a problem
course youre familiar with any drawing system you end up with things in parts of inches half fourth this sort of thing
right
mils and microns
right
right
and then you end up with a decimal where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing
right
and then some of them are done in purely metric
yeah
i remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns
and ours were in mils
uh-huh
and it got to
somewhere down the line they went standardized
they went microns
but you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs
yeah
i can imagine
the $unc$one that
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
no
i was with $unc$t $unc$i in $unc$el $unc$salvador for a while
and i had to get used to purely metric system down there because they didnt understand anything else
if you start talking about miles theyd look at you like what
yeah
so i had a little bit of experience with it
and also i noticed in $unc$canada you drop a quarter $unc$fifty cents whatever in a $unc$coke machine up there
and you get this funny looking $unc$coke
its in a can thats taller but not as big around
yeah
i guess thats some
about half a liter
its not a liter
its like a half a liter or something like that
its a strange looking can
but my daughter in laws from $unc$panama
and they have had $unc$americans down there for so long that theyre kind of into both systems
but she gets real confused on distances
and temperature is the big thing the $unc$centigrade for which she says $unc$celsius
yeah
i would have more problem with the temperature except that working in engineering we do everything in $unc$centigrade or $unc$celsius
i had kind of gotten used to $unc$centigrade temperature
if its between $unc$zero and $unc$ten its cold
and if its $unc$ten and $unc$twenty its not too bad
if its between $unc$twenty and $unc$thirty its pretty warm
its getting warm right
if its more than $unc$thirty its just hotter than all get out
but the big problem is not having the resolution between a $unc$hundred if youre talking about a $unc$hundred degrees or what $unc$thirty $unc$zero $unc$thirty $unc$four degrees whatever that is
you dont get all the little differences
yeah
its about
the differences between $unc$seventy and $unc$seventy-two or $unc$seventy-five degrees isnt much
but the difference $unc$thirty and $unc$thirty-five degrees is quite a bit
is about twice as much what it works out to
yeah
$unc$five
$unc$one point $unc$eight times as many points
yeah
something like that
yeah
so i think as long as people have a choice theyre going to stick with the american way
uh-huh
and until we have to learn to think that way we wont
yeah
though we call it the english system
but im not sure what they do in $unc$england now
theyre on metric arent they
yeah
for the most part i think so
yeah
except theyve got a
we run into some problems once
i remember theyve got a nut and bolts system called $unc$wentworth
and this thing was even different than $unc$s $unc$a $unc$e standards and stuff
so
right
this ca-
okay
my dad bought $unc$one of these little $unc$nash $unc$metropolitans here quite a few years back
and the thing had a $unc$austin $unc$heeley type engine
it was $unc$austin motors engine and running gear
right
and the body was built by $unc$nash
or who
that was even before $unc$american $unc$motors
but $unc$nash essentially in the $unc$u $unc$s somewhere
and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and $unc$wentworth and $unc$s $unc$a $unc$e
he ended up with about $unc$three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing
he just get $unc$one more
because i think the $unc$wentworth and the $unc$s $unc$a $unc$e bolt sizes were the same
but the threads were different
and it was a total mess
that would be a mess
and on my $unc$chevy van thats a couple of years old
part of its built in $unc$canada
matter of fact the thing is i always say its built off shore because it was assembled in $unc$canada
the only thing that was in it built in the $unc$u $unc$s was the differential
and it was built in $unc$buffalo $unc$new $unc$york
but its got the hardest combination of metric
and most of the body parts seem to be metric
and most of the engine parts seem to be $unc$s $unc$a $unc$e
so its just crazy
right
it just gets bad
you got to have $unc$one and not mix them up
yeah
because youre never going to get to $unc$one system if you still got a mix
and of course here that would involve changing road signs all across the country miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole $unc$nine yards
kind of hard to do gradually
i thought maybe they would convert to metric back when they went to the $unc$fifty-five mile an hour speed limit because what is it $unc$fifty-six or fifty-sevens a $unc$hundred kilometers
yeah
and
youd have people doing a $unc$hundred miles an hour
yeah
youd have
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than $unc$fifty $unc$five
youd have people going youre right a $unc$hundred miles an hour
yeah
and so i dont know
id kind of
and the other thing too is between here and $unc$el pasos what $unc$five $unc$hundred miles
but its almost $unc$eight $unc$hundred kilometers
thatd sure seems like a long way
yeah
but theyd seem to be ticking off faster too
yeah
i guess thats it
every road sign you come to is like i dont know it that far
they converted all the road signs to $unc$fifty-five miles an hour
they couldve converted it to metric just about as easy
yeah
i think they
you got the problem with all your cars are still
yeah
you still got cars on the road that dont have both
yeah
at that time that was still when things were
the metric system was still not
not all that common
now cars they have both
sooner or later theyll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was in $unc$panama wheres a lot of the road signs and everything are in miles per hour
and some are in kilometers
and you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour
yeah
$unc$jack what type of music do you like
i like classical and sort of popular rock type music
uh-huh
yeah
i enjoy classical too
i never really had listened to it till i got married
oh
and my wife enjoys it
uh-huh
so i had never listened to it till then
but now i listen to it whenever she does
and even every once in a while i put it on myself
yep
yeah
yeah
i used to play the piano
and i like $unc$bach and sort of the baroque music $unc$handel and $unc$vivaldi and those kinds of
uh-huh
yeah
those are really nice
i like those
yep
yep
though i couldnt tell you anything about them other than when my wife says this is $unc$bach
oh
yep
yep
i dont know all that much myself
i just know when i hear it that i like it
uh-huh
yeah
that you w-
what you like
how about popular music
yeah
whatsevers on the radio is usually okay with me
but sometimes i have a hard time hearing the words clearly if im in the car and theres noise and stuff
yeah
so
its mostly just the tunes
yeah
im pretty much the same way
people always say wow! the meanings of those words
yeah
i know
and im always meaning
theres wor-
i just thought they just all sort of rhymed
i know
i know
about the only thing i can remember after the song is over is the refrain
right
yeah
that whenever they say it $unc$two or $unc$three times
yeah
yeah
im the same way
yeah
its funny depending on where you live
i commute back and forth between $unc$baltimore and a rural town called $unc$salisbury which is $unc$two and a half hours away
uh-huh
and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different
uh-huh
when
really
yeah
because $unc$baltimore will play more what might be considered a little bit more progressive
uh-huh
and as soon as you go down to $unc$salisbury this town thats $unc$two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever in a real rural $unc$maryland it turns into basically classic rock
yes
yeah
and they dont
oldies or what
yeah
mostly oldies
yeah
but classic rock
when the $unc$doors movie came out $unc$doors was really on the radio there where youd hear $unc$one or $unc$two of their more famous songs maybe top $unc$forty in $unc$baltimore
uh-huh
but in $unc$salisbury thats all you would hear was this is the $unc$doors!
yeah
yeah
so it was sort of a funny thing
yeah
yeah
theres a big variation among the country
if you go down south country music and
y-
yes
thats
im starting to realize that
i never really thought about that much
but there is
yeah
yeah
yeah
i didnt
i lived in $unc$pittsburgh before $unc$baltimore
and i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area
uh-huh
i really didnt notice at all
it just seemed the same
yeah
but when i went more rural it really changed
yeah
yeah
$unc$chicago has a lot of good stations
does it
yeah
yes
in fact they have a continuous news station which is nice if youre driving and you want to h-
yeah
you dont have to wait till the hour mark
its sort of constant
you just turn there
uh-huh
and you get the latest news and everything
its sort of like $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
you turn on your t v
and its on
right
yeah
boy that would really be beneficial
so yeah
because you never hear the news basically on the radio
i never get it
yeah
yeah
and if you dont read the paper you sort of fall behind if youre in the car all the time
yep
yep
yep
yeah
thats pretty good
so
yeah
i like to listen to tapes of music or stuff on a long trip
uh-huh
uh-huh
and now you can even get books on tape
yeah
yeah
on fact my grandmother does that a lot because shes blind
uh-huh
or shes losing her sight or whatever
yeah
but
yeah
that in
i can imagine if youre driving cross country listening to a story
uh-huh
s-
lot of the classics are really on tape
right
yep
yep
yeah
so thats a lot of fun
but
yeah
that would be good
yep
we strayed a lot from music
yeah
i guess so
but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening as long youre listening
right
so
right
yep
but if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off
yep
okay
$unc$jack it was nice to talk to you
yep
nice talking to you $unc$tom
and good luck
and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls
all right
good
bye
thank you
bye bye
$unc$carol since todays subject is our homes
why dont you tell me about yours
okay
i live in $unc$plano in a $unc$four bedroom $unc$two bath house which is the areas dominantly $unc$three bedroom $unc$two bath
so im just a little bit different than typical
and of course the $unc$plano area is basically with alleyways
so everything around here is set up that way which i think is a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way theyre constructed
and its a brick house with some wood
its real nice
i like it
how about you
i certainly hope so
we have a classic ranch up in $unc$denton
ranch style home i would hate to think that anybody thought the lot we live on as a ranch
its in a subdivision and $unc$one story
it started out life as a $unc$three bedroom house and now has no $unc$two car garage and has the $unc$two extra rooms enclosed
i suppose we still only have $unc$three effective bedrooms
but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage
are most of the houses in your area $unc$three bedroom $unc$two bath
almost a $unc$hundred percent
i cant think of any $unc$four bedroom houses in the subdivision
ours is probably the closest to it
you know how realtors are
theyll say this could be $unc$five bedrooms
yeah
if you had $unc$two people that dont have any clothes it could be a $unc$five bedroom house
yeah
to
dont need a closet
the only thing about mine i think theres probably about when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are identical to mine
and usually they are the $unc$four bedroom
but theyre spaced out id say maybe $unc$three on a $unc$two block period
because its all different builders up here
so its kind of hard at that point to classify some of the builders
but most of the builders all built $unc$three $unc$two
but the $unc$one thing my house is a little bit different
and i can pick it out again because its not typical
ive got the what do you call a double ceiling double high in $unc$one half of the house
so like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings
cathedral ceilings
and the kitchen is norm
and the bedrooms are norm
so it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way
and i love the space
its
luckily i came from a house in $unc$colorado which had the cathedral ceiling
and i just lucked out and walked into this $unc$one
and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well
so its a nice thing to move into
but again its not typical in this area
you can just spot them because the roof is so much higher
but
i hadnt thought about it in that sense of the high roofs
we have cathedral ceilings in $unc$two rooms in the family room and in the master bedroom
and those are pleasant
yeah
its like when my son goes up into the furnace area over the garage
yeah
he can walk
and hes $unc$six foot
and he says come on up $unc$mom im not going up there
im not going up there
but he says theres plenty of room up there for a room
so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem
but im not that ambitious
i tol-
maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and get angry ill start poking holes up there but until that time
but ive noticed the houses around here its $unc$one story and theyre all basically $unc$two bath with $unc$three bedrooms
and were
i guess probably a $unc$hundred percent of them all are mostly brick with some wood
right
but its basically all brick
the next subdivision over from me is total brick
and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine
but the $unc$one on opposite the street now theyre total brick
and theyre basically almost all $unc$three $unc$two
theyre all $unc$three $unc$two
but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice
if its the kind of river im thinking of better than us
are you talking about a real river creek
no
its a creek
theyve put little fountains in and such
thats nice
i came from $unc$mississippi recently
and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains
and they didnt pay any attention to banks and that kind of stuff
oh
so youre just as likely to wake up and discover youre in $unc$two inches of water
do you have a lot of yard around your house now in $unc$denton
its a third of an acre
i dont think thats a lot
in fact i have been real disappointed in the $unc$six years that ive lived out here about lot sizes
im more accustomed to a $unc$one acre lot being a standard and the $unc$two acre being what most people have
yeah
when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like theres no lot line at all
theyre built practically on top of each other
thats true
i know i was
and while there are some advantages to that theres less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things
i just feel hemmed in by that
its not as comfortable a living for me
uh-huh
this subdivision here has got
theres enough to put id say $unc$twelve feet between each house on each side
ive got more on $unc$one side than ive got on the other
but im like you
i came down from $unc$colorado
and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate
the fence is right there
just dont run too fast
or youll hit it
and im not used to that either
i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me
but to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard
and youve lost your back yard
entirely
sure
youve got a little place on $unc$one side or the other
but to me theyre not that big enough for a pool
but theyre going up
but its great for mowing
from that aspect youre right
and it doesnt take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff
but yes
im used to walking out the back yard
and you can play catch across the back yard
and youve got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but dont do it around here
no
the $unc$one
thats sort of what drove me to $unc$denton when i first came out here in $unc$eighty-five
i started looking
and it seemed like the further i got away from $unc$dallas center the more lot came with the house and the lower the price at the same time
and it just seemed like there was a $unc$ten $unc$thousand dollar drop for each city
i hadnt thought about it that way
so moving up $unc$thirty-five i stopped when i got to $unc$denton
it ju-
with our jobs mainly hitting downtown $unc$dallas we couldnt go too much further
but we went that way
it was the schools and the cost of houses
so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work
and thats where we stopped
it was the same problem
but i think planos
you all both work downtown
i got layed off by $unc$t $unc$i
this is a wonderful thing that youre doing here still helping them out
i ye-
but you were working downtown
no
i was working at the $unc$dallas site
my ex-husband was working downtown
oh
but $unc$t $unc$i as far as i concerned theyve been great as far as layoffs is concerned
so i have no problems
but as far as the housing personally i would like to move out of a $unc$four bedroom house and go with something smaller
but prices in $unc$plano there isnt a section in $unc$plano you can really move to without getting caught
and my price right now for what i pay
i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
uh-huh
so ill tell you is it a serious problem
yes
i do believe its a serious problem
yeah
uh-huh
however there are solutions to it
uh-huh
and foremost where we compare that we are now doing $unc$fifty percent of our people are voting
were probably making a comparison against some european and newer republics that have very high percentages
uh-huh
uh-huh
so $unc$one of the reasons that it is lower in the $unc$united $unc$states is that mostly we hold it on $unc$tuesdays
$unc$god knows why we hold it on $unc$tuesdays
and then we further complicate it by saying we will keep the polls open until $unc$eight oclock
what
right
a great number of people now work at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they wont be able to get to the polls in any case if they have to work late into the evening and not get up
my solution to that is that we hold it on $unc$sundays as do probably $unc$sixty to $unc$seventy percent of the european countries now
right
really
they hold it on the weekends
they hold it on either a $unc$saturday or a $unc$sunday or at least a day when a great number of people are not working
$unc$sunday
uh-huh
i-
in $unc$america that is not true because a great number of people work on $unc$sundays
but that is $unc$one of my solutions
i know here in $unc$dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections
and i do not think they have seen a really high improvement
have you absentee voted in $unc$texas
no
no
i always vote
i have absentee voted in $unc$new $unc$hampshire
and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot
really
i do not say that it is that complicated
but part of the process also is that you must preregister at some particular point
$unc$new $unc$hampshire is fairly easy
but other states you have to register every couple of years to just vote
to absentee vote specifically
oh
so registrations are perhaps a problem also
and were the mobile society
uh-huh
people are always mo-
$unc$one out of every $unc$seven people moves every year
that is almost a $unc$fourteen percent turnover every
uh-huh
if you compound that if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote
but i do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard
and the people that i have talked to
maybe that is another factor the motivational factor
the motivational factor is probably
right
i think that is the biggest $unc$one
i
thats the biggest problem
i
thats diminished by
w-we have noticed this in particular
i just read $unc$two books
$unc$one of them is whose stars and stripes now
uh-huh
the trivial pursuit of the presidency in $unc$nineteen eighty-eight
really
its a fairly decent book
its preceded by several other books by these guys
wake me up when its over was about the $unc$eighty-four elections
and i forget what the other books were
but any case i-i-it is the mar-
there was
blue smoke and mirrors was the $unc$one in $unc$eighty-two
these guys have taken the place of $unc$theodore $unc$white on reporting elections
in any case they say that theres a definite trend toward candidates using negative voting
it is the only way that you can use television effectively
i dont understand that
is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the publics gullibility
no
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor
and
if you go on the attack and put some sensational thing before the public as $unc$mike $unc$dukakis learned in the last campaign
and it is not refuted
people will believe it
if you dont refute it as he didnt there must be some truth to the matter
he did refute it
he refuted it
it just was not effective enough to
he didnt refute it til the last $unc$two weeks of the campaign
he didnt believe anybody would believe that
and indeed his trend started upward
i didnt believe anybody would believe that either
i guess i have a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the american public really was so
they do
dont give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability
and it
then how can a democracy work then
it
i dont know
how can it work
is it working
thats the question
i guess the question also that we discovered is that they dont throw rascals out
everybody seems disappointed
right
but they dont throw the rascal out their own rascal
right
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote
that sounds rather crass i think because then you are saying know it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually by paying them
what
you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
but it would be very difficult to administer because i am sure that any time money and votes are involved
the whole thing just stinks
how about the reverse of that
when i have heard about englands elections they are allowed to run for what a total of $unc$six or $unc$eight weeks even for the higher offices in the land
what if we just severely limited the campaigns so money wasnt so much of an issue
i feel like if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count
yeah
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
i dont care how easy it is for them
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote
they think whoever has the b-
they really think that the packs no matter what youre promised during a campaign
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance
you mean the special interest groups
right
and no matter what a candidate promises during the campaign which isnt very much specif-
they do not promise anything specific these days
but whatever you are promised they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office
i think thats the
read my lips and no new taxes
and yet $unc$bush did that
but hes excused from that
yeah
yeah
generally people ive read polls now where theyve excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget
then why did he say that during his campaign
he gave it
he promised the best he could
then he
it was totally irr-
and he is the $unc$president
and he should address those problems
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time
what was so funny about it is i guess that it happened so rapidly
he knew it
he actually knew it
and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that
yeah
yeah
yeah
and maybe he will
yeah
yeah
but i think it is
i think you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that
i think voters are motivated
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about
like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts and the newer democracies
because its going to be totally different
but
i dont know if they have higher turnouts overall
you do not think so
i dont think $unc$england has
i think $unc$england has about a $unc$seventy percent $unc$sixty-five percent turn out
uh-huh
i think that we just discovered in the indian elections is $unc$one of the greatest and massive things in the world
oh
just it got more violent every year
right
they went down almost $unc$fifty percent in this election before they blew up $unc$ghandi but simply because people were so concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way and the corruption of politics in that s-s-situation there
really
yeah
but everything is relative to when we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right
yeah
is
but before this $unc$voting $unc$rights $unc$act what we had was a great deal of our population mainly the $unc$blacks in the south and the $unc$hispanics were precluded by voting laws from their eligibility to register
uh-huh
oh
now everybody is available
oh
so if you really computed it they probably
when we said we had a $unc$seventy percent turnout in $unc$nineteen $unc$fifty we really only had a $unc$fifty percent turnout
because all the eligible voters
i see
because right
werent qual-
it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of
were disqualified
but isnt that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the $unc$blacks and $unc$hispanics and other minorities just dont vote
or is that just the truth
no
i think theres a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters
i dont know about $unc$hispanics
i havent studied the statistics well enough to
yeah
i think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction
right
right
but that just made me think of something that happened down here in $unc$dallas last year
they have this huge fight going over redistricting here
uh-huh
and at $unc$one point they took another vote on it
and the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to pass their plan
and this is something that had been going on for months
it was on the news every night
and they have had lawsuits over it
it was a major issue
and there still wasnt enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing
so thats i think that you have really hit on something there
to say that those
what do you mean
with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout
maybe it is now that we have minorities included in the
$unc$karen i wonder if we are recording
why
did you not press $unc$one
i did press $unc$one
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up
hi
my last auto repair was my alternator went out
i have a $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-six $unc$toyota
its a little $unc$tercel
uh-huh
and i have a friend whos real good with repairing cars
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and get a replacement part
uh-huh
so we went to a place called $unc$quality $unc$auto $unc$parts
and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything
and theyre very reasonable
so i bought the alternator
we put it on the car
and it didnt work
and it blew out all the fuses
no
yeah
how much was the alternator
i bel- something like $unc$sixty-nine dollars something on that order
did he hook up the wiring wrong
no
he hooked it up right
it was just that the part just didnt fit the car
so i took it back
and the guy in the parts shop took the alternator
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
and he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator
so we went back and tried it again put it on again
and it still didnt work
and we took the car up to a little place called $unc$pep $unc$boys
i dont know if you have them in your area
uh-huh
but theyre pretty reasonable car repair place also
so towed it up there because it wouldnt start or anything
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and took them about an hour to figure out what was blowing the fuse
and it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse
ended up taking it to the $unc$toyota dealer
and the only problem was that it had to be a genuine $unc$toyota alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it they sit in there and everything
but theres just some little difference that causes it not to work an i-
uh-huh
they probably built that in so they could make money
yeah
i guess so
and that was my last experience
i had a weird
theres a little sensing device im not sure right in front of the fan
its an air conditioner sensing device
i dont know why
it actually
theres a metal piece that fits through the belts
and somehow that broke off
and i still cant figure out how it broke
and anyway so this piece obviously
i have a $unc$subaru
and i think you can only get it through $unc$subaru dealer $unc$etcetera
so
uh-huh
this little sensing device costed like $unc$sixty bucks
goodness
are you able
and i havent had too many problems with my car
i got a $unc$eighty-eight $unc$subaru $unc$g $unc$l $unc$x $unc$t
and it
uh-huh
and then just basic maintenance and oil changes
and i do not do my oil changes
and i will not do my oil changes
i think the first time i tried to do $unc$one and ended up trying to ge-
yo- borrowed somebody elses jack
and i did this
and i went and bought everything
uh-huh
so after buying the filter and all the oil youre looking at $unc$ten bucks at least or somewhere in there and then to go to the trouble that i figured its easier spending $unc$eighteen bucks at $unc$jiffy $unc$lube
uh-huh
yeah
so thats
as far as any maintenance on my car i shy away from the oil changes
thats for sure
uh-huh
my car its an $unc$eighty-six
and i really hadnt had any trouble with it until that
and the car now has a $unc$hundred and $unc$thirty something $unc$thousand miles on it
and this was just recent
so i really cant complain about this $unc$one
how did you put that many miles on it in $unc$four or $unc$five years
i used to work
it was a $unc$seventy mile trip everyday $unc$two ways was $unc$seventy miles
a $unc$hundred and $unc$forty mile trip
no
it was just $unc$seventy miles
$unc$thirty-five miles each way
yeah
yeah
and i did that for about $unc$three years
and it really added up
ive only taken maybe $unc$two trips that were about $unc$four hours long down to $unc$shreveport
and the rest of it its just basically driving a long ways to work
and now i drive $unc$twenty-three miles each way
so im getting little relief
but still i drive a long ways
yeah
but i guess because theyre highway miles its not so bad on your car as if it were just regular street
uh-huh
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
yes
i do
okay
do you
i was going to ask you as far as how were getting compensated for what were doing right now
i dont work for $unc$t $unc$i
and i get these green
i dont know what you want to call them fake point things
points
uh-huh
and i just wondering how i go about getting the cash
theres a number that you call
its the same number that you call to make a call
okay
you call that number
and somehow or another theyll give you an option to leave a message
and you can leave a message
okay
i know someone that did that
you leave a message
and theyll call you back
okay
all right
thats good to know
i havent been doing
this is the first time ive been called in a long time
and i havent been doing it
so
really
and ive done it maybe $unc$twelve times
uh-huh
i dont know if ive done it quite that much
but mine is mixed up too
i have to call and get it fixed
lets see before i had this car i bought an $unc$audi $unc$five $unc$thousand
uh-huh
but i bought it used
i just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade-in
and it had a whole lot of miles on it
i figured maybe id get $unc$one or $unc$two years out of it
an i did get a couple of good years out of it
and the engine messed up on me
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the $unc$audi dealer
and he took the engine apart
and he just said he couldnt fix it
so the engine never got put back together again
i
i was driving a $unc$sixty-six $unc$plymouth $unc$fury
wow
i think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you
yeah
yeah
and thats when they made cars though
i dont know i-
the body was in good condition
and it ran fine
it was starting to burn some oil
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i had to ge-
about couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car
so
i read a book $unc$one time that said that the best cars were made before $unc$seventy-four
yeah
these cars made in the sixties and stuff
the thickness
theyre just you just dont see cars like that
uh-huh
and they last a long time
and they were simple too
the engines were simple and durable
and some people will still buy them
yeah
theyll
yeah
i guess its still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions
and i guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time
course i guess i could do the same thing with the $unc$toyota that i have
i just dont know how much theyll want to charge me to
it almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it
youre just better off buying another car
yeah
i guess so
but i just think they cost too much in the first place now a days
where was your last vacation
my last vacation was in $unc$connecticut
we went home to visit family
before that we were in $unc$hawaii
actually i did visit $unc$hawaii once
but i never made it off of $unc$oahu which ive heard is not the nicest of the islands
oh
it wasnt actually
it
when we were in $unc$oahu i couldnt wait to get off
we took a cruise
and we went to $unc$four different islands
and it was really nice
$unc$kauai was nice and $unc$maui was nice
we had a great time
uh-huh
we were there for $unc$ten days
thats
wow
yeah
yeah
yes
so where have you been
ive been lots of places
my last vacation was actually in $unc$morocco i guess
that $unc$one would count
$unc$morocco
really
that was about a year and a half ago
and
no kidding
an- what did you just decide to go there
or
my husband is french
and we were living in $unc$france at the time
uh-huh
and we decided that ive never been to $unc$africa
and i needed to get that continent since i hadnt been there yet
and its a fairly common vacation place for french people to go
and they speak french
so in that sense is just a little bit easier
uh-huh
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go
so we didnt really have enough time
yeah
im sure it was wonderful
we had about a little bit less than $unc$two weeks
uh-huh
and as always it seems a bit rushed
we do a lot of traveling around
we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
was it hot
no
in fact some of the days we froze
it was
really
we were there in the winter in $unc$january or $unc$february i dont remember which
uh-huh
uh-huh
i was born in $unc$saudi $unc$arabia
and when my father worked there they used to travel quite a bit all around in $unc$europe and whatnot
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i was very young
so i dont remember that
and i was $unc$three when we moved back here
at what age did you
thats too bad
because
so i dont remember
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
uh-huh
and that was when i was a baby
so $unc$morocco i think would be wonderful
because that area of the world i think would be great
yeah
it was a very interesting vacation
the only thing i didnt like was in some of the more touristy areas it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
uh-huh
and there were some places where people defini-
yeah
there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
uh-huh
and we had nothing taken because we knew
and we had things in inside pockets and in jacket underneath a coat type of thing
really
but
we found that in $unc$jamaica
it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell drugs and things like that
uh-huh
but they were so destitute
and i guess they make all their money on tourism
and they would come up and ask you if you want to buy different things
and really after awhile it really gets annoying
yeah
its a little scary too when theyre coming up and theyre all over you
the worst place was in $unc$marrakech
uh-huh
and the other cities it wasnt nearly as bad
and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
uh-huh
it doesnt matter who it is
and they keep everyone else away from you
really
and its worth it
and its like $unc$ten dollars a day or something
and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
really
and you feel stupid doing that
but we did it
uh-huh
and we were much happier
uh-huh
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone
uh-huh
thats great
where else have you been
you lived in $unc$france
yes
so youve been all through $unc$europe
no
i havent been all through $unc$europe like i havent been to $unc$italy yet
no
really
were going to go for a conference in $unc$september
and so hopefully well get to travel a little bit too
uh-huh
my more exciting spots have been
ive been to the $unc$galapagos $unc$islands
really
uh-huh
that was $unc$one of the most wonderful vacations ive ever had
lots of wildlife
yeah
yes
if you like wildlife its a fabulous vacation
uh-huh
if you dont like wildlife its probably not of interest
but that was really really fabulous
and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close
now when was that when were you there
$unc$august $unc$eighty-eight
uh-huh
and then after there i went to $unc$hawaii
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
uh-huh
and so i went to $unc$hawaii and then to $unc$australia and $unc$japan and $unc$china
uh-huh
did you go on the $unc$barrier $unc$re-
did you see the $unc$great $unc$barrier $unc$reef and go snorkeling
i didnt go diving
uh-huh
im a diver
and so thats actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
diving
uh-huh
but
no
i didnt get to the $unc$great $unc$barrier $unc$reef
i drove from $unc$sidney down to $unc$melbourne and over to $unc$adelaide
uh-huh
its gorgeous absolutely gorgeous
the coastline was just incredible
its huge
is it really
$unc$australia
yeah
yeah
yeah
but
did you have shrimp
ive seen in
they show all this wonderful seafood and great big prawns the big shrimp
and
i dont remember if i had shrimp
no
didnt have shrimp there
i dont think so
i remember food
i like that too
but in fact i didnt eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car
it would have been i think much more fun to do it in the van with a bunch of people
uh-huh
uh-huh
but
youre adventurous
you went by yourself
uh-huh
really
and i was by myself in $unc$china too
really
yeah
wow
$unc$china was a little bit more of a challenge
but it wasnt more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time
uh-huh
and so i never got out by myself or not much
uh-huh
was it very expensive
no
i paid about either a $unc$thousand dollars or a little bit
no
maybe it was about a $unc$thousand dollars maybe a little bit less
i dont really remember for $unc$ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare
but this is from $unc$hong $unc$kong
youre kidding!
no kidding!
uh-huh
because i was already in $unc$hong $unc$kong
but it only cost you about a $unc$thousand dollars to go there
and i went to $unc$beijing $unc$shanghai $unc$chengdu
and then i took a train up from $unc$shanghai to $unc$quingdao i think is the name of it
its a little sort of getaway retreat village not far from $unc$shanghai
its just a train ride
uh-huh
and that
i had $unc$two internal plane flights and a couple of other things
it was really
all for a $unc$thousand dollars
uh-huh
wow!
that really surprises me
around a $unc$thousand
i guess i relate it to $unc$japan where things are very expensive arent they
japans ridiculous
yeah
yeah
and i didnt stay in the top of the line hotels
but i stayed in
they were all completely clean
uh-huh
and they were newly built
and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you cant stay in the cheap stuff
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and you dont want to stay in the very exclusive because you dont really even get a flavor of the country if youre
right
right
yeah
yeah
wow
but
yeah
that was
i highly recommend that way to go
if youre ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman
her name was $unc$rita at $unc$china $unc$tours in $unc$boston
really
yeah
and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to $unc$china
and she just gave me this womans name to contact
and it would really be fun i think ideally with like $unc$two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
uh-huh
and then
i grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place
and im not for gun control in the strictest sense of the word
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think im kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself
yeah
i have quite a collection myself
and im a good hunter
and i started hunting when i was $unc$twelve years old
of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes
and i dont want to see them ban guns completely
yeah
but i dont want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
so
yeah
i feel that its
i think what was $unc$national $unc$rifle $unc$association had this bumper sticker a few years back about if you outlaw guns
only outlaws will have guns then
i believe that
and i believe that too because the person that is wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
yeah
yeah
and its the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns
we can handle it
but theres an element that cant
yeah
and its got to the point now where even our police departments and our $unc$d $unc$e $unc$a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons
because everybody thats in drug trafficking has got them
they have got them outgunned
yeah
so
there was an article in the paper just this week where i think its $unc$one of the gun companies i cant remember which was developing a $unc$ten millimeter automatic pistol for the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i which would give them additional firepower
it held a $unc$fifteen shot clip they would be able to put down anything that came at them
yeah
yeah
that would be
but you figure you got some drug guy out there thats got an $unc$uzi machine gun a $unc$thirty-eight
yeah
thats
$unc$smith and $unc$wesson revolver isnt going to do you much good
no
its sure not
huh-uh
yeah
i have lived in $unc$illinois at $unc$one time
and they passed a it wasnt really gun control
but it was you had to register as a gun owner
you didnt have to list your guns
yeah
but you had to have this card
it was like a drivers license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
and that was the first
this was $unc$twenty years ago
yeah
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect
in $unc$california they make you register when you buy ammunition
pardon
yeah
uh-huh
you have to sign a
they take your name and drivers license number hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition especially for handguns
yeah
yeah
yeah
rifles arent too bad
but any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it or sign up for it
yeah
so
we lived in $unc$tennessee for awhile
and i bought a pistol there
and there was a $unc$fifteen day waiting period
you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriffs office and get fingerprinted
uh-huh
and then you had $unc$fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
gee
thats not a bad idea
no
i think that a waiting period can make a difference
yeah
but again its going to be the law abiding citizen thats going to comply with that
yeah
yeah
it is
so i dont think theres any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because
no
the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
right
right
i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i feel kind of weird about that anyway
i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot
yeah
im
were getting into capital punishment now
yeah
but
but i agree with you there that
it would definitely be gun control
yeah
again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be
yeah
yeah
its not to keep people from buying a gun that need $unc$one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy thats illegal from getting his hands on $unc$one
yeah
yeah
and im in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting $unc$one in his hands
but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element
myself
yeah
and theyre actually a necessity in life
yes
theyre not
not everybody needs a gun
but sooner or later i need $unc$one
whether im out hunting or
im never had to protect my life or
yeah
i did in the service but not on the street
so i dont really need $unc$one in the aspects
you dont have to carry $unc$one in your car or your pocket all the time
no
huh-uh
yeah
no
so i use mine for recreation
yeah
i dont
and i enjoyed my guns
yeah
i have a good time with them
so
i know what
i took my kids out and taught them out how to shoot a gun
my wife the same thing she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that i have an arsenal or anything
yeah
but we have several guns around the house
$unc$one of these days my grandkids probably
probably
yeah
but i think its
you got to have the living in $unc$dallas theres not that many places to go shoot
but still i think they ought to know how to use $unc$one and that its not just a toy and that its not like on t v when someone gets shot they get back up
no
huh-uh
if someone gets shot with a real gun they dont get back up
yeah
yeah
i had to explain that to my
ive got a $unc$six year old now
and he
i have a $unc$fifteen year old and a $unc$seventeen year old
they understand now
yeah
ive taken time to teach them
and the young boy wants to know
and i told him youre a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and we would start with the b b gun deal
yeah
so he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows
and i took it away from him
i said now so hes learning the hard way
but at least it was a b b gun not a $unc$twenty-two or a $unc$four $unc$ten or something
so
i remember i had an old uncle up by $unc$tulsa $unc$oklahoma that took me out and showed me
it was my mothers uncle
this was a gentleman in his sixties
and he took me out with him and single shot $unc$twenty-two and taught me how to shoot
uh-huh
we went squirrel hunting
and he taught me how to shoot a old single shot $unc$twenty-two
all right
and i was probably about $unc$twelve at the time
uh-huh
and i thought that was the neatest thing
and of course $unc$uncle $unc$sam took me hunting with him
yeah
and he let me shoot and showed me how
all right
i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use $unc$one
right
i dont want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away
so
yeah
thats about all i
we agreed pretty well on this i think
yeah
i think so
okay
its been real nice talking with you
all right
have a good $unc$one
okay
bye
bye-bye
do you have children
yes
yes
i have a daughter
do you
yeah
how old is she
shes only about a little less than $unc$two years old
i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to promote a college or anything
no
ive got $unc$one thats $unc$seven and $unc$one thats $unc$three
so we started saving
but thats all
yeah
are you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school
no
no particular school
i think thats really a decision that
that you are going to let them make
they
help them make in terms of what they are wanting to do
right
uh-huh
thats a big influence i think and not only what you can afford but whats going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
so you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
yeah
where did you go to school
$unc$university of $unc$mississippi
oh
was that local or
it was within the state
uh-huh
but it was not necessarily local it was
yeah
but so whats
whats the criterion for choosing to go there
yeah
at the time i was thinking of going pre med
uh-huh
and in the state they had the best pre med curriculum for the state institutions
uh-huh
it was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive
uh-huh
yeah
at the time we really could not afford it
so i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me
yeah
it
i enjoyed it
did you commute everyday then
or
no
okay
no
no
it was a $unc$six hour drive
okay
when you said it was quite a way away i did not know that meant you had to drive like an hour
or
it was like another world
uh-huh
basically it was a
did not get home that often
and at that age its kind of difficult sometimes
yeah
yeah
especially if you have not been away a lot that extended
yeah
did you go there straight out of high school
yeah
yeah
i did not get my degree until later on
so i just finished mine a couple of years ago
uh-huh
and i guess when you have to do it that way it makes your choices a lot easier
but
thats true
yeah
thats like when i went on to get my masters it was where i was at the time
uh-huh
right
i was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled
right
right
and i was trying to work
so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
exactly
yeah
which group do you work in in $unc$t $unc$i
the computer science center
where is that at
north building
i see
how long do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
about $unc$three years
did you work somewhere else
sounds like you got your masters before here
or
yeah
i have
no
i came straight from school to here
i see
cause this was the first real job after getting my degree
uh-huh
after your masters or after your
after my masters
i see
my undergraduate degree was not in what my masters was
i see
so i made a career change basically
uh-huh
i see
lets see
i have not
theres a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools just like you said
depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that
so i have not really made up my mind whether to encourage them to go different places
yeah
or
$unc$one day i would like to the
i like the school where i went
uh-huh
and i would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to
right
right
or the school where i got my masters at which was a different school
right
and i liked it almost as well
uh-huh
but that im not going to hold them to that just because i went there
right
i think thats
yeah
if they want to thats fine but otherwise not although i would get quite a break on tuition
yeah
because you went there
yeah
because they allow for tuition break for out of state students who children of alumnae
i didnt know that
certain schools do it
yeah
this school does
so it
i was involved in some alumnae recruiting here in town last year
uh-huh
and it was kind of fun because you are trying to get people interested in your school
uh-huh
and they were
this was a college night at a high school in $unc$richardson
and it was
uh-huh
and there were a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools
there were a $unc$hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids
uh-huh
uh-huh
its kind of interesting to talk up your school
yeah
your own school
and i was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of our school and were interested in it
uh-huh
we
situations like that you dont realize until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
uh-huh
and so i was real pleased with that
that worked out so well
yeah
did you drum up any interest then
i think so
i dont know offhand
but it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there
uh-huh
so there was $unc$one mother who came by right even before we started who obviously was very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something
and that
and she was wanting some more information
but her daughter was a baton twirler or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
and she was letting us know how good her daughter was
she had business cards describing her daughters she had won several different twirling awards and all this
really
uh-huh
and she had these business cards she was passing out
and it was quite a production
i think some parents go a little bit overboard
yeah
it sounds like it
yes
i think $unc$richardson is probably $unc$one of the places that would definitely
okay
the topic is selecting care for the elderly
uh-huh
and i dont have elderly parents yet but not that far in the distant future
what about yourself
my parents are both in their seventies
my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies
and my father and stepmother are not in very good health
so this is something that is
a concern of yours right now
yes
it is
are they living independently right now
yes
they are
oh
they are
have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that
not for them my mother and stepfather have set up an arrangement where they have a large home and $unc$two of my sisters and their families $unc$one of thems husband and then all the children are living in this home
its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms
and they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen
and my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when $unc$one or the other of them might need care
and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home
that sounds the ultimate
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home
even at that point most care can be given in the home
that sound like just an excellent solution
you must feel real good about that
i felt good about it because thats my personal feeling also
i read a lot
and then i know people then have visited nursing homes and have had great grandparents in the nursing homes
and it was not a happy situation for any of them
and we have a very active nursing home here in $unc$plano that has activities going all the time
and they have
even the people that are wheelchair bound and really are incapacitated go and participate in olympics
uh-huh
and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair thats held annually at a big mall here
right
so there are a lot of activities going on all the time
and this is a nursing home
its not a senior citizens home
so that the people are really
really in need of a nursing home
right
they need the nursing care
right
uh-huh
but its a very expensive solution
its
i think we just listen to the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes
its just a matter of finding a good home
right
right
and then of course there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions
right
uh-huh
and that i think is what is scary
and i also feel that thats where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes
and they really can not afford the best
right
and thats right i took my husband $unc$one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation
and they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating
oh
and he apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so
but when the family came in to see him they had not been made aware
i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance
and i overheard their conversation
and when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son-in-law they were not even aware of what had happened
goodness
so i told them he strangled on some chicken
and the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or so
oh
and i thought
what a shame
they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
right
right
and then they could have done that well at home
and then she was upset
he had on $unc$two different shoes $unc$one of which was not even his
he had on a pair of slacks
oh
and the wife said these are not his slacks
and she said i just took $unc$two pair over yesterday for him that were clean
and
you hear these stories all the time
right
right
this was just something that i witnessed to
you happened
right
and at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in
and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
oh
and with just a curtain of course between us and
right
they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth
and he was definitely
just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of nursing home care
but the family were all talking about putting him in another home
they said he will not go back to that $unc$one
good
good
im glad they have a solution to do that
im glad they the option
yes
i know
i would hate to be in a position where that was all i could afford
and there was no choice
exactly
my ex-husbands grandmother had been in a nursing home now for it must be $unc$seven $unc$eight years
and its just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home
my
the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from people who have been independent all their lives
uh-huh
uh-huh
this was a really neat vital woman
and you get in a nursing home
and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life
right
right
and oh i do not know what the answer is
but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there
and i think it does
a lot of it goes down to just money and family support
thats right
if you have family that you can live with
visits everyday
right
right
right
i really
i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care
you would do your research
and you would go visit
visit
right
and hopefully they would have it so that you could go there anytime
right
because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit su-
suspicious
right
and i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time
but i guess alzheimers would come as close as anything
she really was not aware of what she was doing
uh-huh
and i can remember she had several strokes
and the nursing home was right next to a hospital
and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days
and it was just like keeping something
weve talked a little bit about the $unc$plano school system
i really have been pleased with $unc$plano
i have a child who
my son is learning disabled
uh-huh
and i thank $unc$god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into
is he the elementary school
hes in elementary school
uh-huh
and hes not severely learning disabled
uh-huh
hes being helped
but he is being helped
he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math
uh-huh
and they recently released him from resource which i was thrilled
great
i really was
i just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump
and hes in the $unc$herman $unc$method of $unc$reading
i dont know if youre familiar with that
no
thats something new to me
im
it is something new
and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
oh
i think i read about that in the paper
its wonderful
$unc$doctor $unc$haggard is heading that up
yes
and its wonderful
he didnt have a problem with reading
as a matter of fact hes reading on level
the problem was his spelling
and in watching the way he has struggled
uh-huh
its interesting because im convinced i have the same learning disability or had that was ignored
oh
and
right
so you learned how to solve your problems on your own
thats right
and so its not an intelligence problem
its just a problem with learning
has he had this since kindergarten
or is this something that maybe learning phonetics
and then he just didnt learn the right way
its funny
when he was in first grade he had trouble with spelling
uh-huh
and i would say to the teacher its amazing
he will be able to
youll say to him spell cat
and hell say c a t
and then he would go to write it
and he would write c o t
okay
and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here
something is wrong here
youre right
and the teacher kept saying he has a $unc$may birthday
hes just immature
right
second grade it was
i will
these teachers as far as im concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school i went up there
and i requested a conference because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy
good
good
thats great for parents to be involved
i was
and i went up there the second week of school
and i said something is wrong
and thank $unc$god the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
how great
it was
and she had picked it up
so she was able to zero in
yep
oh
she had already picked it up
and she said we were going to call you if you hadnt called us
we think theres a learning disability
and we think he needs to be tested immediately because once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested
and she said i think we can get him real fast
uh-huh
uh-huh
and sure enough they tested him
and he qualified for the help
and its been great
and i thank $unc$god im here because i know i have a sister who has the other extreme
she has a child in $unc$connecticut who is extremely gifted
and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
right
no
and to me thats the same thing
its like having a child who has a learning disability thats being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
but thats something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child
thats true
because thats something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home
thats true
uh-huh
but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult
uh-huh
and this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs that these students need
yes
right
right
and im not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them
exactly
and they dont take them
and if theyre a behavior problem theyre out
thats right
that
and this is kind of a rejection type of thing
right
uh-huh
and we get it even at our level in
i work a $unc$nine $unc$ten school
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the parochial and private schools
uh-huh
and they come in
and their attitude is im a bad boy and proceed to prove it
really
really
so i really hate that for them
i would rather they not have that attitude
yeah
but thats
when comparing test scores
i know recently i was in a discussion
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools
right
and that was $unc$one of the points that i made is that youre not comparing apples to apples
thats right
you cant say i know $unc$steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability into a private school which is too bad
uh-huh
but on the other hand i cant necessarily blame them they are a private school
no
and they can do whatever they want
thats right
they can be selective
right
and they
thats right
they have the ability to be selective
but you cant say then public schools are not as good
right
perhaps they are because theyre
if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable way
youre right
and i have a problem when they compare the kids in $unc$japan or $unc$germany to the kids here
in honesty the kids in $unc$japan they have to try out to even get to which kindergarten theyre going to get into
really
and then after
and if you only
in fact theyve had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably wont get into the top elementary and high school
uh-huh
and if they dont when they reach a certain age thats the end of their schooling
uh-huh
and they dont ever really go on
its only their top ones that go on like ours do
uh-huh
uh-huh
so that creates a problem
and you cant compare because they go so many more hours
yeah
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that childs education and is that child
right
you see that with the foreigners that come here
thats right
i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that these children they had to be the best
and they put off all social life all everything
thats right
thats right
is that good
yes
the child is very bright
but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road are more rounded
better coping skills
yes
sure
sure
i think its real important to have friends
i think its real important to play sports
i think its real important to be part of a team
right
and so thats why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine
we didnt do all that
right
we certainly didnt carpool and run the way i do
and you dont see the parents encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band
no
right
right
its strictly stick to the educational
and its interesting to see them as they get older then that is the type of adult they are
uh-huh
okay
yes
this is a very timely topic inasmuch as were going to a family reunion this weekend
are you really
yeah
where is it going to be
down at $unc$lake $unc$texoma lodge
oh
yes
this is $unc$one thats the $unc$baker family reunion
uh-huh
and this has been going on i would say at least $unc$twenty-five years or $unc$thirty something like that
thats marvelous
maybe longer than that im going to get back into the fifties sometime
uh-huh
first time i married into the family
and the first time i went was about $unc$fifty-seven i think
uh-huh
but this $unc$one has been well organized
and in fact it used to be at $unc$lake $unc$brownwood
and now its $unc$lake $unc$texoma because thats more central location for people from $unc$oklahoma and $unc$texas to come to
uh-huh
im sure locations really important as far as figuring out where $unc$one ought to be
very important because youll start losing people if its too far to go
uh-huh
we have factions when its $unc$one part
i have $unc$one reunion on my mothers side
and we found that if its in a certain part of $unc$texas some people come
and if its elsewhere other people come
yeah
we never get them at both of them
never get them at both places
it seems like
so i think we need to find a new place
right
listen theyve had this $unc$one
it just
of course over the years it has built up as far as the organization is concerned
uh-huh
but now they have a golf tournament on the $unc$saturday
and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on $unc$saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
thats a neat idea
yeah
and they get the community building there at $unc$lake $unc$texoma lodge
and everyone brings in food
uh-huh
and then for the $unc$saturday night dinner they bring in $unc$kentucky $unc$fried $unc$chicken from $unc$durant
and it really has worked out
uh-huh
how many people $unc$jim are involved
generally i think its been as high as about a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty people
wow
i think normals about $unc$sixty or $unc$seventy
yeah
i guess ours probably isnt that big
our family is dwindling for $unc$one thing
oh
and i often feel funny because im in a branch thats all but died
oh
i just have $unc$one aunt and my family
so sometimes when these other families get together theyre really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids
yeah
and were kind of off on the sidelines
but it does remind us that we have family and roots
right
so we keep going even though were not a real big part of it
yeah
our family reunion started out my wife
and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak
uh-huh
and now our children go
and our grandchildren are going now
thats great
so its wound up that were the old folks now
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they have various organized
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes to pitch
and they organize a baseball game for the kids
uh-huh
and several people bring boats
and theres a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon
so its a full day
so theres lots to do
some of the people come down on $unc$friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend
uh-huh
and some just come in for $unc$saturday
uh-huh
so it has worked out quite well
and its a chance to see some of the relatives you dont see all year long except that once a year
uh-huh
thats true
thats neat
i think theyre really fun
we go to mine regularly
and then we go to my husbands occasionally down in $unc$temple
and he has a large family
so its fun when we go to that $unc$one
yeah
my side of the family is from back in $unc$ohio and $unc$west $unc$virginia
and i think weve been to $unc$one in $unc$thirty-five years or something like that
so thats just too far away
oh
yeah
yeah
that is a problem with the distance
the people that we have that dont come are out $unc$el $unc$paso way
yeah
and its just too much for all of them all of that group to travel
its an all day drive just to get to this area
right
but then we have the same attitude when its out there although this year were going out
theyre going to have it at $unc$fort $unc$davis
yeah
and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
yeah
yeah
we have
each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion
uh-huh
and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president
we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and assembling of stuff
uh-huh
and choose some place that everybodys going to like as far as food and all that
right
thats correct
thats a heavy burden
yes
it is
i tell you
i dont really care for her to be president again
no
but its a lot of work
but its a lot of fun
uh-huh
weve enjoyed it
and the grandkids really enjoy it because its the only time of the year they see all their cousins from $unc$oklahoma
i think
yeah
and its good for kids to know that they have other family
yeah
and this year theyre all excited
the show this weekend
this weekends going to be a rock and roll show
boy
my $unc$two grandsons and $unc$one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song in jeans and t-shirts and such
what fun
uh-huh
so its going to be exciting for them and for us too
uh-huh
probably lots of laughs
yes
there have been some really wild shows put on there
they really get into it
uh-huh
it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along
ours is still kind of loosely organized
and the same people usually get stuck with doing it
yeah
that generally happens
and they do it as a labor of love
yeah
so the officer idea is a good idea
yeah
weve had various things over the years to raise funds for it
uh-huh
and again its not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such
yeah
but theyve come up with
uh-huh
theyve tried passing the hat
and theyve had auctions and various things to raise funds
and some people do
uh-huh
and some people dont
yeah
and its not fair that everybody not contribute
but anyway thats the family reunion story
uh-huh
okay
thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you
bye
been nice talking to you
bye
okay
all right
i am the product of i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone
my mother
we come from a
my mother and i were really first generation divorce in our family
yes
my mother was divorced in $unc$nineteen $unc$fifty-seven when i was $unc$seven years old
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i was the first $unc$one of anyone that anyone had ever known to have a divorce
uh-huh
of course now $unc$fifty percent divorces in the $unc$united $unc$states
my mother was treated very badly by a lot of family members especially from my fathers side of the family
and also we were ostracized by his family basically we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
uh-huh
right
and they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
mercy
it was always my mothers fault she was not sufficient she just was not good enough
what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest
it was that kind of an attitude
yeah
thats too bad
so
yeah
it was too bad
it was really rough
thats sad
it really is
so
some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of
uh-huh
i think that there are people i think that
i was first generation going to college in my family
uh-huh
first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career in a secretarial position
she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in $unc$des $unc$moines $unc$iowa
thats wonderful
she was a secretary to a federal judge
uh-huh
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him
so that was a really high status position
thats wonderful
she made over $unc$thirty $unc$thousand a year
that speaks well of your mother
yeah
she a real hard la-
she had high standards
yeah
yeah
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back
bless her heart
so i went to college and now since have completed $unc$two masters degrees
and i am the director of music in a church
but interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with
challenges
absolutely
uh-huh
challenges that have to do with my sex
right
for instance i am just not taken as seriously at professions as many of the men who are doing the same job i do
uh-huh
and the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly
they question my authority more than they ever would a man
and i have experience with this because i work both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
uh-
uh-huh
so i am pretty aware of what goes on in the church
surely
so basically thats
i am done talking
do you want to talk
i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well $unc$nickie
and i can relate to that
uh-huh
i think its the image that the woman has in the world as the lesser of the $unc$two
uh-huh
always
and i think things are changing
but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take
uh-huh
and i think we are progressing at a snails pace
indeed
but we are progressing
uh-huh
so thats the main point is that we are going ahead
uh-huh
and i think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve
uh-huh
and men a lot of them have come around and have seen the error of their ways
uh-huh
uh-huh
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change
uh-huh
so we have to face that reality also
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend why they can not just accept competent women
i have never been able to understand that
i guess its fear
what
it could be if they are not sure of themselves
sure
the ones that go along with that they are sure of themselves
uh-huh
and they know that they can be on the same level
uh-huh
and they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes we each have our jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal
uh-huh
uh-huh
men have a lot of trouble with that though
uh-huh
in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal
and so its really difficult for them to treat women as equals
they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower
it seems that they are more comfortable that way
and i do not know if its a militaristic point of view i guess
somebody can not be colonel
and everybody else is infantry
but its just really interesting to me
i am married to a wonderful man who treats me with as
i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time
but when he gets angry its always over control issues its always over power issues its never over its always you said you were going to do something
and you did not do it as if he is the boss
and i am the slave
uh-huh
and it
those are the only issues we ever fight about
i think its just difficult for men to accept women equally
even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss
dictatorships are real efficient
i guess we would have to go back to the way that the $unc$lord made us
and the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
and i believe that strongly
but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
and i think the issue should be settled before theres a conflict
and i think that can happen in a very wonderful way
and if we men and women would do as the $unc$bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves
uh-huh
can you picture that
uh-huh
if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
its true
and thats really the divine answer and the right answer
uh-huh
uh-huh
so that would be a beautiful relationship
uh-huh
it would be
and i think there are some people that have done that
uh-huh
and i have seen it
uh-huh
and its just marvelous
and i am just in awe to see this
i dont
i am only $unc$twenty-eight
and i havent had much experience with nursing homes
i have never visited any of them
and i dont think ive ever even been in $unc$one
have you
ive been in them but just visiting
and we used to g- when we were in our teen ages
wed go on $unc$sundays and visit the older people
but i have an elderly grandma that lives with us
uh-huh
and shes lived with us for $unc$five years
so i kind of know how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home
or weve had those discussions about should we put her in because shes pretty senile
and
and it takes a lot of care
$unc$twenty-four hours a day someone has to be theres someone in my fiancees family
yeah
its rea-
his grandmother too and theyre her son his uncle whatever
hes recently retired
and so hes the $unc$one who she moved in with when she had a stroke
and all the other children are working or whatever
uh-huh
theyre all my parents age
so hes got his retirement though is really $unc$twenty-four hours a day
they have a day care $unc$two days a week
they call it senior citizen day care
but she goes in the senior citizen center
really
so he gets a break $unc$two days a week
but its only for like $unc$two or $unc$three hours at a time
uh-huh
and just you see a lot of things like was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired
and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired hes not able to do now
right
but he refuses to consider any other
i dont
to put her in a rest home
yeah
and is that how your parents feel
or
its more my grandma that feels that way
uh-huh
she says that when her husband died that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home
so its kind of
i dont know
i dont think my parents would
but she is getting pretty bad
she has to have a little toilet right by her bed
and its
uh-huh
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much
so it gets
i dont know
its a hard decision
but i dont think i would do it to my parents personally
i know at this
i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either
but i really feel bad for the people i see th- not very
im not really experienced
but like i said i just have that $unc$one family
and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now
than he thought it would be
but
when he retired
yeah
and hes got $unc$seven brothers and sisters
and hes the $unc$one because hes the $unc$one that isnt going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone
and
yeah
its like that good for us just because my uncle and my mom switch off like we have her for $unc$three months
and then he has her for $unc$three months
thats great
so that works out good
thats a good idea
we ought to
yeah
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i dont know what theyre going to do
its really not my family
its my fiancees
so i cant say much
uh-huh
but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either
and i wonder im going to be the only sibling that isnt going to have children
so if my parents do need to live with someone it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for
really
and i
thats fine with me
my fiancee and i both figure thats whats were going to end up with both of the parents or whoever
if the-
you know what i mean
we feel like its our responsibility
uh-huh
and i feel like i would never put them in a home
but i wonder if $unc$one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something
uh-huh
you think about it
and its really
i dont know
this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country
you think
im not really familiar with how other countries
and its really more of like a respect issue that the older people in other countries that ive been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people
and they really seem as wise
and in this country nobody really pays attention
theyre seen as senile
and the old-timer made with the old way
and nobody respects the traditions
and its im not saying that i do either
but its just funny
right
and we really dont have any that dont have the $unc$social $unc$security
and everything really isnt that much for elderly people to live on
uh-huh
even if theyre in good health its incredible
right
they dont have any
they dont get special treatment and maybe they should because were all going to get old someday
uh-huh
i know
and so its kind of a depressing topic though
how old are you
im $unc$twenty
so and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother
yeah
it really is
and she drives us craz-
why dont you go ahead and say what you feel
and then ill respond
all right
im very guilty of not doing my part with recycling im afraid
we recently moved here from $unc$north $unc$carolina
and they had curbside recycling
and it was very easy to put everything out there
but we dont have it at least in our neighborhood right now
yeah
so ive been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong
how long have you been here
weve been here since $unc$january
so we still feel very new
but its working up to a year now
yeah
so i guess were old timers compared to some people
yeah
i think thats a good excuse
you need to get into the system a little more and know where to take things
right
yeah
weve been here probably $unc$two and a half years
and we didnt recycle at all before we came
uh-huh
so i think were doing well
we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
uh-huh
where do you take those things
the glass and the newspaper we usually take to $unc$walmart
in behind $unc$walmart they have bins
uh-huh
and then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money
where do you do that
because weve been saving cans for my daughters choir
uh-huh
but i didnt know where to take them
theres a place on $unc$parker $unc$road
its just over the overpass before you get to $unc$k-mart
i think theres a service station there
theres usually a semi truck that has a person there that will weigh them
and now they arent worth much right now
oh
but its better than nothing
yeah
so
better than nothing
right
and what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now
and hopefully well be getting them in the month of $unc$october
yeah
i
it seems like ever since weve moved here weve been hearing that its coming in a couple of months
yeah
and i think its been delayed
but
i think it was originally scheduled for $unc$february
but the trucks that were supposed to do it theres been some problems with from what ive read in the mail that we get
oh
right
and i cant wait for that
that will be easy
i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
yeah
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off
but
i feel guilty we dont recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
theyre a lot of bulk anyway
yeah
yeah
yeah
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can
right
so ill be glad when the bins do come
and i think thats when ill start doing the plastic too
yeah
it was real easy with the bins
it really was
it was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage
so
yeah
ive gotten used to washing the salad dressing bottles and things like that
right
its not that big of a deal
and its nicer to just throw them out
but we can do our part take an extra minute or $unc$two
yeah
how much do you earn on the cans
i didnt know what kind of an idea to give her for
when we first were here it was like wed take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe $unc$two grocery sacks full
uh-huh
and it would be like $unc$two dollars but since last time weve gotten more like a dollar
yeah
so its gone down
yeah
yeah
which is understandable
i think more people are recycling
right
yeah
thats something we dont really make any effort to
and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter the cans
uh-huh
and that was kind of fun
but we havent done that for a long time
yeah
that sounds like a pretty good project
the boys think its fun plus you get your exercise
and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest
oh
but
ill have to keep myself and get on it
my neighbor across the street is so careful about recycling
and so i keep telling myself ill get it organized
but maybe theyll beat me and do the city wide first
hopefully the bins will be here in this month
and that will spur you on
so
right
right
i wont have any excuse then
thats for sure
all right it sounds like were doing our part and at least starting trying
thinking about it anyway
thats all you can do
yeah
but have you
do they time this thing for us
or do we
yeah
you can do it as long as you want
they
if its been long enough $unc$five minutes is when they cut in and say we dont have any more room for recording
you cant chat all day
so we can say good-bye now
okay
it was good talking to you
and maybe well get on line again
okay
thanks $unc$sherry
bye-bye
bye-bye
do you have any pets
yes
i do
i have a dog named $unc$grisly whos a $unc$ten year old mixed breed between $unc$golden $unc$retriever $unc$afghan $unc$hound and $unc$chow
oh
and i have a pair of box turtles
i used to have box turtles years ago when i was growing up
yeah
i really like them
yeah
i do too
$unc$lucky and $unc$spot thats their names
oh
and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room
and my dog thinks hes a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box
so do you have any pets now
yes
we have $unc$one dog a $unc$bichon $unc$frise
our friends in $unc$houston bred the dogs
i had never heard of them
no
i havent either
theyre all white
and theyre small and fluffy
they dont shed
i guess theyre distantly related to a poodle
but theyre not very well known in this country
and theyre not high strung or over bred
oh
and how big do they get
ours is on the small end
and shes about $unc$ten pounds
and they range from probably $unc$ten to $unc$sixteen pounds
thats interesting
and they love people and kids
and that was something we were looking for
our love is $unc$golden $unc$retrievers
and thats what we had intended to get in $unc$houston
but we had a small yard and a pool
and knowing how they love to dig and love the water we thought that was kind of a tough climate
ye-
the water
yes
yeah
so we ended up getting this
and my son would rather have a $unc$golden $unc$retriever though i think
oh
now he wants a good size dog
uh-huh
weve got a good size dog
and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and because we used to have a miniature $unc$dachshund
and i miss having a little $unc$one around
oh
yeah
the kind you have sounds very interesting though
theyre really sweet dogs
we thought probably our neighborhood in $unc$houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of the family that had them and bred them
they had $unc$five litters of puppies
and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
oh
uh-huh
because
and how do you spell that breed
its $unc$b $unc$i $unc$c $unc$h $unc$o $unc$n $unc$f $unc$r $unc$i $unc$s $unc$e
$unc$f $unc$r $unc$i $unc$s $unc$e
and how do you pronounce that
$unc$bichon $unc$frise
okay
im writing it out phonetically
yeah
theyre
and they dont shed
so theyre good dogs for people with allergies
yes
and they love people
and theyre
do they bark a lot
no
not really
ours barks more than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house
we used to swap back and forth dogs
they have $unc$three dogs
they had a $unc$cockapoo and $unc$two $unc$bichons
uh-huh
and she didnt bark at all until she spent time there
oh
and now its funny
shes a good watch dog
uh-huh
and if theres shell bark that way
but she also talks a lot
she has a definite personality
yes
and so if were leaving her she barks at us because she doesnt want to be left
oh
does she ever mess in the house
no
no
and theyre very smart dogs
the circuses in $unc$europe used to use them for the acts
oh
theyll dance on their hind legs each
uh-huh
gee
but theyre very easy to train
uh-huh
and
and about how much are they
they range
id noticed up here theyre a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper
they run anywhere from $unc$two $unc$hundred to $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot
and how about the person in $unc$houston
shes no longer breeding them
oh
but because her dogs the second $unc$one that she has was $unc$one of the puppies from the litter
and the $unc$one male that she used had a tooth problem
uh-huh
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as pets they werent show quality
yes
just pets
yes
thats what wed rather have is just a pet instead of
ri-
we used to show $unc$saint $unc$bernards when i was a little girl
we did that every weekend
but takes a lot of time
yes
and its very expensive
yeah
but she might have some contacts here
i know that the dogs grandmother was from $unc$plano
thats where i live
thats where i live too
yeah
im at $unc$coit and $unc$legacy
so what do you think about it
i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in $unc$america and then went back and said if there is a problem what should we do about it
right
yeah
i guess thats so
do you feel theres a problem with immigration in $unc$america
i think theres some problems
but theyre not really big ones
i think that in general the whole immigration policy isnt quite as open as it should be
that its really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if theyre educated and will be a good asset to $unc$america
its often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that
okay
thats interesting
i was wondering what your response would be
im a first generation $unc$american
okay
so im from immigrant parents or an immigrant mother anyway
where did you come from
okay
okay
so where did your parents come from
$unc$poland
okay
and
and that was prior to $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two
uh-huh
but its interesting that with the topic i think i agree with you
yeah
there needs to be more of an open policy
uh-huh
and we have to remember the $unc$chinese came here and were our labor for the $unc$transatlantic $unc$railroad
and our $unc$irish came and built the towns and did labor
yep
uh-huh
but what do you think
are you from $unc$texas
or
im from $unc$pennsylvania
$unc$pennsylvania
okay
yeah
that will be interesting
right
and a lot of
because we have just had a $unc$naturalization $unc$act where the $unc$mexicans that were residents in $unc$texas im from $unc$texas have become citizens now
uh-huh
yeah
what do you think about that
i think thats all right
i
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing
do you have an opinion about it
i agree with it wholeheartedly
uh-huh
the only thing is ive got to share with you my background is from $unc$new $unc$jersey
uh-huh
so when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a $unc$texan im talking to
no
okay
because texan philosophy is a little different
right
a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law whos chinese and immigrated from $unc$china
and he got a green card and is in good standing in $unc$america and $unc$china but only because he was always nice to the chinese government and all that
uh-huh
and he was always on pretty good terms with them
yeah
we
but their
my sister just had a baby
and theyre trying to get permission for his mother to come to $unc$america to help care for the kid and that sort of thing
and its turned out to be sort of a horrible problem
its just very difficult to get a woman who doesnt have a lot of assets or whatever out of $unc$china even temporarily to visit here
then you have first in the experience on immigration
yeah
that is interesting
uh-huh
yeah
i wonder even with those that were involved with tienamens $unc$square
right
did we really protect them
yeah
and i think thats pretty crazy because those students who were in $unc$america when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back
yeah
and aside for that theyre the best and brightest of $unc$china
so its certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can
that is true
that is true
what do you think about
yeah
we have in $unc$texas a large vietnamese population that has been brought in
uh-huh
yeah
what do you think about that
and these are not the brightest
these are refujees you mean
were talking boat people
okay
right
okay
we have a lot of boat people in $unc$texas
right
i dont have any problem with that
youre a true liberal heart-to-heart
good for you
yeah
i guess so
i was ready for a fight on this $unc$one
uh-huh
right
no
i agree because
uh-huh
interesting when my daughter was in high school $unc$one of the custodians was vietnamese
yeah
and with his limited $unc$english she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor
all right
so we started recording already
i guess
i dont know
its the first time ive made a phone call on it
so you pressed $unc$one
right
okay
so i guess were supposed to start talking
what kind of books do you read
i read a lot of $unc$steven $unc$king $unc$dean $unc$r $unc$koontz some $unc$danielle $unc$steel
uh-huh
my aunt got me hooked on those
uh-huh
so i
so its mostly all novels
yeah
theyre all novels
okay
ill read some classic too
like what
like the graduate by $unc$steinbeck
ill
yeah
i like that
i like $unc$steinbeck a lot
a rose family by $unc$faulkner thats $unc$one of my favorites
i have never read a lot of $unc$faulkner
and this is more of a play or something that it was from that i saw
and i read the book from that
cool
and by the way my names $unc$bill
im from $unc$north $unc$carolina
im $unc$doug
im from $unc$pennsylvania
i
lets see
what kind of books do you like to read
a bunch of stuff i guess fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones
and i dont really like the $unc$six $unc$hundred page long $unc$stephen $unc$king novels and all that
i really have to be in the mood
right
i read $unc$one like maybe once a year
uh-huh
im not as
no
i like $unc$richard $unc$broudigan a lot
ive never read anything by him
okay
hes dead now
but he was really a pretty amazing writer
he wrote books that were pretty short and pretty easy to read written at a third grade level or whatever
yeah
but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny
he wrote trout fishing in $unc$america
okay
so thats
and i read a lot of non fiction books too
lets see
i like to read a lot of non fiction history $unc$civil $unc$war era and that kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
i found that real interesting
im reading the lion and the wind right now
and that was on t v
now whats that
it was during $unc$teddy roosevelts time and about a american woman that got kidnapped in $unc$morocco
uh-huh
yeah
this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
uh-huh
and $unc$teddy $unc$roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man
yeah
surprised me
i had no idea that he was like that
uh-huh
how crazy
just like one quote that he had was that he thought the americas emblem was stupid because it was an eagle
and it should be a grizzly bear because
sh-
the grizzly and stuff like that
so its
i saw the movie
and thats what made me want to read the book
uh-huh
$unc$candice $unc$bergen was in the movie
im a real big fan of hers
so
yeah
cool
i also read a lot of books about music because im interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
uh-huh
i like to read some of the philosophy stuff
uh-huh
lets see
and even like reading some new age things things that i dont quite believe in
here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body
yeah
i think that
its all about how to have out of body experiences and all that
im fascinated by that
yeah
im fascinated by that
uh-huh
yep
that
and even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses
uh-huh
i like
im kind of a doubting $unc$thomas
and i like to read stuff like that
some of it really freaks me out
yeah
uh-huh
right
definitely
and i like to read some self help books
i read dianetics once i got past all the gibberish on it
did you like it
it was okay
it took me a while to really get into it
it didnt help me that much
uh-huh
i see
but i think once youre set in your ways youre set in your ways
yeah
then i
$unc$one real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
i read how to get the job that you wanted
and it had real good tips
and it
and i got the job that i wanted by applying the methods that
uh-huh
okay
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year
where im from the $unc$atlantic $unc$coast $unc$conference is a very big conference
and course we have $unc$duke $unc$university that was the national champions last year
so im kind of hoping that theyll repeat again this year
they have a lot of the same players back
is this the $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a
no
this is college basketball
this is college okay
right
we have like $unc$carolina and $unc$duke and $unc$georgia $unc$tech and $unc$n $unc$c $unc$state teams that are normally ranked in the top $unc$twenty
uh-huh
so hopefully well have a good year
i dont really follow the $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a very closely
and thats probably all i saw
we have moved in the last couple years from $unc$utah to $unc$texas
and theres so many colleges and universities in $unc$texas we havent really followed them too much
and none of them are our $unc$alma $unc$mater
so that seems to help
do you like professional basketball
i follow it especially around the playoffs
so course i was real familiar with the $unc$utah $unc$jazz
and the $unc$mailman or $unc$karl $unc$malone was pretty big thing
and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
yeah
i did keep track a little bit of the $unc$mavericks
theyve not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with $unc$tarpley
and maybe now that thats over theyll come out of it
but
thats an up and coming team though
yeah
i hope they do something
they need to
or theyre not going to have any of the team left at all
thats somebody you can get behind and be patient
yeah
kind of like the $unc$cowboys i guess
yeah
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
yeah
they coming out of it this year
well see if its held on
but i think $unc$chicago will probably with the $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a again
the $unc$bulls
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
theyll probably be pretty good
course the $unc$celtics are always really good too with their players
thats true
be interesting to see how the $unc$olympics does this year with all the $unc$n $unc$b $unc$a players playing on the $unc$olympic team
thats true
it will be interesting
it will certainly be different
yeah
i dont know how close ill follow them though
and the season hasnt started yet
im usually more the end of the season person
and we need to talk about baseball
and so
yeah
my $unc$atlanta $unc$braves
i really do
the basketball seasons supposed to start in the next couple of weeks
its
yeah
yeah
its a long season
it is
and thats why ive
i guess my mind went blank
its like last season was so long ago
and i havent really even started thinking about basketball yet
so
yeah
but this wasnt a good subject
but well see how our predictions come true
its a little early
we definitely will
okay
its good talking to you
good to talk to you
all righty
bye
bye-bye
i guess my personal opinion i dont mind paying taxes necessarily
i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way
right
sometimes when i hear even what the politicians are making when theyre getting a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand plus benefits and that i think thats just a bit too much to be paying them
and thats all tax money
when you figure out how many politicians and each $unc$one getting that much its just billions of dollars
thats i think is just being thrown away
right
right
and then when you read about that theyre spending all the money on these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too
yeah
but somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what were paying its not that we mind paying taxes its that were paying too much for a lousy government
yeah
and i tend to agree with that
yeah
im not really into what theyre doing $unc$per $unc$se
yeah
and i think theres just too many levels of bureaucracy
i think it can be managed by less levels
yeah
yeah
i know any time theres a big budget cut
i work with the state
and any time there is a budget cut or crunches its always the small guy that gets hurt
right
its never the person thats making a $unc$hundred $unc$thousand there
its always the person thats making the least amount
and sometimes were running around there
right
i see these supervisors running around having meetings
i really dont know what they do
right
i sometimes wonder are they really doing anything
or
right
i think were going to see a streamlining in the government
i just
i dont know what level or how long it will take for the public in general to start saying hey this is too much were not going to pay any more were not going to pay for this
and youre out
i think were starting to see it a little bit now
but i think i dont know what kind of input were going to get from the public and how theyre going to go about doing it
because i think were just getting taxed way too much
yeah
right now were getting taxed probably around $unc$thirty-five percent or more
and thats me not making a whole lot of money
yeah
they got so many hidden taxes that its really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and youre paying a little tax here
and you
right
so
gas i dont know about you guys
but theres probably at least about $unc$twenty-five to $unc$thirty cents of different taxes on our gas
right
and you dont realize
yeah
we got a sales tax
our sales tax is like $unc$eight percent
and i dont know what our gas tax is
i think its somewhere around $unc$twenty $unc$five cents a gallon
yeah
so theyre hitting us up
and they may not raise it federally as much $unc$one year
but then theyll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
its just you can see that your money is just not going that far
yeah
i know like with $unc$reagan they say no new taxes
but they changed the deductions on you
and that just raises your taxes they just get it a different way
right
so to me it did raise my taxes
right
you could tell just by how much money you have left over
and all of a sudden i dont know its eating me alive
yeah
i heard someone say that if they would just something with the defense budget all that extra money theyre throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars on an average $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars
okay
ill let you start this time
how much do you like lawn and garden work
even though its totally out of my degree training ive been working in the horticultural aspect the last i dont know $unc$fifteen $unc$twenty years im
oh
for goodness sakes
what do you do
i work for the state as a grounds keeper
uh-huh
thats interesting
so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work
no
mostly snow removal which weve had a lot of
but i dont know
i guess growing up on the farm and that ive always had a big interest
right
when i have an area to do i always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and everything
uh-huh
i love to work outside really
and i enjoy flowers and stuff
i dont do a whole lot of it at this exact point in my life because i have $unc$two teenage boys
and so they do all the lawn care
okay
but i still take care of the flower beds and things like that
i was even planning to go out and to dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but were planted in the ground since last spring
uh-huh
and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me
and lo and behold about $unc$five days ago we had a freeze down to about $unc$twenty-three degrees or something
uh-huh
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist
thats terrible
$unc$twenty-three de-
and i really feel bad about it
its a plant that weve had for probably $unc$twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of
yeah
yeah
so theyre all gone at this point
gardening in $unc$texas is really interesting though
i grew up in $unc$illinois
yeah
and $unc$texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry
why everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has watering system
uh-huh
and so with that why our lawns do stay pretty nice all summer if you water
uh-huh
but in the winter we have $unc$bermuda grass
uh-huh
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
right
yeah
and i just think its ugly
when i go back home to my parents in $unc$illinois in the winter their grass is fairly green
uh-huh
yeah
thats $unc$one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant
i think the $unc$saint $unc$augustine and centipede grass is another $unc$one you have quite a bit of down there
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
those $unc$two
yeah
some people have i think its fescue that stays green all winter
yeah
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
they have to water an incredible amount
but those lawns look nice during the winter
but they almost stick out like i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb
but when you look at the neighborhoods theyre all brown except the $unc$one
its sort of like
i know my folks live in $unc$arizona there
and they just grow rocks
right
so i know i was in $unc$houston when i was working for a company once
and we were taking care of lawns out there
and that particular year they had just tons of rain
it was raining continuously
uh-huh
and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
yes
thats true
yeah
$unc$houston is a lot wetter than $unc$dallas area
thats where $unc$plano is
and humidity just all the time its an awfully lot more humid
uh-huh
are you able to get sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden
yes
uh-huh
i think people do
yeah
i dont have a vegetable garden
i guess i never have here actually
but yes
uh-huh
we have $unc$neil $unc$sperry talks on the radio
okay
so what do you guys having up there
i havent been up there since $unc$forty-eight i guess
$unc$forty-eight
thats a long time
no
it wasnt $unc$forty-eight
lets see it was $unc$forty-eight
i was in the $unc$air $unc$force
uh-huh
we did an air show out at $unc$andrews
$unc$andrews
yeah
so whats it been like up there
for the past week or $unc$two its been cold and wet
uh-huh
but before that for most of the year its been hot and dry
yeah
like $unc$september was hot and dry
$unc$october
$unc$september really was
im not sure about $unc$october
i think for about $unc$twelve months through $unc$september the average temperature has been higher than normal each month lots of $unc$ninety degree days during the summer
really
it really has been strange here this year
course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than $unc$one
uh-huh
but we have all these
somebody said youre either a stranger or a fool to try to predict $unc$texas weather
but always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever
uh-huh
and we had all this rain
and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool
but all of a sudden in $unc$october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
and then the end of $unc$october it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down
there were flash floods everywhere that kind of deal
and then into of $unc$november the first week actually we had a freeze
uh-huh
and the average first frost is like the fifteenth of $unc$november here
if you had it early
but usually its not until later
its really strange
yeah
i think we usually have a frost in $unc$october
yeah
but we really need the rain that weve been getting
and it has not today
but the last few days its been pouring most of the day
is it flooding anywhere
flooding anywhere
i have not heard of any problems of it flooding anywhere
thats occurred certainly at times in the past
but no
ive not heard of any particular problems this time
its just kind of clou-
were supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be a little bit more typical autumn weather but really its strange
we havent really had an autumn
its like we went into winter
yes
the poor trees said what
yes
yeah
we had summer lasting long
then it became winter like today its sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
yeah
its
yeah
there you
usually theres
i have a farm a $unc$hundred miles east of here in $unc$east $unc$texas
and all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to $unc$maine
its that same trees pines and hard woods hickories and oaks and stuff
yeah
and i was up there last weekend
and there are trees that still have their leaves on
and theyre green
but theyre dead
the freeze just got them
they werent ready for it at all apparently
and we havent had a typical fall at all
not much color changes have occurred at all
really weird this year
im not sure what that means
i dont know
yeah
our leaves are all on the ground now
i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors
so you all actually had some color
yeah
yeah
it kind of crept in
and
yeah
we did for a time
yeah
its usually beautiful up there isnt it
uh-huh
gorgeous
thats
i think you could drive along in $unc$maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the pines and what not
and you could be driving along in $unc$east $unc$texas and looks just the same
its almost identical kind of country
uh-huh
beautiful
been that this year for the trees for the leaves
yeah
oh
yeah
i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend
so
little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it
yeah
thats because it cant tolerate a freeze this early
is that right
if it would came later it would be all right
theres some trees
the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy
theres
nothing bothers them
their leaves are still green
and there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves
what i notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look they got bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit
but they still look pretty good
it just depends on the tree
okay
its not often you get many women interested in football
do you follow football very much
im sorry what
do you follow football very much
i dont
no
i havent recently
we can talk about something else
do you have any
you married
no
im not
no
no
i guess kids are out
whats that
kids are out
yep
are you married
yeah
im married
got $unc$two boys
really
yeah
wow
so do you like football
i follow the $unc$cowboys
but thats about it
the same here
yeah
do you live in $unc$dallas
yeah
i am a pretty big $unc$dallas fan been for a long time
yeah
but i havent been to any games recently
but i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
really
yeah
have you ever been to a cowboys game
i havent
huh-uh
its pretty nice
we decided just to watch them at home
but
thats good
at least you follow the game a little bit
yeah
yeah
im not a fanatic about it
i dont know who played when and who does what like some guys are
i just like to watch
and hopefully they win
uh-huh
thats about the extent of it
yeah
right now im in college
so im more into college football than professional i think
i see
what school are you going to
im at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
$unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
okay
yeah
so
$unc$leslie what are you studying
nursing
nursing
great
yeah
my moms an $unc$l $unc$v $unc$n
really
yeah
so what are you planning to go into
do you want to be an $unc$r $unc$n
or
yeah
yeah
i havent really picked a field
i dont know ive thought a lot about labor and delivery
but i dont know
uh-huh
try that
thats what my mom does labor and delivery
really
wow
yeah
she loves it
she really enjoys
is she a nurse in $unc$dallas
no
shes a nurse in $unc$san $unc$antonio
oh
but shes been working on a late shift
she works i guess the graveyards what youd call it
uh-huh
she works the graveyard shift
and shes worked that for years when i was small
i guess probably going on $unc$twenty years now
wow
and she really enjoys it
she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
and she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives
uh-huh
and shes really enjoying herself
she really likes it
thats great
good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
thanks
hope youll like it
yeah
do you plan on staying in the $unc$dallas area
id like to come back to $unc$dallas
right now im in $unc$utah of course
uh-huh
so
but my familys there
so
yeah
id like to go back
yeah
i think $unc$texas $unc$san $unc$antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals
i dont know about $unc$dallas
i think $unc$dallas is pretty scattered
are you in $unc$san $unc$antonio
no
im in $unc$dallas
okay
but im originally from $unc$san $unc$antonio
and theyve got large medical center down there
theyve got the $unc$u $unc$t $unc$health $unc$science $unc$center out there also
right
so if ever wanted pursue anything more than your nursing degree thatd be the place to do it
yeah
my brother-in-law is in the medical profession hes at medical school in $unc$san $unc$antonio right now
great
great
yeah
like i said good luck to you
thanks
all right
take care
and maybe well meet up again some time
all right
okay
bye-bye
hello
hi
hi
my name is $unc$donna $unc$donahue
and i live in $unc$plano $unc$texas
hi
my name is $unc$lowell
and i live in $unc$raleigh $unc$north $unc$carolina
okay
do you want to start
or should i start
go right ahead
okay
i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in
we have $unc$three children
and they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball
and my little girl goes to tap dance
and my little one goes to preschool
and im home with the children just do a lot of running around
it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type i dont know life
what about you
im single
and i live in a town home here in $unc$raleigh
uh-huh
and its pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
uh-huh
okay
we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes
uh-huh
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally
im not home a lot
i travel a great deal with my job
uh-huh
so it was easier to have a home that somebody else looks out for the maintenance
was sort of maintenance free
yeah
yeah
that sounds pretty good for
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds
and its a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it
its
it certainly is
sometimes i think it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility
if you ever get $unc$one be sure the walls are good and thick because if theyre not you can hear
thats the main thing when i was shopping for $unc$one
i wanted to make sure i couldnt hear my neighbors
and that was
right
so i bought $unc$one thats more like living in a
once youre inside you dont know youre in a town home
that sounds lovely
it is
theyre kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
uh-huh
so you dont actually hear anybody next door to you
uh-huh
so in your area then theres probably a lot of career type people that have those type homes
and
yes
definitely
uh-huh
and the area that were settled in is definitely young families with kids
theyre still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood
so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which were from the northeast
and seems like a people also dont have any family around
so it also gives you a common bond when you dont have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors
but
we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who dont want the heat of $unc$florida but dont want the cold of the northeast
uh-huh
so they settle sort of in-between
right
right
uh-huh
is it very wooded around where you are
there lots of pretty trees and
yes
yeah
as a matter of fact this particular community that i live in is very wooded
how pretty
it is nice
i do miss that
around here in $unc$plano there are very few trees
and its pretty flat and kind of barren
and thats the only thing that we dont like about living in $unc$texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall
and the landscape is much different here in $unc$texas than it is in the north or even where you are
we definitely have a lot of trees here
a lot of leaves to rake up too i bet
yes
but fortunately the home owners association does all that
does that
thats another plus
yes
i dont have to worry about that
and this is the time of year were starting to lose
theyre all falling now
thats right
thats right
they are
im going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not much just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks
and if you didnt do anything about it then theyd probably the leaves just blow away
right
its not too bad
okay
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time
no
i dont think so
okay
okay
it was really nice speaking to you
it was good to speak with you too
okay
and have a happy $unc$thanksgiving
thank you
you too
bye-bye
bye-bye
the way
ill go ahead and start
the way i dress for work this year $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety-one has been really suit and tie
uh-huh
or i shouldnt say suit but coat and tie every day
uh-huh
a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess its a different set of standards i guess
yeah
so i dress almost the same every day
pretty much its a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it was very different before
how do you dress
im a drafter
so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and i have sweatshirt on today
uh-huh
and thats pretty much the norm for me
if i come in a dress everybodys shocked
yeah
i understand
they ask me what are you doing in a dress
and its usually i havent done my laundry lately
right
ran out of jeans
i understand
thats funny
so does it change
no
your dress
no
no
huh-uh
or i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that
no
huh-uh
so back in my old job up until through $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like
uh-huh
but probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit for a customer presentation or something
yeah
yeah
yeah
every now and then ill get dressed up and come in
but thats for my husbands job and not mine
i see
i understand
i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him
but so
thats interesting
lets see what else about this
it seems like $unc$t $unc$i is pretty cut and dried with $unc$two or $unc$three levels
uh-huh
theres the upper management that always wears gray suits and the people that dont
uh-huh
if i want to say dont have power or dont have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i guess you are
uh-huh
that we dress in the jeans
and then theres kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but theres not much
middle of the road
its nice that theres not a requirement for it
uh-huh
uh-huh
sometimes i think there should be
some of these women around here look like they came off of $unc$harry $unc$hines
yeah
right
yeah
i guess you see those once in a while
and they have the no shorts deal
and some of these mini skirts are worse than shorts ever thought about being
sure
but i guess thats $unc$one of the things you got to put up with when you dont have a dress code
yeah
thats right
thats right
i guess isnt there a dress code something about spaghetti straps
im not even sure what they are
supposedly and backless things
backless
all right
but ive seen those too
but
okay
so this wasnt necessarily a big conversation
but i think we did it
yeah
okay
and your name was $unc$lisa
$unc$lisa
great
are you the expressway sites
i am
yes
and i work in the north building
okay
thank you
thank you
all right
good day
uh-huh
bye-bye
advice on son or daughter going to college
right
thats advice that i will need in time future for my children rather than $unc$one that i have personal experience with
uh-huh
i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs
uh-huh
right
lets see
when i went away to school im trying to think my criteria
i guess when youre $unc$eighteen or so it would be important to know if it was a coed college
that was a strict requirement for me
again how serious a person is according to what they want to get out of school i guess theyd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home
lets see
what was the question
whats the criteria for picking a college
what advice would you give
what advice
okay
i guess $unc$one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus
yes
stay in a dormitory if you can
go to classes
talk to faculty members and students
yes
and also depending on how adjustable your child would be or flexible i guess it would be
if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe they were unused to the way they run things
the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges i think
the people are different
and you have to be more flexible and more willing to adjust to other peoples mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what youre used to
yes
im thinking what problems my children might have in that
you think so
but i agree with you
lets see
what else
climate would be
youd have to
uh-huh
is somewhat
if its something different than the $unc$one theyre used to i guess
if theyre used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be in studying if youre in $unc$florida or $unc$california
id also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then theyd have to get a loan to continue
yeah
course it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness $unc$one to work during the summer or part time and to take out loans to assume debt after college
thats right
theres
the responsibility of that
and they could work and earn money towards college
also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid
or its a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school
yes
and like i said if they was willing to work in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is
by the time i have an $unc$eleven year old is my oldest
so its not too far away
but its
mine is $unc$twelve
okay
but its getting there
we still definitely can put away the money for college now
i would advise that they did not have a car at college
they would
thats my gut feeling too
i
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
hello
yes
im here
yeah
yes
i didnt have a car in college
i think its more a burden to provide for
no
i think so too
i think because most kids dont have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
and i think its just trouble waiting to happen
so i would advise they didnt take a car
and they didnt take a television
is it
and they didnt take a refrigerator
maybe that
i didnt do any of those though
i feel less strongly about the t v and refrigerators
no
i
yeah
we didnt have
let me see
what have you seen lately
city slickers and star trek $unc$five
$unc$five
yeah
yeah
y-
only $unc$five
yeah
i thought id better see that $unc$one before i go and see $unc$six
no
didnt need to
no
i found that out
how about yourself
i just saw the latest $unc$one
how is it
it was fantastic
i cant wait
yeah
its
the lines in there were just perfect
it was classic trek
does the old star trek guys meet the new guys
no
huh-uh
no
its just the old guys still
yeah
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time
however the rumor is that it will happen next time
so
you know that i read in it was $unc$u $unc$s $unc$a $unc$today
uh-huh
that they said they werent going to do anymore
that was it
uh-huh
but
yeah
except that the rumor is that they still might
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
im not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was
i think its a $unc$hundred years
somewhere in that range
considering that $unc$spock was on couple weeks ago and that the very first episode of next generation they had $unc$mccoy
thats right
is that right
he was a doctor still
and
uh-huh
yeah
he was rear admiral whatever
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow
$unc$vulcans age a lot better
yeah
he didnt look too bad did he
no
huh-uh
matter of fact he looks about as old and the next generation as he does in the latest star trek
imagine that
yeah
thats amazing
but did they have some pretty good special effects
excellent excellent special effects
but i think the script was just incredible compared to the last one
yeah
the script was bad bad bad
you know why
no
i dont
why
$unc$william $unc$shatner wrote it
is that right
and even worse he directed it
$unc$leonard $unc$nimoy he does a lot better
yeah
in fact he didnt direct this $unc$one
he produced this $unc$one
but he directed the $unc$one before i think star trek $unc$four something like that
journey home i think that was
yeah
uh-huh
youre a real life trekkie
l-
i think so
i really like them
i wouldnt go so far as being a trekkie
but
uh-huh
ive gone to $unc$one for real live $unc$trek $unc$convention
but
really
yeah
i saw $unc$james $unc$doohan the guy that plays $unc$scotty
did you get to talk to him
no
it was crowded
not in a crowd like that
huh-uh
no
it was like want an autograph want to stand in line for about $unc$four hours
yeah
wow
it was a pretty crowded place
they have some good management principals in this new generation
yeah
yeah
i
its kind of funny
i was reading in a book trying to think
i cant quite remember the name of the book
but it was saying dont do star trek management style
and they were referring to $unc$captain $unc$kirk
every time he left the $unc$enterprise everything went to hell
oh
and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
right
so he kind of was a cowboy type too
uh-huh
made all the decisions
but $unc$jean $unc$luke does more of a committee type of management
uh-huh
yeah
its definitely a lot better a lot more realistic really
what other movies have you seen
saw the $unc$addams family last week
how was that
it was pretty good
there were a few things different than the old series
but on the whole it was pretty similar and a lot of fun
lots of little funny spots
yeah
yeah
did they have $unc$thing
and
yes
in fact $unc$thing has a much bigger role than he does in the series
there is lots of areas where $unc$thing saves the day
really
and he runs around a lot
how did
ive always wondered how he gets around
just finger hopping
but hes in a box right
no
no
no
in fact its funny
he never does come in out of a box i dont think
yeah
he was just kind of walking around
didnt he used to
not really
he was always in the box before
oh
thats okay
yeah
yeah
thats what i was thinking
do you do any recycling
we do here
what do we recycle
they recycle
they have bins
yeah
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles
and i think thats all they have
oh
what about you guys
we
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans
uh-huh
but weve got a couple of different places
theyre like unattended aluminum can smashers
and you can go up there and redeem
weve got $unc$one that gives you a penny a can
so if you
really
yeah
for smashed cans
you have to put them in there unsmashed
uh-huh
and when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
can you hold on for just a minute
sure
im going to try pressing $unc$one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because just succeed
okay
okay
okay
i guess
i heard it that time
yeah
okay
anyways you guys only get a penny a can
when you buy canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
no
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
yeah
exactly
and so its like they charge you for the deposit
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed youre just reimbursed
okay
type of thing
okay
no
they dont charge us that extra nickel
thats sort of nice though
yeah
it really is
really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price if you want to think of it that way
uh-huh
so when we get a $unc$twelve pack then thats $unc$twelve cents back
yeah
so you guys can actually get ahead
yeah
but they have sort of things that youre not reimbursed for or paid for
we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass and milk jugs and newspapers
yeah
everyone does newspapers
yeah
yeah
everybody does newspapers
but that kind of stuff
yeah
but they said they cant be smashed or else
it doesnt fit in their little containers
and theyre not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something
shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed $unc$pepsi cans and whatever up there
yeah
exactly
yeah
send it to this address
no
but lets see
they said that ways can encourage recycling
i tell you what really works at least down here is if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it
yeah
thats
in other words taking care of the environment is all well and good
uh-huh
but if its going to cost you to take care of the environment theyre not quite as likely to do it as if you get something back for it
as likely to do it
yeah
yeah
thats true
so if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer it kind of reminds me of using an a t m card to get money or doing your banking
uh-huh
yeah
if its free people will use it
if it costs them something then theyre not as likely to use it
yeah
exactly
you know
but i know we had a problem down here with people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer
uh-huh
yeah
and all that because there was
apparently a lot of people every time they change the oil
they just dump all their old oil down there
uh-huh
now theyre starting to recycle that stuff
thats good
another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
and $unc$one way that we do it sort of in $unc$iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
yeah
and that way you dont get near as much as you bought it for
but you got the use out of it
and what youre going to basically donate to a $unc$goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
yeah
and so thats something that ive never
yeah
were new to $unc$iowa
so thats something that i hadnt looked into before
but thats $unc$one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
yeah
i know a lot of places they
okay
okay
i guess were ready to start
i guess what part of the country do you live in
im in $unc$dallas $unc$texas
okay
what about yourself
im also in $unc$dallas
okay
the reason that i ask is the $unc$two conversations ive had have been out of state
uh-huh
but have you always lived here in $unc$dallas
and
no
ive lived here for almost $unc$five years now
i see
and im a
before that i was at school in $unc$rochester $unc$new $unc$york
and im originally from $unc$boston
you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
thats right
but i like it
you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow
i missed it at first
but now i go back there
and im a real wimp about the cold
so i like it here
yeah
its nice
thats good
i have lived in $unc$texas essentially all my life
uh-huh
around in $unc$texas
and i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it
uh-huh
but i dont know
im not sure i would want to take on those winters
im getting older and not sure thats something i want to do
i know
i live over in the $unc$lake $unc$highlands area if youre familiar with that
tell me where that is
okay
i probably do know
you
but i dont know it by that name
this is pretty well where $unc$l $unc$b $unc$j and $unc$audelia $unc$skillman cross
okay
sure
were just north of $unc$white $unc$rock $unc$lake
okay
yeah
i know that area
thats a nice area thats quite a range
we have some very nice homes here in this area
my particular
i guess they want us to describe the area
so my particular area the homes run anywhere from about $unc$sixty-five $unc$eighty $unc$thousand dollars on up to probably half a $unc$million
yes
the homes that were here earlier were smaller
now theyve gotten larger and larger as they have developed the land
and of course its pretty static right now
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
uh-huh
yeah
how about you
gosh im barely in $unc$dallas
im just north of $unc$addison $unc$airport up on the tollway
okay
okay
and i guess we have a similar situation
weve got houses $unc$two streets away that are probably around $unc$seventy $unc$eighty $unc$thousand
uh-huh
and then weve got $unc$bent $unc$tree right across the street
so i dont even know how high those go
okay
but some of those are pretty big
yes
those are over a $unc$million
yeah
so thats the strange thing about i guess $unc$dallas because back where im from you wouldnt have that sort of a variation at all
theyd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles
so
we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in $unc$dallas
yeah
not as bad as $unc$houston
but exactly what youre describing is what happens all over
uh-huh
yeah
ive noticed that
now do you live in a $unc$zero lot home
uh-huh
or
weve got a house
lets see
we moved in about $unc$four years ago
and it had previously been unoccupied
but it had existed for $unc$three years
okay
this is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them
and i guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away type of deal
so the whole block was all foreclosed
oh
and so some were vacant for quite a while before they finally sold them because there were so many
was your house in good shape
was it damaged
yes
no
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because theyd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open
it was
but
yeah
oh
so we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that
i see
and we havent had any problems
and we had originally thought wed have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldnt afford anything
but the prices are much lower here
and this was definitely not a fix up special
but ill tell you
it takes all my time
between we put in our own sprinkler system
and i just finished repainting the exterior and making drapes and buying furniture
its just a money pit really is
yes
i am familiar with that
where i live is a house thats $unc$seventeen years old when i bought it
and we bought it from someone who was in it
but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had sat empty for the better part of a year
uh-huh
and im not sure what happened
but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about $unc$four years
no
i found a lot of things
but
i say $unc$arlington $unc$texas now because i talked $unc$one night to somebody in $unc$arlington $unc$virginia
my
yeah
and $unc$plano $unc$texas rather than $unc$plano $unc$illinois
do they have $unc$one
yes
they do
i didnt know that
i learned something already
yeah
lets see
the $unc$three questions are what
how much time do you spend with your children
very little because theyre grown
oh
what
theyre grown and gone
yeah
mine is down at $unc$u $unc$t $unc$austin at college
and the other $unc$one is in high school
so you do spend less time then
yeah
c-
because they almost dont want to know us
they want to be with their friends
how old are your kids
are they married or what
yes
i have $unc$two married and then $unc$two almost married
and the other $unc$two im not sure
$unc$two for sure are single
you have a lot of kids
yeah
between the spouse and myself we have $unc$six
thats kind of nice though
you shouldnt be lonesome on a holiday
because i came with a split family
and she had
no
there is so much of them are gone
and theyre doing their own things
and a lot of times theyve got when the holidays
thats true
they have to see their other parent i guess too
yeah
and sometimes they want to do their own thing
so sometimes its just spouse and me
i know
and you know what
what
sometimes thats okay
i know
because
thats what my mother said $unc$one time
right
because who says that they just got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays
right
no
thats true
and if they force them to thats not good either
yeah
that becomes a drudgery
do they all live in the area
of the $unc$six weve got $unc$four around here
uh-huh
wow
were talking like north $unc$texas
uh-huh
and then $unc$one is in $unc$montpelier $unc$vermont
golly
and the other $unc$one is in $unc$everett $unc$washington
how did they end up so far away
thats my little pair and my second marriage
uh-huh
and
those are the youngest ones
yeah
the s-
the fourth and fifth child of the $unc$six are the $unc$two that are scattered like that
uh-huh
those are a long way
and they wanted to go
how
$unc$j $unc$r my middle son fell in love with $unc$washington state
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the third daughter fell in love with $unc$vermont
$unc$vermont
so
so they wanted to make their homes there
yeah
thats where theyve gone to make their homes
my goodness
are those $unc$two married
no
they just working up there or going to school or what
lets see
yeah
i guess youd say $unc$j $unc$r is working trying to go to school
uh-huh
i wish to $unc$god he would go back
they do especially if theyre meant to i think
yeah
i certainly hope so
ive got a daughter thats a sophomore at $unc$u $unc$t
and im going to $unc$u $unc$t $unc$a right now myself
so its never too late
uh-huh
i agree its never too late
right
and
especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about $unc$twenty percent older students
yeah
and when youre saying older were talking $unc$fifty up
yeah
ive seen some people that are really quite up there they look like in their very late sixties
uh-huh
and i say thats great why not
my
uh-huh
yes
why not because thats a lot of times its
i believe that we in that category
and im not in that category quite yet
no
but we are seasoned minds
yeah
youre really ready to learn finally
yes
uh-huh
i dont know why i even went to college when i was $unc$seventeen
yeah
it was
it was a complete waste of money
yeah
settle down
we know what were wanting to study
and we know our limitations
right
right
we
right
and
and we dont try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether
no
we dont go out drinking beer till $unc$three and try to go to class in the morning
at $unc$seven
yeah
were past that age
yes
were smarter now
we know what we can do
yeah
right
so lets see
so mine i dont spend a whole lot of time because theyre not here
uh-huh
and so forgot what the second question
what was it
what do the trends in families
and do we approve what other families do
the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing
thats right
but lately im seeing a change that government cant do it
a change
i was going to say the same thing
schools are not able to
uh-huh
uh-huh
and between a persons religion their faith in their maker whether youre christian or jewish or whatever
right
right
and the family
are going to have to solve some of the problem
those are the $unc$two that have the wherewithal
and of course $unc$judeo-christianity and of the jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the $unc$one that was given the mission by the lord to do this very thing
uh-huh
so when another group of people step in try to do it theyre tromping on our territory so to speak
so
oh
i firmly believe that
okay
you think youre getting your moneys worth
never
the only thing im thankful of is that we dont have to pay any income tax in $unc$texas
thats probably the next years agenda
yeah
boy i tell you what
i sure hope they dont pass something like that
yeah
theyre finding a way to tax you every time you turn around
and i think $unc$one way or the other were going to pay for the bureaucracy i guess
its $unc$one area that is really i think hurting the economy more than anything
i think every time you turn around they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products
and i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
i tell you
i remember every time it seems like we turned around theyre adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline
thats right
thats right
and that $unc$one the taxes on gasoline dont bug me as much as what are we $unc$eight and a quarter percent sales tax
yep
thats right
and every time you go to buy anything now
even they tax food
thats the $unc$one that really kind of bothers me
i think that the problem with the sales tax of course is its an unfair tax across the board as far as ability to pay which allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards
but now people with the lowest income pay a $unc$hundred percent almost of taxes on everything they buy and where people that make $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they arent going to be paying taxes on
and thats the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue
but i dont think it is anymore not in $unc$texas anyway
i got you because people that dont make very much money wind up spending it all
thats right
thats right
yeah
whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on
thats right
thats right
and thats the unfairness of the thing
but i think taxes generally are unfair
so
what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over or $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars
like other things if they dont affect you you dont worry about them too much
i have trouble buying a $unc$twenty $unc$thousand dollar car still
so it doesnt
i think generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is
sure
and i guess if people got $unc$thirty $unc$forty $unc$thousand bucks to spend on a car thats their prerogative
i dont have a whole of sympathy on that
maybe you buy that
and i dont mean to be knocking
no
no
i havent
but to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another $unc$ten percent tax on top of it
and theres an awful lot of cars that cost more than $unc$thirty $unc$thousand
yeah
there are
there are
and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess unless they really want it buy something that
more its just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids
its a way of increasing the population that was $unc$one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids on federal taxes
yeah
and where you exempt things like $unc$one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably $unc$lloyd $unc$bentsen said that if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be spending more money using their credit cards
right
right
i dont know if thats true or not
but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and any kind of interest that youre paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers
sure
so thats a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go tax things that they dont to a degree like booze
example they keep raising the taxes on booze
it gets to the point it makes drunks sober
they quit buying it
what about the taxes on cigarettes
tell me about your home
okay
right now were living in
its me my wife and $unc$two young boys
and right now were in i guess its either a $unc$zero lot line or a garden home which you might call it
uh-huh
so we dont have a big yard
but when my wife and i first moved in it was just the $unc$two of us
so it was enough
uh-huh
and its i guess what they call a story and a half
because its not a full $unc$two story where everything on top is on bottom
yeah
so its got real high ceilings on half the house
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
and its about a $unc$five year old house now
it sounds nice
its pretty nice
unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
yeah
yeah
it was a
$unc$landmark is the $unc$one who built it
yeah
these guys that gambled high lost big
yeah
thats true
and im insulating myself from that problem
exactly what happened to them
im building my own house
thats nice
and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation thats going up today
really
yeah
are you doing it yourself
yeah
wow
i used to be a builder
thats nice
and i retired about $unc$five years ago and started college
i see
and now im a college educated builder
theres still no work
yeah
so i decided this summer that we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
so i did
thats great
and see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
r-
is that so
i didnt know that
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you cant borrow the money to build your own
that sounds kind of dumb
its to protect the banks from guys that say i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
uh-huh
and then it doesnt sell
and then the banks holding the bag
yeah
yeah
as you know anything that involves the government works half as well as its supposed to costs $unc$three times as much right
thats right
hence the savings and loan problem we have
yeah
thats true
but my home is fairly simple
its designed to be added on to
uh-huh
thats good
yeah
i figure its just me and my wife
but i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot
so i want to have a shop
yeah
how big a lot do you got it on
$unc$ten acres
wow
thats nice
thats real nice
yeah
its really nice too because i cant see my nearest neighbor
hes on the other side of a hill
oh
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
seriously
god
thats pretty good
in the winter time i can see another guy
but i can just make out his place ive got a $unc$thirty mile view to the east and about $unc$ten miles to the north
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and
thats pretty good
yeah
i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning
uh-huh
you dont plan on putting any of that in
its got a very small furnace
uh-huh
and well use a wood burning stove as well
yeah
but in the house itself ive been working inside these many months
uh-huh
and i have not had to use the heat
wow
because its all geothermal
yeah
thats pretty good
and with all the
see ive got
on the south side is all glass
as much as i could get in it and the east side is glass
yeah
ive got $unc$one $unc$two $unc$three $unc$four $unc$five $unc$six windows in the east side on $unc$forty-eight feet
so its almost all glass
wow
and
my wife would love that
yeah
theres no place in the house where you can stand and not see $unc$four windows
she loves lots of windows
thats great
so
is it a single story
not really
its on the side of a hill
i see
so the first
the
what i call residential level at the side thats in the hill is about $unc$four feet deep
uh-huh
i see
and the side thats on the other side is about $unc$six feet high
oh
so ive got a pretty good grade there
yeah
and then when i put the verandas which will be $unc$twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
uh-huh
yeah
thats kind of like a victorian style
exactly
yeah
ive always liked that
the
we dont have much yard
but i built a small deck in the back
uh-huh
but i see these magazines where dig your own deck
uh-huh
i kind of wish i had them those size property and $unc$one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck
what sort of camping do you like to do the most
i do real rough type camping
i have a motor home
rough type
yeah
okay
yeah
motor homes can be a lot of fun
yeah
they really are
yeah
they really are
ive enjoyed it
ive never actually done any tent camping
that can be a lot of fun too
yeah
how about you
so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
uh-huh
this summer we went to the $unc$smokey $unc$mountain $unc$national $unc$park and stayed about $unc$three or $unc$four days in there
how great
it was wonderful
yeah
nights were cool enough to where theyre comfortable
and the days were nice and warm
and it was beautiful beautiful few days
uh-huh
thats great
it worked out particularly well especially considering she was $unc$six months pregnant
uh-huh
so i dont know
it worked pretty well
it was $unc$one of those dome type pop up tents
uh-huh
uh-huh
nice and quick and easy to put up
yeah
packs away nice and small
and about had to be something like that getting around in a $unc$pinto
thats true
thats true
it was a lot of fun
i guess the last real camping trip i took has been a couple years ago
yeah
i went to $unc$california up to the $unc$sequoias
wow
thats got to be beautiful territory
yeah
its gorgeous
i love the big trees
just the drive up the coast line and then cut over into the parks its gorgeous though
yeah
what like $unc$sequoia $unc$national $unc$park
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i had been there before when i lived in $unc$california
but thats my first trip back in goodness $unc$thirty years maybe
yeah
but that is gods country
it has to be
yeah
yeah
do they still have the scenic roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees
no
they dont
they
the last $unc$one
the first time i was there the tree was still standing
but it has since come down
okay
yeah
but they are huge
if youve never seen them its very awe inspiring
no
so far $unc$new $unc$orleans is far west as ive gotten $unc$new $unc$orleans and $unc$minneapolis
uh-huh
uh-huh
there is lots of pretty country further west
yeah
yeah
were hoping $unc$one of these days soon after were out of school to head that way
yeah
yeah
and you just need to take the little $unc$one show them all the pretties before they go away
yeah
yeah
yeah
they seem to be trailing out quickly
yeah
because there is lots to see
there is course the $unc$grand $unc$canyon
and the $unc$painted $unc$desert is real pretty in a different sort of way
yes
and course the $unc$sequoias and the $unc$redwoods and you get up into $unc$bryce $unc$canyon and $unc$yellowstone
and the $unc$grand $unc$tetons are gorgeous too
i imagine
yeah
i would imagine they are
course i guess im partial to big tree country
yeah
i dont know why i got stuck down here in $unc$texas now
i think its called a job
i dont know
not a whole lot of forestry down there is there
no
not around here
oh
not around here
place is forested with those concrete trees
uh-huh
lot of concrete and glass
yeah
i guess thats gods place too
anyway what do you figure has been the longest trip youve taken camping
yeah
probably the last $unc$one that i went to $unc$california
i took $unc$three weeks
$unc$three weeks
and i was actually on the road a little more than $unc$three weeks
yeah
the whole family then was in on this
uh-huh
everybody
yeah
yep
that would have to be a blast
yeah
it was great
what
you went out from $unc$texas up into that area
uh-huh
yeah
we took the southern route and went through the $unc$grand $unc$canyon again
and we stopped at $unc$las $unc$vegas for a couple of nights and then went into $unc$malibu in $unc$california over on the coast
yeah
and then we went up the $unc$big $unc$sur $unc$highway all the way up to $unc$san $unc$francisco and then cut across through the wine country and then went down to $unc$sequoia $unc$national $unc$park
okay
wow
okay
$unc$big $unc$sur $unc$highway thats where youre pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time arent you
yeah
okay
do you have any pets now
we dont right now
no
weve
i grew up with pets
my folks and i always had a dog and a cat some birds
yeah
but right now we dont have anything
okay
that
what about you
a matter of choice or compulsion
weve just
it seems like weve always been at a place where wed have to go away for the summer or something
and it was never convenient to have anything
yeah
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house
yeah
someplace where there
we can take care of it and everything
weve got some children who would just really enjoy having an animal a dog i think
yeah
and what about you all
yeah
right now im a student
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
no
no
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat
is that right
yeah
theyre very strict about it
but you like pets and things
i love animals
yeah
i was raised
our house when i was growing up there was almost never at least $unc$one cat in the house
uh-huh
it was almost always at least $unc$one cat sometimes like $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty but always cats in the house
yeah
we enjoyed them
oh
we like pets
but youve got to deal with taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that
yeah
and our kids are
weve got some children
and theyre not used to it on a daily basis
they
how old are your kids
from $unc$fourteen down to $unc$seven
okay
you sound like youve got some small ones in the background
$unc$one
is that right
our first
hes about $unc$eleven weeks now
great
yeah
congratulations
yeah
where are you from
originally
uh-huh
$unc$west $unc$virginia
okay
i dont know how familiar you are with that area of the country
but
ive been to $unc$charleston
$unc$charleston $unc$west $unc$virginia
yes
uh-huh
okay
thats pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway
uh-huh
okay
in the north end of the state youve got that little narrow strip of $unc$west $unc$virginia going up between $unc$ohio and $unc$pennsylvania
uh-huh
right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown
uh-huh
thats interesting
so its really up north in the country really
yeah
i guess so
yeah
its
my parents house is like $unc$three miles south of where the $unc$mason-dixon $unc$line would have hit the $unc$ohio $unc$river had it continued that far
gosh
i see
its pretty nice country up there
its beautiful
hills or what
from my neck of the woods its hilly
uh-huh
maybe $unc$four $unc$hundred feet elevation type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops
uh-huh
is it farmland
not a lot of farmland there
mostly its
theres individuals growing their own food
most of the agriculture its more in the way of sheep and cattle
yes
and even thats small time mostly
sure
the biggest chunk of whats going on there is industry
uh-huh
its coal mines and chemical plants and power plants
okay
aluminum plants
theres like $unc$two aluminum plants
what are you studying there at $unc$heidelberg
computer engineering
yeah
what year
just finished up my fourth semester
great
yeah
yeah
i hope that works out well
yeah
its a big change
yeah
i spent $unc$twenty years as a mechanic
whats
so
did you
yeah
youve got some experience behind you in the work force
yeah
yeah
are you shooting for a bachelors now or a masters or what
im working on a bachelors degree
okay
good
im working on a bachelors degree
itll be compu-
hope its a good program there
pardon
hope its a good program there
it seems to me from what ive been able to find out
yeah
good
thats considered a pretty good program
its nice and small which means if you dont get the class this semester then youve got to wait anywhere from $unc$two to $unc$four semesters to get it again
but its worth it once you get it
yes
thats good
and probably a good student teacher ratio and things
yeah
yeah
yeah
most the class are pretty small
good
that works out real well
i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment
or a house somewhere what would you get
first off wed probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy
uh-huh
im partial towards the larger dogs
uh-huh
our last weve had a couple of cats before we moved on campus
uh-huh
had a hamster or $unc$two
and they got to be a lot of fun
a hamster
yeah
its amazing how much character
okay
your family have reunions on a regular basis
probably once every $unc$five years
once every $unc$five years
uh-huh
yeah
you have got a pretty big family
yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over $unc$timbuktu
yeah
and you
yeah
we have a pretty big family
but most of us
i am originally from $unc$west $unc$virginia
uh-huh
most of the family is right in what they call tri-state area northern $unc$west $unc$virginia eastern $unc$ohio southwestern $unc$pennsylvania
yeah
most everybody is right in that area
that makes it a lot easier
a lot more convenient
that is why we only do it once every $unc$five or $unc$ten years
yeah
spec-
because it is always that hard to get everyone together
yeah
they put $unc$one together for our family about once every $unc$june
it was on my grandmothers birthday
but she is gone now
yeah
that is kind of what happened with ours
that is why we have not had $unc$one in a long time
yeah
so to make $unc$one successful what do you all do
oh
do you all just start planning real far ahead of time
pardon
do you all start planning real far ahead of time
no
there is kind of a set pattern to it
there is
so the day it happens is $unc$ninety-eight percent of the planning usually
really
yeah
we get together at the park and playground area of the church i was raised in
yeah
and everybody brings lots of food
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
eat a lot
gosh
it is a lot harder for us because like i said we are spread out
yeah
and so we have to plan really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can start their vacation time
schedule vacation time
and yeah
we usu-
$unc$sunday afternoon or sometimes it has been like on a $unc$saturday afternoon
uh-huh
usually it is like $unc$sunday afternoon
and most people do not have more than a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back
yeah
yeah
is that $unc$one of your
where i am calling from is southern $unc$mississippi
so my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most
but you also manage to make them
we have only made $unc$one of them since we got married about $unc$four years ago $unc$one of the family reunions
yeah
but we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough
yeah
they have been happening just after the summer semester starts
you cant really get away
usually not
we managed to get to $unc$one
that was before i started school
and she took that summer off
but
now that we have been talking about it i am kind of getting home sick now
because it has been over $unc$three years since i have been home to see my grandparents
goodness
my grandfather is the only $unc$one that is still around
yeah
and my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically
yeah
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of like
she was like the glue
so
yeah
i understand
where is home for you
originally i was born in $unc$missouri
yeah
but we have relatives scattered out all over $unc$louisiana $unc$mississippi here in $unc$texas
yeah
but it is harder for everyone to get home
yeah
maybe this year you can find a more central location
but the majority of them are just how you said in close quarters
so it is easier for us few stragglers to go home
okay
then the majority of them are still in the $unc$missouri area
yeah
okay
our family right now the most of it there is only a few stragglers with any distance
there is $unc$one cousin out in $unc$colorado some cousins over in $unc$phoenix
i got a sister over in $unc$washington $unc$state
the rest of them are within a couple hours drive
how do you all communicate like to plan it and every thing
do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it
or do you all like mail out stuff
that is pretty much it
yeah
it is going to be such and such weekend
and you all come
yeah
that is about it
and this is the standard pattern
it
everybody brings their favorite dish
and somebody brings the volleyball net
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon
and
i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had not seen in probably over $unc$ten years
it was like dont you remember me
and i am like no
am i related to you
yeah
i know
yeah
i married your cousins brothers uncle or something like that
do you have them every year
yeah
every year
and still you wind up meeting people you never knew you were related to let alone
yeah
and
i think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we dont have them that often
yeah
and then when we do and everyone finally does get together
it is like after the
okay
first i need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
of course its $unc$one of the last few things in the world youd ever want to do unless its just really for their own good
yes
yeah
id be very very careful checking them out
our
had t- place my mother in a nursing home
she had a rather massive stroke about $unc$eight months ago i guess
uh-huh
and i was fortunate in that
i was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown
yeah
so i was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it
but theres
i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while
that was really not a very good experience
it had to be done in a hurry
we didnt have $unc$six months to check all of these places out
and it was really not very good deal
yeah
we were not really happy with nursing home that we finally had
yeah
fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks
and she was able to return to her apartment again
but its really a big decision when to do it
yeah
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available
of course theres not $unc$one on every corner especially smaller areas smaller towns
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home
and she had used the walker for quite some time probably about $unc$six to $unc$nine months
and she had a fall
and finally she had parkinsons disease
oh
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
right
then she lived in an apartment
and that was even harder actually
uh-huh
uh-huh
because it was just a change of location
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
yes
she had children all across the $unc$united $unc$states
uh-huh
and she spent $unc$nine months out of the year just visiting her children
right
uh-huh
and that was pretty heart-rending for her
i can imagine
i think when she finally came to the realization that no i cannot take care of myself
uh-huh
thats tough
thats tough
yeah
for somebody who for most of their life has not just merely had a farm but had $unc$ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
uh-huh
uh-huh
and facing that situation its quite a dilemma
yes
i think
my mother
go ahead
yeah
my
probably $unc$one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have $unc$one child make that decision than just delegate it
uh-huh
i think that they had a great deal of
all the brothers and sisters got together
and they actually had a conference
thats great
and it was probably $unc$one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
thats right
and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them making that decision and then finding a place
right
yeah
and everybody had duties to perform
uh-huh
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making like finding a proper nursing home
uh-huh
yep
you were very fortunate
and they
i know
and they had seen it coming
uh-huh
so
it
i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
absolutely
unfortunately a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe $unc$one child in the whole family
yeah
yeah
we
and its usually not a very smooth thing
yeah
i was lucky too that i only have $unc$one brother
uh-huh
and fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done
my mother also was very independent
she still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age $unc$eighty-three
yeah
we were lucky in $unc$one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasnt really much aware of what was going on
uh-huh
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing
of course she would not have been happy there at all
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
yeah
yeah
with my grandmother i think it was such that she did not have the problem with
she was very well aware
and her daughter came and visited her
uh-huh
at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats great
and i think that when she passed away it was probably $unc$one of the greatest
i think it would be
it was more of a relief for her
uh-huh
sure
and
but she was truly aware
i dont know how i would deal if $unc$one of my parents came with alzheimers or something like that which is far more devastating
uh-huh
that would be tough
yes
absolutely
and i think that $unc$one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasnt necessarily like the quantity of care but the quality of care
uh-huh
yes
that the people that worked there were very interested to make it as close a home environment as possible
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
it would
i think for myself i see that as probably what everything would hinge upon
is it
how close is it to a home environment
yes
thats right
thats probably the major question
i think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly in a whole lot of areas
yeah
yeah
just people are of course populations getting older
yeah
its interesting that the population of the $unc$united $unc$states is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
uh-huh
matter of fact in the $unc$united $unc$states we used to have extended families
uh-huh
it wasnt
true
but i guess as we become more industrialized and less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel its kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
sure
absolutely
and things are scattered so much nowadays
yeah
i think that perhaps the extended family it maybe $unc$one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
yes
of course there comes other issues whether we feel like theyre going to be a good caretaker for our children
yes
but
just because theyre grandparents
they raised us after all
yeah
just because theyre grandparents that doesnt automatically make them a good child carer
yeah
but i think that ive had a lot of good experiences with many people especially where theyve had extended family
and i kind of see that perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment and get down to the values of
uh-huh
its
money seems to be too big of an issue with whats going on today
yeah
sure
realistically it is
and i think that may be perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
uh-huh
that would certainly help
we may not have as high a standard of living
uh-huh
but actually have a truer standard of living
right
thats just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think your right
okay
i guess that was it
okay
it was good talking to you
okay
yeah
all right
take care
hey
bye-bye
bye-bye
the first thing for me is i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is if an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state
thats $unc$one thing
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you thats another
and the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country
but in the second time at least overtly where someone comes in and finds out information about you that should be private does not seem obviously everyday
i think i agree with that
i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens when the phone rang
and its $unc$t $unc$i calling
my immediate reaction is that its some sort of strange phone message
and then i realize this is something i solicited
thats right
so my immediate reaction was $unc$one of that sense of invasion
but after that i realized i really wanted this
and it was sort of exciting
and so that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
uh-huh
right
it turned out to be an invitation
exactly
and at the same time i think that i receive on the order of probably $unc$seven or $unc$eight a week calls of the nature where $unc$one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
from personal parties or from these phone commercial things
commercial solicitations primarily
thats a remarkable number
i get them rarely
and im still astounded that $unc$one they let anyone do them and $unc$two that they have any effect in this whatsoever
because im usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are
yeah
i think they prey on peoples inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine
i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though theres not even a person there
and i think thats what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
and ones feeling obligated because of some sense of the way the ritual is played out
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that then ends up being the most common example for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess im not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised
yeah
and i dont think i would have thought about that
i think thats a good idea on your part
i dont typically feel intruded on the sense of finding out information
presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer not to be known
and the classic i dont know $unc$c $unc$i a conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge
so theres things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it
and i cant talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia
its a surmise
and id like to think that its quite low at least in this country
to surmise it is there
i dont think like the $unc$k $unc$g $unc$b monitoring my phone or anything like that
i guess although thats a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because if thats the case of a tree falling in the forest
uh-huh
yeah
and im not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasnt been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
uh-huh
if your defining it in terms of information gone even if its something you dont know about it then i guess one could assume one was invaded
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i dont feel invaded by it
uh-huh
i dont have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things
uh-huh
im not sure why
i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
and if someone finds out something about me that is true i dont have a sense of loss from that
uh-huh
you must have a relatively clean conscience then
the other side of that might be if someone found out something or surmised something that werent true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
yes
yes
more harmed or something
bec-
right
because you dont have anyway to turn it off
yeah
tho-
did you hear about this $unc$lotus data base that was being put together
yes
i did
i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there be a good possibly that their facts were fantasy
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that i would rather they didnt
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance that i would have thought to be private
uh-huh uh-huh
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things thats even worse
or if my call rate of $unc$eight or so a week went up even higher because someone had
uh-huh
uh-huh
they had you pegged
right
and the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money
and then all of a sudden you get your $unc$thirty a week because now theyre advertising you
yeah
yeah
right
exactly
yeah
and $unc$one of the problems with the $unc$lotus data base was that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information
they said they would give it out to only select companies
but just like software is only given out to customers
you cant believe that
right
right
it would be pirated
and they wouldnt bother to check that carefully anyway to someone whos offering full cash price for it
right
you cant tell it what a company really has to do with it
and theres something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are
and that hacker just has to get in touch with the sneak thief
and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home
uh-huh
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not youre feeling threatened as a result of it
yeah
so maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is
yes
exactly
uh-huh
i also thought about it waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isnt
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy
if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someones going to invade my privacy very quickly
uh-huh
and i realize that i can take that for granted
but i used to live in $unc$india
and things are quite different there in terms of that
theres less of a sense of privacy
in fact its said that no indian language has a word for privacy
certainly the language i know doesnt but just says a word for loneliness
thats interesting
loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
but no concept for wanting to be private
yeah
its generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially
okay
so theres not
doors dont have latches on them
people dont tend to knock
you just
if theres a door closed and you open it because its in your way
people walk in out
and as a westerner in $unc$india i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
oh
that would be culturally shocking
it very much is
but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
uh-huh
and people would leave me alone
uh-huh
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you violate the norms of public behavior
people start paying attention to you very much
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are quote unquote you asked for it
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
yes
which isnt always the case in all cultures
and it wasnt until i was thinking about it just now that i realized thats actually something thats culturally relative
that is true
i havent thought about that
and that its fascinating to think a lot of someone who doesnt know how to say private
uh-huh
uh-huh
and thats really
i wonder how people have sex and things like that
you go to $unc$india
and the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra $unc$hundred $unc$million every few years
but i just dont quite
theres hope i actually for al-
of the time ive spent there i still dont quite understand how certain things that i assume require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
yes
because anyone can be alone for some period of time
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that theres this invisible barrier around me which people will respect
yes
and if thats gone i really dont know how to live very well
and i really do wonder how people do that
thats interesting
are there any other specific things where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency
all the other classic examples the jehovahs $unc$witness or $unc$mormons or someone knocking at the front door which is more intrusive because i have to really tell someone to go away
and theres that sense of i have now opened my door they now see what i look like what i live like
and theyre doing something that normally i really only invite people to
okay
because anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me
but no one is just welcome to come by my house
so that is more of a sense of invasion
so thats another example of the invasion because of the not so
hi $unc$diana
hi
have you all been able to do much as a family these days
pardon me
have you all been able to do much as a full family these days all of you
yes
weve gone all kinds of places
we go out to dinner
yeah
we take the kids to the park
and whenever my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo
or we do everything we can possibly as a family
do you work outside the home
no
i dont
yeah
i dont either
it makes it a little bit easier i think that way
yeah
it does
an then my husband enjoys spending time with the kids
hell take them out just to be with them
yeah
so they can have time with him right
so you have a break too
and we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home we try to spend $unc$monday nights we call it family home evening and have little lessons with them and just see how things are going in our family and teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
uh-huh
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that
an
yeah
we have family thats far away
it sounds like you might too
yeah
we do
so the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures
yeah
and
right
and phone calls thats about it
yeah
right
and we go to the park
or we go in the backyard and sit down
an
thats what we mostly do pretty simple things
yeah
especially since my youngest one is only $unc$fourteen months
right
shes really getting to the age where shes playing and likes to go places
uh-huh
yeah
and with me being at home and just having the $unc$one income you dont have this lot of extra money to do a lot of extra things
thats right
so you make more fun than
the kids just think its wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or or go get a bag of $unc$m and ms or something like that
thats a big thrill for them
they think thats a lot of fun
so we try to spend as much time as we can
we
our whole weekends are devoted to our children except for we might go out $unc$one evening or something
yeah
but during the day its all devoted to our kids
and they go to church with us
and so
yeah
thats true
yeah
so
have you ever been to its called the $unc$science $unc$place
yes
yes
thats what
we havent lived here too long
and we went there a couple of weeks ago
and
uh-huh
the kids thought that was wonderful
yeah
we
i guess theres $unc$science $unc$place $unc$one and $unc$science $unc$place $unc$two
weve only been in i think its $unc$science $unc$place $unc$two
im not sure which one we went into
it was about a year or so ago when we went
the one we went in had
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a kids place area
uh-huh
yeah
they really seemed to go wild in there
yeah
yeah
they had a lot of fun in there
and theres some petting like
i think its $unc$owens $unc$country $unc$farms has a free petting like a farm that you can go to
and the kids can pet animals and stuff
wheres that
thats on $unc$plano $unc$road
its like in $unc$richardson you go up $unc$plano $unc$road
its a little bit past $unc$campbell and $unc$plano $unc$road
uh-huh
uh-huh
and thats a lot of fun
yeah
they have tours going through there
and the kids think that was a lot of fun too
that does sound like fun
its a little bit of a ways
whenever we take them to $unc$showbiz
or they think its wonderful just to go to mcdonalds
they dont go for the food
they go to play around
and theres another place in $unc$mesquite called $unc$monkey $unc$business
thats right
uh-huh
and its a indoor fun park
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids
thats sounds fun too
and parents get in free
and during the week
its $unc$five dollars admission per child all day
and you said about $unc$plano and $unc$campbell is the petting
the petting farm
yeah
that sounds fun
i think maybe well try to do that
yeah
yeah
and the $unc$one in $unc$mesquite is $unc$scyene exit
uh-huh
and its
the kids just had a wonderful time there
you just pay that admission
and then all the rides are free
of course they have all the little video games and those little quarter rides and stuff like that
but they thought that was lot of fun
yeah
you can have birthday parties there
an i think that was better than $unc$showbiz $unc$pizza cause theres more for them to do
because they can just do
you dont have to have tokens for everything
yeah
right
yeah
so they had a lot of fun
that does sound like fun
ive gotten some good ideas from you
yeah
we try to do a lot of things as a family and inexpensively as possible
so
definitely
i think i dont know if weve done $unc$five minutes
but im sure that will be good
yeah
that will be good
yeah
it was good talking to you
it was good talking to you
i really appreciate your suggestions
no problem
take care
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
with credit cards i try to get maybe just $unc$one or $unc$two
i dont like having credit cards for every store
i just dont like them
what are you afraid of with them
what am i afraid of
yes
i dont know if im really afraid of spending too much
i just dont think that i need them
i
they are tempting at times
but sometimes i just dont like everybody knowing everything about me
so
thats can be very very true
and everybody just gives you a credit card just so youll spend money
so
thats the idea
they figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
yeah
uh-huh
and
thats right
they make money off of it whether you use it or not
absolutely
the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest
thats right
uh-huh
i use mine a great deal for groceries for everything that i can and then just write $unc$one check at the end of the month for the entire thing
uh-huh
thats what i do
right
thats what i do
just a second
sorry
thats all right
sounds like you have a little one there
i have $unc$two little ones
yes
you have
yeah
tha-
great
how old are they
$unc$four and $unc$two and half
boy those are $unc$two very active ages
yes
so yeah
im like you
i only use my credit card for when i
i just use it whenever i feel like i dont want to write a check
but i dont charge anything that i cant payoff at the end of the month
uh-huh
do you ever use the a t m machines
no
i never do
my husband does at work just to get cash out
but i take the checkbook
so if i need cash i just tell him
and he gets it out
and i dont even think i know my number
i find it a great use from the standpoint that you dont have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
uh-huh
thats right
he couldnt do without it since he can just do it right there at work for nothing
that helps
right
yeah
the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their credit card like their $unc$visa or their $unc$mastercard for cash
uh-huh
and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
youre right
and thats kind of silly
yeah right
absolutely
yeah
because they figure that thats correct
youre defeating the purpose
the idea is to use their money
yeah
and during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month
yeah
yeah
i get at least $unc$one or $unc$two a week people sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone i just say i dont want it
uh-huh
right
because i
i think thats the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted
yeah
its like id like to know where they determine that im such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line
i-
youve already been preapproved
absolutely
preapproved
thats their favorite word
yes
everybody in the country is preapproved i think
i think so youre right
its interesting that people have generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that $unc$one day they find wow i didnt realize id spent this much money
that much stuff
right
and then they cant meet the minimum monthly payments on it
and some people use $unc$one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
uh-huh
and that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
yeah
it does because youre just costing yourself more money because if you cant make the monthly minimum payment youre paying interest again
thats right
so
thats right
yeah
so
its been enjoyable talking with you
yeah
its enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way
so
right
take good care
take care of your little ones
you too
good luck
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
here goes $unc$sharon
okay
what do you think about $unc$nolan $unc$ryan being the first baseball player to earn a $unc$million dollars
thats the only thing i found out tonight
you found that out tonight
yeah
i havent even heard that
thats great
i think he deserves every penny of it
yeah
but there are some others out there that i dont believe deserve the money theyre getting
isnt it funny how baseballs getting less than football players would
yeah
wonder because football
and they play a lot longer season too
and a lot more games right
yeah
thats exactly right
uh-huh
but i think lets see
the teams that were there last year were somebody from $unc$california
i dont even know who won the pennant last year
beats me
i know $unc$yankees have won a lot games through the years
yeah
not lately though
we have been talking about this
i tried to call earlier
uh-huh
and we had made a list of all these baseball teams and the cities that they were from
then i started cleaning
and i dont even know where i even put that paper
threw it away
yeah
i was just cleaning and throwing
gosh
lets see
the teams that
i think the as were in it last year
the $unc$oakland as and i dont think it was an all $unc$california baseball
have you ever played baseball
i played softball
thats what i did when i was growing up
yeah
that was fun
yeah
thats fun
thats a whole different sport
uh-huh
yeah
lets see
but i think the $unc$rangers need to go
and i think the $unc$pirates will go
and lets see
$unc$rangers have got a new guy this year
i dont even remember his name either
do you ever go see the $unc$rangers
every once in a while i like to go on the nights when theres not very many people out there
its a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd
yeah
i think its fun
i like just looking at the billboards
yeah
b-
sometimes if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
yeah
its nice at night
yeah
thats when ive been
it is
and do you know anything about that new stadium
have you seen all those pictures that theyre going to put out there
no
yeah
that huge
its suppose to be a huge stadium
and its going to have little shopping centers in it and like a lake or something running through it
and theyre going to try to make it a real community center out there
cou-
and you re going to be able to buy your
what was wait about the liquor
thats in $unc$texas stadium where the football players play
yeah
so you
and theyre never going to let liquor in there
theyre trying
i know
but they try every year
and every year they get thrown out
its so stupid because they let you take it in there
but dont allow them to sell it there
uh-huh
but that new stadiums going to be real nice
and i heard that you can bid on that stadium
last night on the news i heard that they said you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
so
uh-huh
right
and its going to go to the highest bidder
thats the way to do it
yeah
so that could be your $unc$fifteen minutes of fame
you hear that
thats my kids turning on their music
oh
$unc$holly turn it down
i think its the $unc$bart man the $unc$simpsons
god i stay away from them
i wish i could
i bet you do
where are you
in $unc$plano
okay
im in $unc$garland
you are
yeah
my husband teaches in $unc$plano
whats he teach
$unc$c $unc$v $unc$a $unc$e
uh-huh
what do you do
i teach
but i teach for $unc$dallas
you do
for right now
im trying to get out
is that a tough system to be in
uh-huh
real hard
uh-huh
yeah
i would think it
its good because they try new things
but its like theyll try something
and then they throw it out and get something else
yeah
and you get tired of that
thats typical bureaucracy though
i think its going to be any where you go
its just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones
yeah
i dont know
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad
but they cant be though
they dont have as much money
yeah
most of the time
but the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
in $unc$dallas you dont even know whos in administration
theres so many of them
you dont even know who to payoff
somebody walks in a classroom
and you dont know what theyre there for when theyre coming how long theyre going to be
yeah
how funny
its just there they are
and theyre writing the whole time
no communication whatsoever
no
i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything
and i finally just got to where i go okay im $unc$debbie $unc$moore may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for
yeah
because you never know where they are going what theyll report
or
i know
and theyll tell you theyve written something down
and you hope theyre telling you the truth
and you never see it
no
huh-uh
thats got to be frustrating
it is
how long you taught in $unc$dallas schools
this is my eleventh year
thats about $unc$ten too many
no
actually its
now my jobs good much better than a lot because im $unc$chapter $unc$one
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and all i do is teach reading all day long
oh
and its just $unc$ten children at a time
thats not bad
no
its good
and youve got a lot of federal money too
but hasnt it changed a lot over the years
teaching
yeah
yes
or working in the system
yes
when i first started teaching i remember i went to my
and i said i want to see a curriculum guide
so ill know what im suppose to teach
and they go we dont have one
we dont even know where one is
god
and so i go okay you just did what you wanted to do
how funny
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and what day what period
yeah
you dont know which is worse
yeah
no
i know which is worse
yeah
i guess so
yeah
being told what to do is worse
uh-huh
how long are we suppose to talk for
you can talk for $unc$ten minutes
but you dont have to
you can
yeah
and no
if you talk to $unc$ten then they come on and say youve extended your limit
and please say good-bye within the next $unc$five seconds
i havent ever talked that long
i hadnt either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from $unc$cleveland $unc$ohio
uh-huh
and we started talking about gangs
he lives in $unc$cleveland
yeah
wow
and everybody else that ive talked to has been right around here
yeah
but she was real interesting
and then tonight this woman called
have you taken any incoming calls
yours is my second one
okay
so hers was the first $unc$one i gotten
and she was telling me all her problems
and it went over $unc$ten minutes
did you all not talk about the topic at all
yeah
we did
but the topic was boring i thought
oh
what would you serve if you were having a dinner party
gosh all the other
the $unc$one i talked about the other night was good
it was about movies what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
yeah
i could go on and on about that
me too because we go all the time
the guy i was talking to never goes
he was boy it sounds like your really up on this
i said i see at least $unc$two a week
neat
so that was real good to talk about that
have you seen silence of the lambs
no
youve got to go see that
the last one i saw was dances with wolves
yeah
we talked about that one too
and he said he didnt think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long
but i
i enjoyed it
i did too
it was just more for my money
yeah
i didnt think it was too long at all
he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
the other one you need to go see is sleeping with the enemy
uh-huh
and how old are your kids
$unc$one is $unc$eight
and $unc$one is $unc$eleven
you probably dont want to take them to see silence of the lambs
its not too cool for kids
they usually pick their own
i bet they do
theyve got it all figured out
yeah
they want to see all the horror movies
and $unc$ninja $unc$turtles
yeah
$unc$ninja $unc$turtles got to have those
but most of the time really we watch them on the video
yeah
you brin-
thats
dont you
just massive rental
heck thats a lot cheaper then taking them out to the show
going to
i know
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you dont have to watch them all in $unc$one time
thats what we do especially when its bad weather man just plug it in
yeah
of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent
i know
its good when you go to $unc$tom $unc$thumb though
and theyre cheap
and nobody has got them yet
thats true
unbelievable
thats true
we saw heroes have always been cowboys tonight
uh-huh
it was okay
it was kind of slow
and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end
it
i dont know
$unc$one of those movies its not going to be around long
it will be a dollar movie in no time
do you read
not very much
no
no
i dont have the patience to read
i do that to make myself go to sleep at night
yeah
my $unc$mom and $unc$dad read all the time
you saw field of dreams right a long time ago
yeah
sure did
i was reading the book
and its called shoeless $unc$joe
really
it was so wonderful
and then i decided i like this author
so i got a book of his short stories
and thats been real good
who is the author
dont ask me
oh
the ghost of shoeless $unc$joe was the name of the book
$unc$shoeless $unc$joe
was it like the movie
yes
okay
quite a bit
but in the movie the guy was black
right
he wasnt in the book
thats $unc$one difference
there really wasnt a lot of difference
i didnt
i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
thats interesting
that was a good movie too
do you think we covered baseball
i think so
okay
have a good night
okay
whos your favorite team
who do you think
the $unc$dallas $unc$cowboys
the $unc$dallas $unc$cowgirls
yeah
they did have a fairly decent year finally this year
uh-huh
at least theyre coming around
yeah
theyre going to get better
i think once $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson gets his system established theyll do all right
yeah
as long as $unc$troy $unc$aikman doesnt get hurt again
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year
uh-huh
i dont even know who your favorite team is
im a $unc$viking fan
okay
i think i did know that i just forgot
okay
and they havent been doing too hot
so
yeah
has $unc$herschel $unc$walker done much for them
no
in fact the $unc$cowboys got the best end of that deal
definitely
he was a good player i guess
i dont know
he just never
i dont know
for a while there
ive never been over impressed with him
hed get past $unc$six or $unc$seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone
but i guess you never could really see him play because with the $unc$cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor
so you couldnt really tell if it was just him or the team
and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team
but i dont know
whos the running
is it $unc$sammy $unc$smith
or is it $unc$emmett $unc$smith
$unc$emmett $unc$smith
yeah
$unc$emmett $unc$smith
n-
hes been doing real good
im pretty impressed with him so far
yeah
did he actually play in the $unc$pro $unc$bowl
i remember he was a backup
and then somebody got injured
and he was supposed to go
im not sure
yeah
i havent been keeping up with football in the fall
i can go on and on about football
but since its kind of off season its kind of hard to think back about all that
but
who else is
theres $unc$mike
$unc$minnesota $unc$vikings used to be the general manager starting the $unc$world $unc$football $unc$league
yeah
and he was trying to keep
i cant even think of the guys name either the coach of the $unc$vikings
i have no idea
bu-
$unc$jerry $unc$burns
no earthly idea
he was going to keep him as the coach somehow
but i dont know
id like to see the $unc$vikings get revamped somehow
how did they end up this year
did they make it to the play-offs at all
they started out really bad
they went $unc$one and $unc$six
and then they won $unc$five or $unc$six in a row
uh-huh
so they were in a shot to make the play-offs
and they screwed up the last couple of games
kind of like the cowboys
yeah
i guess you can
except i think the $unc$cowboys are on the upswing
i dont know about the $unc$vikings
yeah
just hadnt heard much about them lately
and the $unc$cardinals were kind of like the $unc$cowb-
in fact they were doing better than the $unc$cowboys
and the $unc$cowboys came on strong at the end of the season
and the $unc$cardinals got killed by the $unc$cowboys
so
yeah
the $unc$cardinals i dont know
i think the $unc$cowboys probably have a better team
they just
at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with $unc$aikman getting hurt because $unc$laufenberg just couldnt ever really get it together at all
of course he sat along the sidelines all season
he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
dont made any excuses for him
im just saying i shouldnt blast him like that say $unc$laufenberg got out there and blew it for them
he didnt get to see much action but too bad
because now he had a shot and didnt look too good
and so no ones going to have much faith in him any more
uh-huh
in fact i think theyre getting a different guy for a backup quarterback
i havent kept up with it lately
but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody
but it wasnt anybody id really heard of
but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that aikmans back in practicing doing real real well
who is it $unc$michael $unc$irvin
uh-huh
he said that $unc$aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time
so sounds like hes going to be all right for next season
theyre just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder back in shap-
it was his shoulder wasnt it that he had the problems with
i dont know
yeah
i think it was
i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on
but anyway theyre trying to keep him from reinjuring anything but anyway
but i got my $unc$thirty day notice yesterday
$unc$thirty day notice for what
im done where i work
really
anyway i guess we cant talk much more about that
but i just thought id throw that in there
what
okay
maybe ill call you back after the recording is finished
i think we have talked about football for $unc$five minutes
i cant remember
w-
ive always ran out of time ever since ive done this
really
i usually have too
they always say youve talked your $unc$ten minute limit
yeah
ive done that once or twice
i didnt look at the clock when we started talking
so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got $unc$five minutes in
make sure we get our cash flow
yeah
other than the $unc$vikings who do you like
when i was younger i was a $unc$cardinal fan too
oh
remember $unc$jim $unc$hart
$unc$jim $unc$hart was playing
$unc$terry $unc$metcalf was on the $unc$cardinals
this was a long time ago
yeah
i dont know who else ive ever
thats about it
i was always a $unc$viking fan
i think i was into the $unc$cardinals for a little bit
and
uh-huh
back when they were in $unc$saint $unc$louis
yes
of course
since theyve been to $unc$phoenix they havent been all that impressive i guess
i guess ive always been a $unc$cowboy fan
other than that when you grow up in a city that has $unc$one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it
yeah
the $unc$cowboys were americas football team
yeah
theres no question about that
so
yeah
it was really exciting growing up when the $unc$cowboys were really big
because my parents would always have season tickets
and theyd go to all the games
and the hype were just unbelievable
its just the last
i guess probably since about $unc$eighty-four about $unc$eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really
but im just used to always growing up and hearing $unc$cowboys $unc$cowboys $unc$cowboys and $unc$super $unc$bowl and all this other stuff
so i cant
im not going to decide i dont like them just because theyre having a few bad years
i think theyll pull out of it
and theyll wind up being good again
theyve got lot of really good young players that are going to do pretty good i think
but theyre raising prices on their tickets
so theyre banking on doing good next season
i think tickets are
again
yeah
what are they going up to $unc$thirty bucks or something
$unc$thirty or $unc$thirty-two for really good tickets
they sectioned it out even more
they used to just have
first of all it was all $unc$one price
and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else
and now theyre sectioning it off from $unc$one $unc$twenty yard line to the other $unc$one
just on the lower levels is the highest price
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level
and then from the $unc$twenty to the $unc$ten yard line
and then theyre some sections kind of in the corner areas
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones
but they have about $unc$four or $unc$five different prices now
that theyre structuring it with
but obviously theyre all going up more or less is what its going to do
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year
im not sure
im not positive
i didnt really think about that
i just remember trying to figure out where you could get
that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper
but not that ill ever go
i hadnt been to a $unc$cowboys game
last time i went to the $unc$cowboys game was during that $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l strike or when they had the scab teams in there
and it was the $unc$dallas and $unc$washington $unc$redskins game
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets
and if theyre not going to use them theyll give them to somebody else
so i went with my dad to a game that $unc$one time
but that wasnt a real
it was the scab teams
it was kind of different i guess
and before that its been quite a few years
ive been wanting to go to a game
i just never have gotten around to it
so maybe this year
thats interesting
i almost lost our electricity here
oh
okay
what do you do this weekend
pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
which is
what do you have planned for your yard
we just bought our house last $unc$july
and the house is $unc$forty years old
so theres an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that
but theyve gone a few years of neglect
uh-huh
so were in the process of revitalizing the whole situation
weve got different flower beds in front and a built in window box trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
what part of the state do you live in
i live in $unc$dallas
okay
okay
my wife and i we live in $unc$dallas too
so
okay
yeah
just what that area
were planning on moving to $unc$flower $unc$mound
and were going to be getting some wheel h-
were going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there
yeah
seems like it
the place weve been living at were just leasing it
in $unc$plano the soil has such a high clay content that i went to use my dad-in-laws tiller and it about for my arms off sockets
uh-huh
ill bet
ill bet
just scratching $unc$two or $unc$three inches was just a chore
it was
and then when it gets wet you dont even want to get out in the yard
right
its horrible
right
its a nightmare
but i dont know where you live is there a real high alkaline or ash content
or
yeah
its pretty high alk- w-
its done
its in the north end of $unc$oak $unc$cliff in $unc$kessler $unc$park area
yeah
yeah
and weve got about
i know right where thats at
yeah
weve got maybe $unc$eight inches to a foot of soil
uh-huh
and then its solid rock from then on down
so
really
yeah
its a little aggravating
we cant put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because theyve got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock
golly
but
is it limestone underneath
yeah
it is
its solid limestone
how do you put trees in there
were just happy that theres trees already there so far
anything like that is a major undertaking i guess
sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because theres an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
but
and it not even considering a pool or anything like that practically has to be blasted in i guess
oh
but
and it makes for a different challenge
ive never
i moved to $unc$dallas about $unc$five years ago
yeah
and i never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now
but i keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town
in fact we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
uh-huh
and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said ive got a dozen different varieties
and each $unc$one works in $unc$one part of town
and thats it
thats basically what he was trying to tell us
yeah
yeah
we tried planting tomatoes last year
and they turned out pretty poor
yeah
i just wish id known the variety and everything
yeah
it
but its amazing we also have roses
and they just grow so beautifully
yeah
that wou-
in fact we put in some more roses yesterday
what type roses
a few different hybrid tea type varieties
hybrid teas
yeah
yeah
we have a few of the real short stem
theyre kind of like the bush roses
okay
but i dont know i think it only has about $unc$five or $unc$six more years to go because its a really old bush
yeah
but im amazed because the sun is so intense
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
yeah
thats what were searching
weve got all the different lake editions around the house
and were kind of experimenting right now
uh-huh
weve got the direct sun in front
and the backyard has $unc$two great big spruce and an oak tree all about $unc$forty to $unc$fifty foot tall
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
and were struggling to find something for those areas
yeah
have you done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not
no
theyre in pretty good condition
yeah
weve been pretty lucky on that
yeah
just if you want a lot of light for underneath that may be all right we have some old fruit trees
uh-huh
we have a plum thats just about ready to go
uh-huh
so we may just be getting rid of that
but our peaches they seem to be doing just fine
but they really need pruning
yeah
it just seems that even pruning once a year is really not enough
but the way they behave
thats true
thats true
i dont know
but what kind of grass are you growing
its $unc$bermuda
$unc$bermuda
yeah
yeah
ive been trying a mixture of the $unc$bermuda and the rye
okay
but i may be working like a fescue in because of the type of weather
it seems that bermudas fine
but it looks like it would hold the soil
but it really doesnt
right
a lot of silt that comes in it just doesnt seem to hold it very well
yeah
but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
okay
but once it gets over $unc$seventy $unc$seventy-five degrees it just dries up shrivels up and dies
uh-huh
but anyway
yeah
its
theres such a difference through the year
yeah
my parents-in-law theyre building a house into the side of a hill
its already been built and everything
uh-huh
theyve been living there for about $unc$three months now
but this is out in west $unc$texas
uh-huh
but the wind there has been so bad that theyve tried to plant grass
and they just have some big time problems
thats it
so they just watching their lawn just blow away
yeah
but its quite an undertaking
they have about $unc$two or $unc$three acres of land on lake front property on the side of a hill
wow
its beautiful
you can see the house from miles away
uh-huh
but its a pretty neat little job
but they save a lot of energy
yeah
but just for them theyre going to have to start gardening
its going to be from the ground up
yeah
the whole way
yeah
and they said we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
its amazing
all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods
yeah
yeah
and its all on $unc$lake $unc$greenbelt that property out there
okay
and i dont know what they have
they have all the water they want
uh-huh
they can pump water
they have to get permission
but they can pump water up from the shore
okay
but thats for an additional
they have to pay some kind of fee per year
okay
but right now though i think theyre trying to get the trees planted and everything
sure
but i just think of all of the money that theyre going to have to spend just getting that
but the taxes alone there $unc$lake $unc$greenbelt
and some places they really nail them for tax
uh-huh
and your talking what just several $unc$hundred dollars a year in property taxes
wow
its ridiculous
that really is
it would
it seem like it be just the opposite when you get
yeah
no
no
its
because even though its far out there its just that $unc$lake $unc$greenbelt they try to do it just from selling the water
uh-huh
but the water usage they try to limit even though theres $unc$three or $unc$four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in towns like $unc$clarendon and other areas where they irrigate
uh-huh
they still havent gotten used to the dry land farming
but the irrigation because its gotten so bad the past few years
yeah
thats true that
but i dont know
i just came back from there
and just the air is so dry
i dont see how anything can survive out there for long periods of time
should say
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees theyre pretty smart
theyre smart
theyre about the smartest tree around
they dont even start growing until $unc$may or $unc$april after its been raining for a few months
yeah
thats true
thats true
they say the roots have developed
so thats all they work on
just a leafy
they dont do anything
uh-huh
yeah
thats something ive been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year
uh-huh
and were trying to decide what to put on $unc$one side of the house and things like that
but theres so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks
then its just a bush there from then on
its kind of disappointing
i dont know
my wife and i on the south side of our house we planted some gardenias
uh-huh
and they did real fine during the summertime
its just
but during the fall when the rain let off just a little bit it just dried up
yeah
so i guess these plants they dont
its like they remain
how do you feel about the immigration laws
at
currently i think they are a little restrictive particularly for certain ethnic groups or from certain countries
i think we should permit more immigration from eastern $unc$europe for example particularly the $unc$jewish people from $unc$russia
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years
and i think we have too much restriction on the $unc$orientals also
but of course thats just my opinion
yeah
im not real sure why i got this topic because i dont think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws
uh-huh
uh-huh
we seem to favor certain countries particularly south american countries
and there is no
i have nothing of course against the $unc$south $unc$americans or $unc$hispanics in that sense
but i think we are more restrictive of the so called eastern european countries than we should be
of course thats from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern $unc$europe
so
oh
so i think the embargo we placed on the russian $unc$jews although we spent years and years lobbying for their release and their ability to immigrate from $unc$russia as soon as that occurred we simply said that instead of the $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by $unc$two thirds
uh-huh
so
i do not quite go along with that
but
no
that doesnt make a whole of lot sense
no
and i still think
again kind of having within this century come from an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides
uh-huh
both my mothers parents and my fathers parents were immigrants
so im a little touchy every now and then about that
yeah
my family is from $unc$europe from $unc$england and $unc$ireland and have been in this country for more than a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty years almost $unc$two $unc$hundred years
uh-huh
my
so i dont have any relatives several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family
they were all born here
uh-huh
so i dont have any real strong ties with the immigration laws
i dont have any personal feelings about them
and i havent taken the time or effort to learn what they are
i think in a way though i also have an opposite point of view which is although i believe we should permit constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons i think we should have some quotas
of course my family and i
again that was
my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas
so they had to wait in certain parts of $unc$europe for years before they were permitted to come over
uh-huh
so
but i think unrestricted immigration i think is not best
yeah
i agree with that
i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted not only would the $unc$united $unc$states become more over populated awfully quickly i think it would bring in a lot of people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in other countries
i think theyd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime
uh-huh
theres another aspect of this too
theyre also diminishing the health restrictions which
i was not aware of that
yes
there were some regulations over
i dont know whether theyre laws passed or whatever theyre called just recently where people with certain diseases cannot be excluded from immigration
age is $unc$one for example
and recently tuberculosis which at $unc$one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country they dropped that also
uh-huh
so i think in some ways we are becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense
but i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
again my opinion
yeah
think weve talked long enough
i think so
all right
ive enjoyed talking to you
i have talked long enough
okay
thanks
thank you
bye
good-bye
hi
how are you today
im great
good
as a matter of fact before we started this conversation i was working on my p c at home
yeah
do you have $unc$one
no
i dont have $unc$one at home
i work with $unc$one at work continually
yeah
but i do not have $unc$one of my own at home
do you have
what do you have at home
we have an
its a $unc$t $unc$i computer
but it is the $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m clone
uh-huh
its not the $unc$t $unc$i p c from back when
right
from the oldies but the goodies
right
its probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work
i have a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six $unc$s $unc$x which is $unc$t $unc$i computer
but everything is in $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m mode
so
yeah
thats what we have
do you use it a lot at home
i really do
i am an accountant
but i work at home
uh-huh
uh-huh
so youre on it a lot
so i use it for that quite often
uh-huh
we have used some of it for some personal things
we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it
i
since its tax season im doing a lot of taxes
so i do a lot of that work on it as well
i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person
and she works out of her home also
uh-huh
and the software that does the taxes is just incredible
it is
she just
i expected to go and drop the stuff off and go back $unc$two weeks later
and she had it done and out in $unc$twenty minutes on her little p c
yeah
you can
it was great
yes
you can
thats right
thats wonderful
i have often thought that having $unc$one at home would be neat
i just dont know if we would really use it that much
we really
we didnt decide to get $unc$one until i started working at home
uh-huh
then we thought we can use it for some personal things
we di-
for us it really took a business application to justify the expense of it
uh-huh
definitely
definitely
i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer i guess probably $unc$three years ago for $unc$christmas
and its got some stuff on it
its got a nice little word processing software on it and some budgeting type things and stuff
and i dont think shes ever touched it
really
it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home
she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer
so
right
she could just as easily do those things by hand
yeah
just as quickly
yeah
now i know my boss has bought the software that his checkbook is on a disk
uh-huh
and he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print
and they print out on the checks
and hes ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places
my gosh
and he just whips out
i saw him yesterday morning over there
and he paid his monthly bills
and he just wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print
and it printed out $unc$ten checks
and he just
theyre perforated
and he just ripped them off
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer
right
and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes
and there they went
and he said i can balance my checkbook in seconds because its all in the computer
right
so
and theres not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
thats exactly why
he said used to be i always sat looking for those
he said this way there isnt any
it does it for you
so this
there are definitely some advantages to it
its just a matter of like you say does it justify the cost if youre using it strictly for personal business
so
right
i think in most cases id have to say no
not unless somebody really enjoys it or perhaps is using it for education
right
i have a $unc$four year old son
and we have some education programs that he likes
a little $unc$sesame $unc$street one
yeah
yeah
and we have another one that plays music
and he really likes that one
as he grows up hell be even more and more too
thats right
thatll be great
and yeah
on
now i think about it
i guess for kids as they get older
especially now when they get to junior high school and even college
uh-huh
my sister went to college started about $unc$three years ago
and she had to have a computer
really
it was like a necessity
yeah
i
she couldnt imagine going through college without a computer
im going through right now
im going part time in the evenings
and i do
yeah
everything has to be typed
they require it
you have to type it
right
and so im up here nights and weekends working on the p c up here typing stuff
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have $unc$one at home if you were going to school
yeah
any more i dont even know if a college kid would have a typewriter
you
i dont know
probably not even
no
no
no
and they probably used to have it
i just finished a major research paper a couple of weeks ago
and i couldnt imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it
uh-huh
i dont know what they used to do before they
in our family my husband and i went through college together
and then he went on and got his masters degree while i was working
uh-huh
and im the better typist of us
uh-huh
and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then
and you had to type all of his papers
it wasnt that long ago
but i typed his masters papers and things on a typewriter
gosh
boy to have a computer back then
cut your time in half at least
at least
at least
and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over
you take out a sentence
on a computer you take it out print it out fine
uh-huh
take out a sentence on a piece of paper
you do the whole thing over
right
thats right
i remember when i was working in high school i was working in an office right after i got out of high school
i continued working there for probably another year
and we did everything on a typewriter everything
yeah
but its amazing
then when someone would have you type a letter they did it right
they were
the first time
yeah
they sit there
and they go is this really what i want to say
and you typed it
and that was it
and now people just send it back over and over and over and over
thats probably $unc$one of the problems and frustrations that its brought about because people do feel like we can just change it
well try this out and see what it looks like
yeah
yeah
use it as just a
yeah
instead of knowing what they want to say before they just play with it which in a way is nice to be able to do
right
but it gets a little out of hand sometimes
ive seen it get out of hand up here where weve got a secretary that sits over here thats keeping metrics right now and keeping up of all the letters i type how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes
yeah
are they typos
are they because i couldnt read it
or people just change $unc$one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
and shes also keeping what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason
uh-huh
and theres $unc$one week she did retypes on $unc$ninety percent of what she typed
i believe it
and its ridiculous
and that was the high week
but its running about $unc$seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to $unc$seventy percent of everything that she types
uh-huh
its good that she does that bring it to peoples attention
thats exactly right
she keeps several weeks worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show look this didnt really need to be changed
this is ridiculous and changing add this time to now
thats the kind of things that shes keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste to change something like that
right
anyway maybe itll help in some way
but i dont know
there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
i have to
without a doubt
without a doubt
i would like to get $unc$one at home some day
weve got a $unc$two year old son
and so some day i would like to get even just the video or something like that just to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful
so
especially when theyre in school i think they would get a lot out of it
i do too
i do too
the on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful
that sounds like such a great idea
itd be kind of fun to be able to play with it
i know my father had a p c
and when we were in high school it was always fun
we could link in
and i dont even remember now what it was called
but you could link in and talk to people all over the country
uh-huh
and you have your own little code name
and youd type in du du du hi how are you du du du
and theyd type back and everybody
and youd have $unc$five or $unc$six or $unc$seven people talking to each other at the same time
and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as theyre typing it
and it was just great fun
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance
it was like a long distance phone call
ooh
so we were each limited to $unc$twenty minutes a day
so
ooh
that still could add up
it added up big
my parents were divorced
and so the time we were visiting our father in the summer time
so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it
yeah
im sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations
but when youre doing the guilty father complex because hes not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff
thats sad
it was nice to talk to you
yeah
you too
have a
have a nice day
you too
bye-bye
bye
okay
first of all i want to tell you i have $unc$two little kids
but theyre not in public school yet
i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
yeah
yeah
so you havent really dealt with that in a sense
no
but being $unc$one of these late in life mothers ive listened to everybody elses complaints as to whats the matter with either their kids or the school system
yeah
so ive been surprised
yeah
do you have school age kids
mine are both out of school
oh
and ive in hindsight seen some things that i wished that i had done something about that was within my power or wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over whats happening up there type thing
such as
just over the years there were situations that came up that i didnt think were fair or handled correctly
or the teachers didnt seem to be teaching anything
of course its a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child
uh-huh
they bring things home
and i was never one to believe everything my kids said about something
but still i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to really do a bang-up job
and yet others i know are just wonderful
i heard a frightening thing
i didnt hear it
it was told to me or suggested to me that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of $unc$texas
and i think its similar in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of people to teach math and sciences
and somebody said you could go in and substitute teach at $unc$seventy-five dollars a day
and theres always going to be somebody having a need for a math or science teacher
i thought theyre letting me in to
yeah
this would be frightening
i dont know anything about it
thats pretty interesting just because you know a subject matter doesnt mean you can teach it
right
right
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i dont know if id know how to handle that kind of a group of kids
yeah
in fact i think thats $unc$one of the big problems today is the way the kids behave or act and the way they are sometimes disinterested in whats going on in the class and disruptive
i tell you what im finding frightening
and this comes from the aging hippie near $unc$forty mother
so i went through this period of supposedly cosmic social enlightenment
im in the $unc$plano school system and living in $unc$richardson
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
uh-huh
and i used to think thats wonderful
they can get a real life experience
what im seeing now in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in different preschools its like day and night
uh-huh
and i wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesnt even speak english let alone know her colors
yeah
and theyre in the same classrooms
and i guess also youre going to see the first of the crack kids starting kindergarten
my god i think it would be next year is what id read
i thought how do you weed those out
yes
some of those certainly have a lot of difficulties with all sorts of things
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
when i was listening to $unc$n $unc$p $unc$r the $unc$national $unc$public $unc$radio
and theyve quoted statistics that my throat just about fell into my toes
they said at the bottom of the $unc$s $unc$a $unc$t scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
wow
yes
thats encouraging
yes
and i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry the people that took the lower level courses i sometimes wondered are they really even educatable or trainable
and it
my $unc$god i-
are the rest of us who went for the big bucks staying out of where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids
yeah
i dont know
thats an idea
maybe there need to be some radical changes made
do some things that are totally different and unheard of
you sit here
and you think about that
at the same time you think i hope i dont sound like a stage mother because right now if you ask my friends t- put $unc$twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children youre going to have $unc$twenty hands up there
youre kidding
no
nobody has a nongifted child
and i keep thinking gifted is $unc$einstein or musical prodigies
its not a kid whos precocious
yeah
you know what has the educational system been watered down to that anybody whos above average is now gifted
i dont know
thats interesting
i dont know
mine did not fall into the gifted category
dont say that
nope
and i would never had said so either
but they managed to get through although not always with flying colors
in fact $unc$one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had he was struggling with senior english
and i had a meeting with the vice principal and the english instructor
and she showed me a paper that he had just handed in
and she told me what she had requested
and i read it
and while it had a few little grammatical problems it wasnt very long and so forth
i thought it had some nice well thought out parts to it
uh-huh
she gave him an $unc$f on that paper
and i thought now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject
and you give them an $unc$f on something that doesnt seem that bad to me
what are you telling that student
youre telling them that you might as well forget it
i think that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years
because i have a stepson now whos $unc$twenty-five
and i was just absolutely shocked the first time that i saw his schoolwork
i remember being taught
and i think you have to teach how to write an answer and how to construct a thought process
uh-huh
and they can grasp the points
can they convey the data verbally or in writing
and thats whats really scary to me
i would really
theres such a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age
and if they cant if they have missed that training then somebody before youre start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what theyre thinking teach them these basic skills
yeah
its pretty sad to think about those who even today are graduating from school
and they are telling that they dont know how to read
my stepson he went into the $unc$navy or $unc$air $unc$force
i just really get my military
i married into a military family
and i dont know
i address them all as generals
so i dont offend anybody
but fortunately for him he wasnt dumb
but he sure had trouble putting things on paper
yeah
and $unc$one of the things that they did for him they tested him
and they said that hes great in electronics
but he really does need the basic skills
and they put him through $unc$six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training
and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
oh
this is the kid who really barely made it through high school
yeah
and i keep thinking its really not too late at any point to do some-
thats interesting that the military saw that and did something about it
yes
you would have expected them to be the last ones to
yes
and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations
but i think that for this kid its going to be his lifesaver
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses from here to eternity
yeah
so i dont know
it does make me nervous
i can see why if youve got little ones just coming along
theres a whole lot of stuff going on out there
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there
and part of me says i just would like to shut my eyes and pretend it doesnt go on or send them to private schools
and then the old social conscience says im not working i dont need to work
maybe i should volunteer to teach what i know
yeah
maybe adult literacy maybe composition writing maybe volunteering on a tutor line or even through the elementary schools for help with homework
or the other part of me says is $unc$god ive had enough kids
do i reall-
what type of lawn and garden work do you do
i do it all
i see
do you have a garden
yes
i try to grow a vegetable garden
and
we do the same thing
i just have a small plot its $unc$ten feet by $unc$five feet
yeah
i have $unc$two plots
ones $unc$ten by $unc$ten
and ones $unc$fifteen by $unc$four
i see
its a long skinny one
and
yeah
you do a lot more area than i do
ive
all the rest of my backyard is pool and decking
its all the dirt i have left in my backyard
i see
yeah
i see
i enjoy fiddling around
its cheap entertainment
right
right
yeah
its nice to get out in the open air
it is
uh-huh
and especially when the weathers not too hot or not raining or whatever
thats right
yeah
but sometimes i wish i had more space
i enjoy
go ahead
uh-huh
i grow a lot of things a lot of food
uh-huh
and sometimes i want to plant something theres not enough room to plant some of those things like the things that vine cucumbers or squash or something like that plant $unc$one of those
thats right
thats right
uh-huh
uh-huh
takes a lot of room
and it takes up your whole space
it sure does
i made mistake $unc$one year and planted some cantaloupe
my goodness what a mistake that was
yeah
yeah
they just run all over the place dont they
they do
it was very good
it just takes up like you say a lot of your garden area
right
right
its the first and only time ive done that
we dont do anything exotic
we just do tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips not turnips carrots beets and things like that
the basics
right
yeah
thats what we do too
my wife used to plant a few snow peas
i dont really care for snow peas
she just plants a few for herself
right
peas
yeah
i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago
did you really
the first one they started them indoors this time
i read it
i see
and so i
okay
we dont start anything indoors
we just wait until the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
yeah
i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
probably so
yeah
you can get a head start on it
but sure is a heck of a lot of work
i guess it would
because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered
yeah
uh-huh
and i dont think ill do it again
it will make them taste better im sure
yeah
yeah
i enjoy it
i come home from work
and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle just walk around the yard and inspect it
sure
you got to inspect it
yeah
and the kids want to swing
sure
and i push them on swing
sure
and i mow my own lawn
yeah
and i dont have a sprinkler system
i dont enjoy watering
no
especially
i
this is the first home weve lived in weve had a sprinkler system
how
and it is really nice
oh
it sure beats dragging hoses around
yeah
you can have it come on just early in the morning and off by the time youre up and about
thats right
thats right
its really nice
yeah
i usually get it started for my wife
uh-huh
and she moves it around ever other day
ill have to admit i do my own yard
i really dont enjoy doing that
i enjoy having a nice looking yard
uh-huh
i just dont enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
uh-huh
yeah
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months until i retired
uh-huh
and now ive lost my excuse for that so i have to
for the last couple of years ive done it myself
yeah
sometimes i wish i could get $unc$one of these chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that $unc$one step out of
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they want too much money
it is kind of expensive
it is
yeah
of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them theyre expensive too
right
right
but its still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself
thats right
if i have a problem discipline i think
boy i really need to get out and apply something
and i screw around and dont do it or wait too long or something
right
and the weed come up
thats right
and all of a sudden youve got to do something else
thats right
im kind of bad about that
yeah
i enjoyed having a lawn service
but now i have the time
and i really dont want to spend the money for it
if you enjoy it too you can get out in the morning before it gets hot and do it and stuff when you only have to
yeah
thats right
im not limited to just mowing it on $unc$saturday morning
right
i can do it on most any day of the week
when the days start getting a little longer i can start doing it in the evening after work
uh-huh
thats right
when they switch
yeah
when we get an hour more
yeah
when they rollback an hour
thats coming up here pretty soon
is it this weekend
i dont know
its pretty soon
i really dont know
it just seems like i here it on the news the day before
yeah
and i think its coming up here soon
i believe it is too
yeah
yeah
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden
not a whole lot
i seldom use anything harsher than $unc$seven dust
uh-huh
i dont really like to put a lot chemicals on it
but then again i dont want the bugs eating it upping either
right
right
i
it seems like they come in spurts
uh-huh
$unc$one year i didnt put anything on
and i didnt have any problems
uh-huh
next year i was planting some broccoli and some of those theyre called cabbage loppers or whatever
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
they were just covered with them
yeah
i went up
i didnt go out there for about $unc$three days and i went out there $unc$one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem
uh-huh
thats right
they devoured it that quickly
absolutely
they really go through it
and they have a good appetite
they really do
yeah
and they would
i picked off $unc$twenty of them
and
cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too
ye-
yeah
boy theyll strip
they got that what is that safer soap $unc$b $unc$t spray this year
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and ive been watching them every day
and i havent seen any signs yet
so if i see any signs im going to spray them
yeah
and
i did something a little bit different this year that i havent done before
ive got
my garden is shaped that i can
its kind like this box shape
so i got $unc$four pieces of $unc$two by $unc$twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch $unc$eight $unc$hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
right
and various other things raised it up
the good stuff
right
and im hoping especially with those big tall sides on there that maybe ill have less of a bug problem
at least theyll have a hard time crawling up the thing
right
yeah
my backyard is sloping
so i built a box up had to build the low side up
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i had sandy loam hauled in
i had a dump truck come and dump it
uh-huh
on my driveway i guess thats what they do
and then i had to wheel barrow it in
yeah
right
but you can improve your own soil there
uh-huh
but the $unc$texas soil isnt the greatest gardening soil
thats right
you have to work on
you really do
right
and if i didnt wait $unc$five years for it to be good enough grow
you know what i mean
thats right
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam for my garden
so i had a lot of loam out there to start with
i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with
uh-huh
do you have a rotor tiller
no
i dont
i did it by hand
small enough
you have a
just do it by hand
uh-huh
yeah
it wasnt too much of a job really
yeah
yeah
like i say its just
yeah
id like to get $unc$one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines
uh-huh
uh-huh
it would be handy
and it weighs $unc$twenty pounds or something like that
yeah
my neighbor across the street has $unc$one
he always uses it to dethatch his lawn
uh-huh
i see him out there
yeah
and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it
it might be handy
yeah
yeah
theyre pretty neat little
ive never seen $unc$one
i have a friend who has $unc$one
and he lets me no problem borrowing if its just a hassle to go up
uh-huh
yeah
and its a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it if i just go to my garage and grab it
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah
that would be neat
sure
that would be nice
weve had a garden for years and years and years of some size
uh-huh
i cant remember a year when we didnt have $unc$one of some kind
what have you got growing right now
got
you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
uh-huh
and ive got a few carrots up
and ive got some radishes up
uh-huh
and as a matter of fact ive already done a second row of radishes
uh-huh
yeah
and the green onions are coming along
okay
snow
what kind
what kind of onions do you grow
do you grow those $unc$ten $unc$fifteen y
yes
ive
for the first time we planted them this year
they are the best
yeah
we tried to find them last year
we screwed around and waited too long
and i couldnt find a nursery that had any of them left
uh-huh
uh-huh
but weve got some this year
those
snow peas are up
and my wife does a small herb garden on the side
i see
theyre up and doing fine
yeah
i
those onions i think we planted twice as much this year because we got onions
and they lasted from when you harvest them about a month from now or so or $unc$six weeks from now until $unc$october
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just cant compare
yeah
yeah
thats kind of a let down
she made these onion rings that were so good
i bet
and you dont realize how many dishes you put onions in that its an ingredient
they were
thats right
we use a lot
we sure do
and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
yeah
$unc$one nice thing with onions and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have too many
right
right
we froze a lot of peppers
we let some turn red
yeah
uh-huh
we did that too
and some we do green
and then my wife puts them on pizzas and chops them up in recipes and things like that
uh-huh
sure
makes a colorful salad too
yeah
put them in salad
yeah
uh-huh
youre making me hungry here
we planted some yellow peppers this year
weve tried it before
oh
and nope
we havent had much luck with it were going to try it again this year
yellow peppers
they have some little buds on them hopefully theyll do something
yeah
sounds like you have a real good garden
yeah
we enjoy fooling around with it
just let me see what i got
i got the peas
and ive got some broccoli onions some radishes and beets
beets
yeah
weve got some beets
uh-huh
and i planted potatoes too
uh-huh
ive never done potato
we used to do it at home when i was a kid had a huge garden
the potato
theyre delicious
but they
you dont seem to get that much for the space
uh-huh
they do
it does take some space
some potatoes
yeah
and ive got some tomatoes still growing in containers
uh-huh
i see
i got to wait for a place to free up
uh-huh
our kids love pickles
and we all love pickles
so were going to try to grow our own pickles this year
uh-huh
that will be neat
yeah
weve got some good $unc$hybrid $unc$burpee pickler cucumbers
uh-huh
and were going to try to see if we can pickle our own
that will be neat
yeah
absolutely
theyre expensive
i know it
i said why are they so expensive theyre just a bunch of little cucumbers
i dont know unless it labor intensive or something
i really dont know
i guess
but were going to try that and see how that works
that will be interesting
an experiment
yeah
id like to just try something new every year that i havent tried before
sure
yeah
and
thats interesting
ill let you go its
all right
okay
are you on an exercise program now
or
yeah
i exercise pretty regularly
uh-huh
i lift weights quite a bit
uh-huh
i run occasionally
lets see what else do i do play golf some
and i work out on a hanging bag
im brown belt in karate
so i keep up with that a little bit
uh-huh
yeah
how about you
the only exercise program im doing right now is walking
uh-huh
ive got a $unc$nine month old
and im $unc$four months pregnant with my second
and so at the time walking seems to be the best
its something i can do with her plus doesnt tax me too physically
uh-huh
i have enjoyed aerobics in the past
and i enjoy that because i like the group association like exercising with other people
yeah
and thats my favorite way to exercise
thats neat
yeah
i do walk some too
my wifes about $unc$five months along
oh
so shes been walking quite a bit
so that is a good exercise for that
yeah
its nice to do it together too i guess
uh-huh
my husband and i use to walk together
but our schedules dont coincide as well as they used to
and so we very seldom get together to walk
but when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule
or do you go to groups
or
i do it on my own schedule
uh-huh
we used to try and belong to clubs or the $unc$y stuff like that
but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive the distance you have to go
uh-huh
save the fees
weve just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment
so
and then you can do it whenever you want i guess
yeah
ive got a weight bench
and we got my wife an exercise bike
and i use that sometimes too
uh-huh
its a little more convenient
but i guess youre not as dedicated if you dont drive over to do it
i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are
uh-huh
because my husband used to work out $unc$three days a week at the $unc$texas $unc$instruments gym
uh-huh
and then i would just go on $unc$saturdays
but since the first of the year neither $unc$one of us have been going
yeah
so i guess like i say weve been paying these fees and not going
so its kind of a waste of money if you dont take advantage of it
yeah
i think you really have to be disciplined
yeah
i try to work out at least a couple of times a week
and i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that youre in
yeah
with the walking i think they said you need to walk at least $unc$twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial
uh-huh
and i have $unc$two friends that we walk
they have babies that are about the same ages as mine
and weve been walking every morning going
when it was cold we would go to the mall because you cant take the babies out very easily
yeah
so when we go we do about $unc$fifteen miles a week
but the last little while for $unc$one reason or another we havent been real consistent
so its a little harder when youre depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well
uh-huh
but i enjoy doing it more when ive got other people with me
sure
i usually do it because i want to because i know its good for me not because i dont feel obligated to do it
i enjoy it
if i feel too obligated to do it
i start to rebel
and i wont be as consistent with it
yeah
i understand
did you exercise between your first child and your second
i exercised pretty well up until i was pregnant
and i started having pains
so ive calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the walking
yeah
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful
but the $unc$t $unc$i rec center has an aerobics program for prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing
and i was going to wait until about my sixth month and then start that
i did that with the second baby
and i went to my exercise class $unc$one day
and then she was delivered the next day
gosh
so it would seem to be real beneficial
uh-huh
yeah
maybe it speeded up the process and all that
i think it made parts of it a lot easier
and is this your first that youre having
uh-huh
okay
then i dont know how much youve been through it
but i think parts of it made a lot easier
and ive talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with $unc$one pregnancy and didnt with the other
and they said that the $unc$one they had exercised with was $unc$three or $unc$four times easier
really
and i had
having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second
and its rough
but its not as bad as i thought it would be
and i think the exercise helped
thats good
so do you work with $unc$t $unc$i
no
i dont
my wife has been working with them
okay
then she could go if she were interested
uh-huh
i think thats what the class that meets on $unc$saturday mornings
so she could find out if she wanted to go
its kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except $unc$one were on their first pregnancy
and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process
and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial
so
at least its something you enjoy
i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say i dont want to exercise its too much work
but theres a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you dont have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards
thats right
yeah
and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like ive done a good job because i worked myself to that point
but i guess that you dont want to overdo
but have we reached our limit
im not sure how long weve been talking
but
yeah
i think weve talked about $unc$six minutes or so
okay
its been good talking to you
been good talking to you as well
okay
i hope your baby comes out well
thanks
yours too
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what do you think
i dont know im thinking about from $unc$one to $unc$ten what my no would be
it would probably be somewhere closer to less control because i dont see
im not a member of the $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a although my father is
uh-huh
but i think the $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a has gone overboard the wrong way
yeah
theyre sitting there on number $unc$ten
theyre saying absolutely no gun control we dont even want to think about it
and i think thats a dumb situation
yeah
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose if youre going to hunt with it or if youre going to do sport shooting you can wait a week
uh-huh
right
thats true
its not a big deal for them to go
if theyre can check your driver s license every time you get a ticket they should be able to go back and find out if youve had any kind of armed felony record
right
thats true
any of that kind of stuff
and it seems to me right now that theres not that much of a check
im not really sure what $unc$texas law i think theres a check for felonies on your record
right
but
if the gun shop owner does it
uh-huh
but
yeah
but he has to go out and do it
thats true i think
yeah
and if its a private sale of course then theres nothing
right
and thats my only problem with
making you
get the check and everything is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys
they are going to get a gun no matter what
uh-huh
theyre not
i dont think theyre going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when theres a check
i think theyre going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that
yes
but maybe well prevent a few $unc$john $unc$hinckleys
yeah
i hope
thats true
i
thats the kind of people
like i say i dont think the guy whos going to rob a $unc$seven $unc$eleven is going to rob a $unc$seven $unc$eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or whatever yeah
knife
exactly
hes going to do what he wants to do
thats true
i just think it makes honest people more honest
and
and the people who want it its not that big a deal like i say to wait
right
right
and if you have to have it in a hurry somethings wrong
yeah
it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here
thats right
thats right
oh
im married to a policeman
so we talk about this a lot
yeah
i imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the $unc$one there on the scale of $unc$one to $unc$ten he needs some more
yeah
yeah
yeah
i was watching a
gosh
if i was a cop i would be
worried about that
too many people have too much access
yeah
they do
they do
and i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu-
some of these $unc$saturday night specials that these companies put out theyre are
right
basically it says here buy me and go rob a $unc$seven $unc$eleven
right
or even the little toy guns look real
yes
thats really gotten bad
ive heard so much about that on tv
and thats kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding $unc$one
or your child accidently
yeah
if your child is old enough
there are a lot of kids who when theyre $unc$ten look like theyre $unc$twelve or $unc$fourteen and especially some of the minority children whether a racist or not
right
uh-huh
thats the truth
and if some of them are doing something that they shouldnt be and then they have $unc$one of those toy guns in their hands
and a cop comes up
right
you cant blame them
it looks like theyve got a weapon
you cant
jeez and you cant take the chances
thats right
because theres been kids that age who have killed people
exactly
and there was a law i think its in $unc$oregon where theyve now made all toy guns
theyre making them neon colors
right
and i think thats a good idea
yeah
and the kids dont care
thats right
my kid didnt care
i know
he picks up a stick and goes bang
right
right
it doesnt make any difference to him
a gun is a gun to them
yeah
they can play with anything and make it a gun
thats exactly right
yeah
so you like to do
i think they ought to do that with toy guns
they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them
right
right
exactly
so that theyre not very distinguishable from a real gun
thats right
thats a good idea
i was watching t v yesterday
and there is a town in $unc$georgia
and its the law that you have a gun
every adult is able to carry a gun
and they encourage it
thats kind of
they encourage it
yeah
and the police love it
which really surprised me
i think and thats what they were going after they went to interview this town
its a little dinky town
they went to interview them about the gun control laws
and all the people said thats fine we could care less
were all honest and everything like that
we all carry them
but we dont mind being checked
and i think it kind of took that neatness away from it
heck everybodys got $unc$one
so it was quite unusual to see the people in that town
i dont know
i
thats kind of an odd thing
i dont know
i have a gun
and my folks have always had
i learned to shoot when i was real little
uh-huh
i think thats a lot of it too is that people need to teach their kids what to do and what not to do
right
exactly
because my dad started letting me shoot a little air b b gun when i was probably $unc$five or $unc$six years old
uh-huh
yeah
but it was
this is how you hold
this is the only place that you do it which was out far and away
right
and you dont ever touch it unless im here
and you dont point it at people
thats what were doing
and then they had
then they went to the $unc$texas $unc$parks and $unc$recreation i guess
but anyway the hunter safety program that you have to do now
yeah
i think it started in about $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy
oh
if you want to go deer hunting
and your birthdays after $unc$nineteen something $unc$fifty-five or something then you have to attend $unc$one of these hunter safety courses
uh-huh
thats neat
or you cant get a deer license
thats real neat
and its basic stuff
its like when youre climbing over a barbed wire fence dont lean your gun against it
yeah
and then you crawl over it and shoot yourself
right
and those things happen
thats real good
it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
right
right
and they usually are real basic common sense things
yeah
put the safety on the gun
always assume its loaded
thats got to be the most common thing that people
i know
and people dont want to believe that
yeah
its empty
its empty
boom!
yeah
i
i took the clip out or whatever
and i forgot about the $unc$one in the chamber
oh
yeah
were trying to teach our daughter
she knows real well about her daddys guns what not to do and what to do around them
yeah
does he got them locked up all the time too
when hes
yeah
and shes real
shell know
shell even tell her friends dont ever touch my daddys guns or something like that
dont even think about it
yeah
yeah
so shes real good about it
and shes never been curious
cause hes always
if he has them out cleaning them she can be there
and hell tell how hes doing it or show her the insides or stuff like that
yeah
if you make it where its not something curious
to be feared
and
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about
right
exactly
if its just $unc$one more piece of something
but theyve got to understand like you said never touch it
right
theyd have that respect for what it does and what it can do
yeah
ours is a
we have a shotgun
and its up in the closet
uh-huh
and then the shells are in another part
and its something to think about
and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out
he was out of the country at $unc$one time for $unc$three months
yeah
and i was like i live in a nice neighborhood
but still
still
and then ive got it so far
sometimes i wonder if im not about to load it because i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there
uh-huh
and its in a case
and its put up
and its away and all that
right
but i dont want to take the chance
and i think if somebody ever does break in its going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it
hes got to go to a lot of trouble
yeah
hold on
hold on
yeah
hes in here somewhere
i know he is
right
yeah
i know how to use $unc$one
we go hunting every once in a while
and he showed me how to use his guns
and i really enjoy it
but boy if someone did break in i dont know that i could or would even grab it
i know
i used to think about that
it was a lot easier when i was single
it was $unc$one thing
and when i was just married with no kids when it was just me it was an easy decision
uh-huh
thats true
yeah
it was like you come after me youre going to get it
yes
and now theres so many other things where are the kids what are they doing where is this person coming in from
yeah
right
youve got
and if you manage to get it out
then how can you even afford to think about what youre going to do because you dont know where your kids are at the same time
true
true
we have dogs that are very protective
ugh
we feel if they make enough noise that
yeah
if theyre stupid enough to come through then
yeah
it
we have $unc$two big dogs in the backyard and always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer
yeah
yeah
theyve got to be pretty stupid
and most people that break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily
yeah
anything that the
any advantage that they can take
right
and thats $unc$one of them
so
unfortunately
yeah
guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years
yeah
really does
do you think weve
yeah
i think thats about all i can
me too on gun control
were in pretty good agreement actually on it
yeah
i think we are
it would be even more interesting you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum
right
right
im glad youre not
me too
im glad to find theres another reasonable person in $unc$garland
okay
good!
its been nice talking to you
you too
thanks
bye-bye
bye-bye
what kind of lawn and garden work do you do
right now the place where im living the yard was basically neglected for about the last $unc$twenty-five years
so ive been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn
and after $unc$three years of working at it ive been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back
instead of mowing in the same direction every time changing $unc$one time youll cut the lawn the long way then youll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width
and it helps the grass come back
does it really
i didnt know that
youve been working on it for $unc$three years
for $unc$three years
really
what have you done
killing lots of fire ants
i was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but $unc$one gigantic ant mound
uh-huh
because it was like you couldnt even stand still out there
i can barely hear you
is this better
yeah
a little bit
it was like youd go out in the yard to water something youd just be standing still
uh-huh
and the ants would start crawling up your legs
its like im not standing in a mound though
wow
how did you get rid of them
$unc$dursban $unc$two
pardon
a chemical called $unc$dursban $unc$two
$unc$dursban $unc$two
its a crystal
yeah
$unc$dursban will get rid of just about anything i think
so you havent had a problem with that since
not bad
every once in a while youll have a mound pop up
yeah
but thats to be expected
did it kill anything else it wasnt supposed to
not really
as far as i can tell it hasnt killed anything it wasnt supposed to
even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didnt kill it
yeah
really
thats pretty wild
yeah
we used it for fleas
we had fleas in our yard real bad last year
and we did that
im not
basically i like to mow the lawn believe it or not
but i sometimes have problems starting the mower
so a lot of times i wont get out and do it
but my husband basically does most of it
and he does the edging and all that kind of thing
and were renting
and so we dont really put a lot of money into the
this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some $unc$saint $unc$augustine
we have winter rye out back
and we have
i dont even know what it is out front
but this is the first house weve ever lived in
and were just not real into the lawn probably because were renting i guess
so it anyway
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard
right
uh-huh
we were getting
i found $unc$one thing that its kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn
but every time ive done it drives the fleas completely out of the area
what
powdered sulphur
really
i wonder why it does
you dont have to put a whole lot out
just if youve got a broadcast spreader i think it comes in a forty-pound bag
uh-huh
and its real fine like flour
uh-huh
and you just go out and do the entire yard
yeah
and you dont have to put clumps of it
just very lightly cover the entire yard
really
ill have to remember that because hopefully we wont have them this year
but we have a cat that comes in and out
and the cat was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house
so we had a real problem last year with fleas
and it was quite a drag because we got them in our house
and were $unc$christians
and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas
and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do
but we did
and so we dont want them back this year
so ill remember that if we see its a problem in the yard
were almost
they were so bad last year even ticks
i dont know
weve had ticks before a lot
and weve had to get out and treat our lawn for that
we used $unc$dursban and $unc$diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing and spread it all out everywhere
but thats about the extent of our lawn care
so i dont know
do you enjoy doing it
i love it
my wife cant understand
itd be a $unc$hundred degrees outside ill be out there
but its too hot to be working in the yard
im under the trees
im having fun
and im stopping to drink water
so whats the problem
yeah
thats funny
yeah
not everybody enjoys it though
everybody has a different thing
i kind of enjoy it
and my husband doesnt
i kind of have to
sometimes im too busy to get out there and do it
and he doesnt really enjoy doing it
but hell do it
and he doesnt gripe about it or anything
but im kind of like you
and hes kind of like your wife
in that he doesnt really enjoy it
but i would like to have a garden
thats my thing
but right now where were living we have the trees where their roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground
i dont know what kind of trees they are
but you cant have a garden
you cant till it
or itll tear up a nice tiller
so were going to wait until we move
we dont have a lot of sun either because its big trees back there
so were going to wait
and when we move thats $unc$one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a garden
and so id like to do that
i have a feeling ill be out there all the time taking care of that
but thats our next thing
do you have a garden
ive got the
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at sitting on about a $unc$two acre lot now
uh-huh
and the back half is my garden
are you kidding
that sounds fun
where do you all live
in $unc$missouri $unc$city
really
wh-
southwest side of $unc$houston
southwest where
southwest $unc$houston
really
because were in $unc$dallas
i guess i assumed you were here
thats neat
and yeah
thats what we want
we have a
yeah
thats really what we want
but we just havent been able to do that yet
so $unc$one day well be able to do it
and im excited about it
and then i dont know anything about it
i have to learn
and then youll have to give me a call on gardening
what do you do in your garden
and ill go nothing
what should i do
but anyway i guess thats about it though
it sounds like weve covered all the bases
so i guess well let you go
and do you have anything else you wanted to say
no
its just ive had an very enjoyable conversation with you
okay
i know you too
i hope you have a nice day
and well talk to you later
okay
you too
okay
bye
bye
okay
okay
do you believe only $unc$fifty percent of the people actually vote
i think its somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their $unc$one little vote is not going to make that much difference
and they really dont listen to any of the issues anymore
because they feel like so many of the politicians are crooked
uh-huh
and so they figure why go out and vote
theyre going to do what they want to do
theyre corrupt anyway
and i think $unc$one of the good ways of solving that is everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something
thats the only thing that i can figure out because ive heard so many people say im not voting on that one im going to go fishing today or it wont make any difference if i dont vote
and i think it does
we vote every time
theres no question it does make a difference
so far as having a party and then all voting when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct
right
because people have to vote in different areas
and not everyone votes at the same place
i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that $unc$one vote does make a difference
but
right
and maybe let them have some mock elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young
absolutely
absolutely
thats a real good idea
and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them country wide
but its going to take at least a whole generation of people to get across the idea of voting
just like its taking a whole generation of people to finally realize the harmfulness of drugs and hopefully now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs
right
how to say no to it and what have you
that
perhaps well finally get the youth weaned off of it
but i know i spent $unc$thirty-four years in education here in the $unc$dayton area
and in $unc$nineteen $unc$fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started
and that was in $unc$fifty-one
thats $unc$forty years ago that it was already a problem
god
so its now to the forefront
and people are finally taking some action against it
and weve neglected the value of voting and what it really means to vote
right
and we also dont make the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them
yeah
i dont know how it is up there
but down here $unc$louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all
uh-huh
im sure you heard about some of ours
sure
right
and people are just
its like theyre turned off on voting
and thats the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party
uh-huh
okay
were going to have a block party
everybodys going to get together
were going to discuss the different issues and stuff
and then were going to go and vote
were going to go vote
maybe they could give something like the top neighborhood if you had a $unc$hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that
it could be like a sign that they would put down at the end of your block or anything like that
uh-huh
but its really bad here
to me it is
it seems like people just dont care anymore
they say it dont make any difference
$unc$one crook is as good as the other one
yeah
and they dont bother to listen to what any of them have to say
right
and i know my husband now we go vote every time
i dont care how small the ballot is mean if theres $unc$one thing if theres $unc$one issue
uh-huh
right
because the way i feel is if i dont vote then i dont have any reason to gripe
to complain about it right
right
right
and i hear so many people saying i wish this would change i wish that
but they didnt go vote
thats right
and like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all and the importance of it because if you dont vote for your friend over here your friends not going to have a chance
thats right
tha-
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses
maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would
because i know here until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines
and you voted for cheerleaders and different things like that
yes
uh-huh
but they should start that a lot earlier
yeah
i
its the same way with everything in education though
it should begin right down in the first grade
and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns
and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning and not wait until theyre in high school
right
and then its too late to try to change them around at that point
yeah
but everything should be started on the lower levels
and certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
but youre right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
right
and perhaps its because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run that only the most wealthy can do so
right
and theyre not always the best person for the job
right
but they have the money to be able to do it
so there are a lot of problems along that line also
definitely
and perhaps the government
a good idea for the young kids like that too is to have a mock one
and this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen
sure
and this candidate tells you some things
right
then the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time
but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do
uh-huh
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them now youre not going to get to vote
but youre going to have to do what that person says
yes
they would understand probably by the time they were in high school
right
theyd be ready to vote
thats right
and i think thats an excellent idea
they would put them to realize that theyre going to have to do what someone else says even though they didnt vote for it and that maybe they need to think twice about voting
yeah
now some people object during primaries having to declare a party whether $unc$republican or $unc$democrat
right
and you do that in the primary
uh-huh
and i dont know that a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason
they can declare anything they want
and they can actually rig it
if they really wanted to vote $unc$republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting $unc$democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the $unc$republican could beat
but its just a sad situation
and i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to teach everyone more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting so that theyre making some more intelligent decisions
yeah
and its going to take these young
i think that sounds great
its going to take a whole generation of my feeling before thats going to be accomplished
theyd have to start when theyre real young
thats right
it would have to be a child that is just coming into school
because ill tell you another thing too now
the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
uh-huh
now this sounds dumb
but i did not know how to use those voting machines
and nobody ever showed us or anything
so i didnt vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them
yeah
they thought that was funny
she dont even know how wah wah
right
uh-huh
so there wasnt any way i was going to go in there and vote
and it took such courage you wouldnt believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didnt know how to work the machines
sure
right
well
sure it is
now thats bad
and i was out of school
i was a married person
uh-huh
and i didnt know how to work the machine
and it really scared me really bad
because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i dont know how to work this machine
where if theyd had a class or something or a short time said this is the way
just the opportunity to try the voting machines
yeah
right
this is the way its going to be
and my son was exactly the same way that i was
and i didnt realize it until his senior year
i asked him something about who did you vote for cheerleader
and he said i didnt go vote
he said theres no way im getting in that machine
then i realized it
so when we went and voted the next time i asked the lady i said i want my son to come in with me
and she said why
hell have to come back out
i said because i want him to know how to use $unc$one of these
right
and i said i wont turn any of the buttons down
but i want to show him how to use it so that hell be able to vote
yes
uh-huh
so he went in
and now hes a registered voter
good
but he would not vote before then
yeah
and i think thats bad
sure it is
absolutely
here i was
and even of course theres a lot of years between the $unc$two of us
but even with that many years between
okay
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next
what do we currently have
i have a $unc$subaru $unc$g $unc$o $unc$x $unc$t
what year
$unc$eighty-eight
okay
i have a $unc$ninety $unc$honda $unc$civic
and im ready to get rid of it
its not pretty old
no
i had an $unc$eighty-eight that i really liked
and it got wrecked
and so i bought a $unc$ninety because i really liked my $unc$eighty-eight
and ive had a lot of problems with this one
so
you think their quality controls going down over there kind of
you
its kind of funny
i know a lot
i think were going to see i think that the quality that the $unc$japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while american carmakers are trying to get their put together
oh
yeah
so
its true
its definitely true because
but thats $unc$one reason
ive had no problems with my $unc$subaru
thats $unc$one reason i went with it because $unc$subaru had a good reputation for low maintenance
so
yeah
$unc$honda does too thats why i was really
really
theres no question
but you have a $unc$nineteen
ive got to see if
ive seen and ive had friends that have $unc$eighty-one or $unc$eighty $unc$celicas
uh-huh
and those things just keep ticking
yeah
they can rack up a $unc$hundred $unc$fifty $unc$k on them
thats true
and theyre still beating on them
thats true
and its just amazing
and then they got
and theyre not making them like that now d- d-
no
not at all
but theyre still i think definitely better than the american carmaker system
i definitely agree with you there because i had $unc$ford $unc$t $unc$bird before i got my $unc$honda
and it was the worst car ive ever owned
yeah
and thats why i was so tickled with my $unc$honda
it was just a wonderful car
and then it got wrecked
and i wouldnt even look at another car
yeah
i just went and bought a $unc$honda i didnt look around or anything i just said that this is what i want
and i really have had a lot of problems with it
but i dont know
maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-
ill probably hold on to it since its still under warranty
but in the first $unc$twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month
it was in the shop about $unc$twelve times the first $unc$twelve months
yeah
thats a lot
yeah
it was
i was really disappointed because i was so hyped up on $unc$honda
so
well
yeah
anyway
so whats your next purchase supposed to be
i know this
really
if you had a choice of your car what would you get
this is going to sound really strange
but i really like to have a $unc$mazda $unc$m $unc$p $unc$v van
i really like those
and i have kids
so
im not sure im real familiar with the body style on that
theyre a lot
i dont like the new style like of the $unc$toyota van and the new $unc$chevy $unc$lumina van
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont like those styles the $unc$m $unc$p $unc$v is more just i dont know what you normal
i dont know how to explain more of an old fashioned type
im not sure how to explain it
yeah
it looks i guess kind of like the $unc$chevy $unc$aerostar or $unc$arrow
yeah
no
what
$unc$astro i guess is what it something like that
okay
yeah
but i used to really like the looks of the $unc$m $unc$p $unc$v because it looks more like a mini van rather than i think
do you have a family
yeah
i have a couple kids
okay
thats probably influenced maybe a little bit
yeah
definitely
but i know that its got to have a radio its got to have air conditioning
im sure you can relate to air conditioning living in $unc$arizona
yeah
and cruise control and tinted windows thats about it
its got to have those things otherwise i dont care
yeah
when i bought my car it was right out of college
and i always been looking for something sporty
and i ended up getting basically something that i could afford
uh-huh
the only gripe i have is performance
i probably
a few girls that ive gone out with ive had $unc$mazda $unc$r $unc$x sevens and stuff
and theyre pretty fun to drive
so i think thats what im going to have to get next time around i keep holding off
yeah
really
and then i could upgrade now if i wanted to
but i
its just such a huge expense
and im just going to keep holding off
but im definitely going to look for something in the nice perpor-
sports car
id like to have a sports car too
but its not practical for me
but
yeah
im in
are you still there
yeah
whoops
theres some kind of problems
hello
hello
are you still there
okay
this is
somethings wrong
wonder what happened
i dont know
it sounds funny though doesnt it
anyway but ill probably
it just depends
i know thats what i want
but i dont know if ill get myself to spend that kind of money
for a new $unc$r $unc$x $unc$seven or a $unc$supra or something youre looking at $unc$twenty-five $unc$k or something that like
at least
yeah
and so but anyway my ultimate car though the $unc$one that i really want is $unc$five $unc$sixty or so $unc$mercedes
i know new cars arent cheap anyway
but
so
maybe someday
yeah
we all have those kind of dreams too dont we
yeah
what id really like to have
thats the only one that i
i see early on it says you there
yeah
this is strange
hello
hello
i think somethings wrong with this
okay
i hope its recording
i hope its not my
you there
yeah
it may be my phone
anyway its the only car that says sporty and class
so
yeah
youre right
yeah
kind of what im
but its
at the other one my brothers got a $unc$miata
and those are fun
those are nice
and yeah
yeah
theyre cute cars
he had a red $unc$miata
uh-huh
and he actually
they came out with a european racing green $unc$miata thats a limited edition
oh
theyre only going to make $unc$three or $unc$four $unc$thousand
so he went out
and he traded the other one in and got this $unc$one
i havent seen those
and im like but i havent seen $unc$one yet either
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to the clutch and all this and the steering wheel
wow
so its very authentic
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be a good investment
if it
yeah
definitely
yeah
no matter what it is if its a limited edition its usually worth something later on
uh-huh
but i think
hello
yeah
okay
yeah
i got off my pace or my cordless phone hope its not going bad
oh
its going to bump me out
but i think he only spent the low twentys
so i dont know
really
i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something thats limited edition
i dont know
i think the demands gone all down a little bit
i think you can
the prices arent as high
and the $unc$miata was first introduced
and they werent really that bad though when they were introduced were they
wh-
yeah
the demand is so high that they were going to retail them around $unc$thirteen standard
and you get your options your looking at or $unc$fifteen
yeah
thats true
but people were buying them for $unc$nineteen and $unc$twenty
uh-huh
and they may have gone down a little bit
but i
theyre still pretty much in demand
i think theres another car coming in
its supposed to come out and compete with that $unc$miata
and i cant remember what i read about that
but so thats
i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular
so
yeah
it really is
but
have you seen the new $unc$dodge $unc$stealth the real nice $unc$one
yeah
yeah
and the $unc$mitsubishi $unc$three $unc$thousand $unc$g $unc$t is the same
yeah
yeah
the $unc$mitsubishi is real nice looking too
yeah
thats the same manufacturer
those are nice
so they just market them
right
right
but yeah
and those are supposed to be very performance power there is big time
the expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about $unc$seventeen $unc$thousand
but those are pretty stripped
and theres nothing
theres really
that ones just more for looks
it doesnt have really the performance that the expensive one does
yeah
but ive seen $unc$one of those
and its not that great because they really
i think theyre only around $unc$twenty-nine $unc$k
yeah
the-
they have better
its not quite as nice for a little bit less
yeah
yeah
theyre not really that bad
but i dont know
like i said its still not practical for me
i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think now theres no way i can do that
yeah
im being single
and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess ive been pretty happy
right
ive havent tried to upgrade myself right now
i could get something nice and upgrade
but im consulting right now
so
really
i just made my first job hop about $unc$eight months ago
so
what do you think about the $unc$peace $unc$corps or public service commitment
thats the first ive ever heard of it
i havent heard anything too much about it
i think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft
and people said young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service like the $unc$conservation $unc$corps back in the thirties or various other things of that sort
uh-huh
and it seems to me that its not a totally bad idea
but i dont quite see how theyd make it work
uh-huh
how would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in $unc$yosemite $unc$national $unc$park and who goes to $unc$saudi $unc$arabia
right
yeah
i
the
my first impression was it would be very good
i think it would be good for people to serve
but i dont know if it should be an option
it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the $unc$depression or coming out of the $unc$depression available for kids
and i think there are some available now where they are able to work
but making it a mandatory thing kind of
yeah
the difficulty would be in whether its voluntary or involuntary
right
and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
uh-huh
and some people would get military service
and some people would get civilian service like working in hospitals
this
i assume its the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the $unc$army
they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that
and if they re-
or farm work in $unc$world $unc$war $unc$one i remember reading about
uh-huh
and i suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
uh-huh
but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
uh-huh
it seems like youd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice
yeah
its a possibility
yeah
id much rather work in a hospital than to go war
and im sure most young men and women would
and so
i think that in the cases like that they had to be pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasnt something new just to keep out of going to war
uh-huh
it was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
uh-huh
that makes sense
and then you run into again the bureaucracy in running it
how you going to cover that many people because weve got a lot more people now than we did then
yeah
sure
and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something for their room and board
right
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend even if its the $unc$peace $unc$corps where they dont get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something
uh-huh
uh-huh
plus the training involved
yeah
yeah
that would be expensive in most cases
yeah
because
i had a lot of friends who went to the $unc$peace $unc$corps back in the mid sixties
uh-huh
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization
but on the other hand im not sure what the permanent value of it was
i dont know what we got for all the money
uh-huh
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then $unc$east $unc$pakistan is now $unc$bangladesh and to $unc$algeria and to $unc$southeast $unc$asia and lots of out-of-the-way places
uh-huh
but i dont know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
uh-huh
i know in
i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught $unc$christianity in $unc$japan
uh-huh
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me
it taught me not to be so self-centered and to think of others
uh-huh
but i dont know if i was doing it in different situation not a really religious background if i would get a lot out of it
i think i did because it emphasized that sort of thing
a lot of self evaluation
sure
and it was definitely voluntary too
they were not drafting you and sending you against your will
right
right
and im sure that would make a big difference too
youve got
yeah
what about a voluntary program
do you think that would be a good idea
like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for teenagers to go and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to clean up and that sort of thing
i dont know what organization its under
i dont know if its a government run or if its a private charity thats put it together
i dont either
but i know that that helps a lot with training and a lot of
yeah
out here in $unc$california theres a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous
and they dont have to be locked up go to these camps
and they do forestry work
uh-huh
they maintain trails
and they put up signs
and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
uh-huh
and that i know is run by the $unc$state
but there may be other things
im not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
yeah
how much benefit itll do them in the long run
its probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble
but whether its something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
right
especially if you take a child thats from the inner city and then put them in a middle of a park
if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them
thats true
good point
so that may not benefit them in the long run
yeah
but
yeah
im sorry
im going to have to go
but my other line is blinking
okay
thank you
but it was good to talk to you
you too
bye-bye
okay
okay
whats your most recent one that youve seen
what i do
i havent been to a movie theater in probably $unc$eight or $unc$nine months
uh-huh
so i havent really seen any movies in the movie theater
but i rent probably $unc$four or $unc$five movies a week
really
i used to do that too
but i havent been doing it lately
but
weve got a good video place out here
and gosh im just trying to think of all the movies ive recently seen
air $unc$america
no
see i havent seen that $unc$one
have you seen wild orchid
no
is it good
it depends
do you like steamy movies
no
not ye-
i know that sounds funny coming from a woman
but usually i dont
okay
what type of movies do you like
action
bu- d-
i guess $unc$two of my favorite movies is probably lethal weapon and lethal weapon $unc$two
okay
and those are $unc$two of my most favorite
theyre just really good movies
and i liked bird on a wire and movies like that
yeah
do you like suspense movies
or do you like just action
or
yeah
some i guess like
what do you mean
are you talking about movies like die hard $unc$two
jagged edge
okay
yeah
i liked that
that was pretty good
that was okay
i guess i thought it was too far fetched
but so many people said no it wasnt
but i guess
i hope i dont run across them
really
thats true because
i dont know
i just didnt find that one to be real
i just thought it was too far fetched
what was your favorite all time movie
gosh i cant think off my head
do you know which one yours was
i have to say that probably the $unc$one movie that really threw me back the most that i was really the most in shock with was probably star wars
yeah
thats
when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that
right
i guess out of all the movies ive never been as excited to go back
i was ready to go back and see it again
really
yeah
yeah
youre right about that
but thats really like an all time classic
i dont think anything could ever beat that
now i also liked gone with the wind or some of the classic like the $unc$lawrence of $unc$arabia
ive never seen that
you havent
no
should i rent it
yeah
should i go rent it tomorrow
no
thats a real interesting movie
and its got a good historical perspective to it
thats probably something i need to see right now because im taking history in school
yeah
i just saw a movie called the lost $unc$capone
and its about $unc$al capones brothers primarily $unc$one of his brothers
really
and i wont give the whole plot away
but its really a good movie
$unc$al $unc$capone had $unc$three brothers
uh-huh
and $unc$one of them was lost for many many years
and he turns out to be a law man
really
yeah
its really interesting
it
you just gave it away
i guess i cant go see it
no
no
thats okay
i didnt give away the whole thing
i just gave away just enough to get you interested
that does sound good
is it $unc$one
i guess its a rental
yeah
it is
okay
i may have to do that go see it
or go rent it
and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing all
yeah
ive seen all of $unc$james deans movies all of $unc$mae wests movies
uh-huh
and just kind of go out and rent all the movies and just kind of go
i guess you could do that get all of $unc$david carradines movies or $unc$segal
uh-huh
to
whats his first name
i cant remember his first name
its not $unc$david is it
is it $unc$david $unc$segal
i dont know
he was on $unc$arsenio just recently
i dont watch that
it was really kind of interesting because $unc$arsenio was asking him about what he thought of $unc$one of the other action guys
really
god i cant even remember the name
he said he wouldnt really talk about it
didnt want to talk about him because he didnt think he was such a good action guy
it wasnt $unc$stallone
it was
i cant remember
shoot i cant remember the guys name
but i like all the $unc$rambo movies
thats $unc$one side of the action i guess that i didnt really care for
but i dont really like $unc$sylvester $unc$stallone
yeah
i dont think hes really a very good actor
i know that sounds awful because so many people think hes so wonderful
but i just have never been a $unc$stallone fan
yo $unc$adrian
hey thats pretty good
no
i guess like i say
i dont know i just have never seen any interest in him
but
no
we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
oh
dont watch really very many horror films at all
yeah
i dont either
i dont know
theres something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something coming out of the t v that just doesnt make my day
yeah
youre right
its so
i guess im a realist and so when i watch movies like that its like this can not happen
so i just dont enjoy it because its just like come on give me a break
yeah
i just
and so many of them are done so poorly
yeah
it just doesnt even give you the effect
some of them are done good
and they do scare you
but so many of them are just done real
i dont know
im not really into those
i just saw a really interesting movie called $unc$flatliners
that was $unc$one of my favorites
yes
i thought that was a very good movie
yeah
i was really impressed with that one
what i liked about it was that it was a new subject
nobody had ever touched it before
yeah
and it was done so well
it was just
it was just crazy enough for th-
students might try to do it
and its not like theres a lot of scientific data on it
right
thats probably true
but it was a very good movie
it was done real well too
there wasnt any part of it that you really felt like no this cant happen
it seemed real
it was really good
yeah
that was $unc$one
its not my all time favorite movie
but it was good
it was really good
yeah
and i dont know if you like this kind
but i thought pretty woman was a really good movie too
yeah
that was a great movie
yeah
weve seen that $unc$two or $unc$three times
we waited
and we rented it
yeah
but it was really good
have you seen shrimp on the barby
no
i havent
i dont know if ive even heard of that one
yeah
its got
it must have whats his name in it
no
no
it doesnt
no
really
$unc$hogan
yeah
$unc$paul $unc$hogan
no
no
really
im surprised
no
its got $unc$cheech $unc$marin
really that must be pretty good then
was it good
yeah
it is
its kind of a poor mans pretty woman in reverse
oh
but it was kind of cute
did you see dirty rotten scoundrels
yes
yes
i though that was a really cute movie
i enjoyed that
yeah
it was
twins was good too
because when i thought of that i thought of
anyway
there was another one
whats the $unc$one that just
dances with wolves have you seen that yet
no
i havent
youve got to see that one
its really
i hear thats the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video
right
thats probably true
thats probably true
its very very good very good
yeah
thats another one that
i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it
my wife has got a picture from $unc$kevin $unc$costner
and he signed it
its from dances with wolves
really
yeah
and he signed it
he happens to be a friend of $unc$one of her business associates or not a friend a cousin
wow thats impressive
neat
but anyhow we got a nice picture
and it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves
so weve got to try to get out there and see that one
yeah
its really worth it
its a very good movie
and yes
i would suggest seeing it at the theater
i know that theyre still playing it
and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until $unc$august
i think because they were scheduling a video release of it in $unc$july
and then when it won all those awards they pushed it back to $unc$august
so but yeah
that one is definitely worth seeing
its really good
did you see driving $unc$miss $unc$daisy
yeah
and i didnt think that $unc$one was near as good
okay
i guess it was okay
it was all right
but when i compare the winners of this year and last year it just
i dont know
maybe its not
im pretty pro gun control over all
ive had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control
and i must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which i find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me i find use sort of canned arguments sort of the $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a slogan arguments
and ive been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it
i guess on a scale of $unc$one of $unc$ten im probably around a $unc$two in terms of fair restricting guns
and i have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste
i dont like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort
and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
me being from $unc$texas
uh-huh
i hope youre ready for this
ill give it a try
ive got my $unc$texan stereotypes in place
im not your stereotypical $unc$texan
i was raised around guns hunting
uh-huh
so i dont have a fear of fire arms in any respect
uh-huh
i respect them and what their capabilities are
uh-huh
and on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a $unc$green $unc$beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
uh-huh
its pretty power isnt it
and here in $unc$houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country
and here you go
here you
this will be border line $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a which i am not a member of
okay
okay
youve heard the slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
uh-huh
that applies to anything as well as guns
a gun
youve got
any of the big cities youve got the different rival gangs
and theyre having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
uh-huh
and they get out their little $unc$mac tens
they get out their little uzis
and theyre going to fight with them
and it doesnt matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class $unc$three firearm
if they want it theyll get it
i dont care if theyve got to go down into $unc$new $unc$mexico to get it
theyll get it
and theyll get across the border
my position although i have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon anyway
uh-huh
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony if i wanted to buy $unc$one i dont think there should be that big of a restriction on it
if they want to run a background check on me fine
if they want to put a $unc$seven day waiting period fine again
uh-huh
if they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that ive got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county thats fine too
uh-huh
uh-huh
what i dont gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldnt
you dont want to have someone making a personal trust in that way i would hope because someone
the personal sheriff doesnt get to have a gun
and someone the personal sheriff
the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon
is he a habitual trouble maker
are we picking him up every $unc$saturday for a drunk and disorderly
yeah
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems
just proving that youre basically a good citizen
but if youre not a basically good citizen
you just told me that youre going to get $unc$one of those guns anyway
if they want the firepower they can get it
so why hav-
because it doesnt matter how restrictive your border control points are
theyll get it across the border $unc$one way or the other
so why have any restrictions at all
okay
let-
go back to that $unc$one to $unc$ten scale where $unc$one being full gun control $unc$ten being none
uh-huh
yeah
id said about an $unc$eight
uh-huh
uh-huh
we could be
i said the restrictions i would like to see for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun
i would like to see them go through either
id like to see a law enforcement agency not $unc$n $unc$r $unc$a
but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun
you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the $unc$three basics
that makes a lot of since to me
i certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm
but i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon as a pistol
yeah
i have a bicycle
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because ive been run off the road and all sorts of things
im still puzzled though what is the argument
how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
whats the point of putting a restrictio-
basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway
theyre not going to take those courses
is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
theres
if its not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices
does that mean advantage
not necessarily a price thing
what is happening at least in this state
and i expect to see it in other states very soon
legislation been introduced that if a citizen of the state being myself has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
youre from $unc$california right
uh-huh
$unc$l $unc$a area
no
$unc$bay area
$unc$san $unc$francisco $unc$bay area
okay
okay
youve been to the city
uh-huh
and all these people come around
someone attempts to mug me i would ju-
i would
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me were equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade
uh-huh
if this legislation comes through
he pull-
im out with my family
uh-huh
weve gone shopping
were fixing to get in the car
this guy comes up
he pulls a blade on me
i can pull a gun on him now
and when youre looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
what if youre looking down the barrel of a hand cannon
then its still equally matched
having spent time in combat i feel it before theyll get the gun on me
i
yeah
if im at the same time
im sure
im sure given all your training im sure that youd
if i walk into a bad neighborhood im sure id want to walk through with you because im sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything
im quite concerned that if you let everyone
hasnt yet committed a felony
if you let them all walk around carrying guns
in this sort of wild west scenario youre going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature
youre going to start getting a lot of gunfire
its hard for me to imagine that take it to a logical extreme
if everyone walking around carrying a guns youre not going to have an increase in gunfire
its no-
its more of a police action in itself
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying im going to mug this guy right here
but hey hes carrying just as much firepower as i can
and if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public then this individual also knows this guys pretty good with it
uh-huh
whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not thats another trip
uh-huh
uh-huh
but
uh-huh
uh-huh
in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat even more so when it comes to my wife and son
uh-huh
yeah
anybody tries to hurt them i wont even blink
i know
no
i understand that
what if you think someones trying to hurt them and you make a mistake
this is where the question of gun control comes in
yeah
that was the topic
what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
uh-huh
say a person get
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
and say ive got the vibes this guys fixing to do something
i go ahead and pull my piece
uh-huh
and i make sure this persons sees it so that hes got now doubt that i will use it on him
and i will use it right then
uh-huh
if he doesnt back up at that point he deserves what he gets because i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family im going to dust you
as it stands now ive got to do that with a blade
and the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training ive had
uh-huh
uh-huh
as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because youre not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly
and
if im the one doing the shooting i dont miss
thats the kind of training ive had
okay
this is really ironic that i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
no
and its just been tearing me up all day
i bet
because we have just been looking all over for him
weve been to the pound
weve been to the humane society
weve been to the adoption center
weve just been all over the neighborhood
weve been calling neighbors
so this is just really strange
i guess so
have you lost him before
no
this is the first time
hes gotten out before
but hes always stayed right here
uh-huh
hes never gone away
and so this is just really strange because
what kind of a dog is he
hes part golden $unc$lab and part lets see $unc$alaskan no not $unc$alaskan
i always forget
yeah
$unc$australian shepherd
oh
boy hes a big one
hes pretty big
thats why it really surprises me that he hasnt come back because like i said hes never gone away like this before
and i would think he could get hurt by a car or something
i dont know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big
yeah
but i dont know
i hope he comes back
thats too bad
thanks
i do too
how long have you had him
about $unc$two years
so hes
thats tough
yeah
its really
gosh anyway
yeah
you get very attached to animals dont you
isnt that funny how we do
yeah
we just really
theyre always there for you
and they dont talk back to you
yeah
and its kind of pleasant
theyre companions
yeah
sure
sure
do you have any
yes
we have a dog a little white $unc$lhasa
and her name is $unc$angel
and we have a cat a white cat hes just a $unc$tabby just a
and his name is $unc$dominique
we call him $unc$neek
but
how do they get along together
pretty good
we had the dog first
and shes kind of a wimp
and the cat kind of rules
but she likes him all right
we had another cat about $unc$two years ago
it got feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep
and then we got this new cat
so i have $unc$two children
and they really enjoy the animals
and then my mother whos very elderly lives with us
and shes really good friends with the dog
theyre very good buddies
yeah
thats what are so neat about animals
theyre really companions
and theyre friends
thats right
you can love them all you want
and they love you right back
and they dont
thats right
they dont care what you look like or what you act like
no
they just love you unconditionally
i know
its wonderful
its just so neat
its
thats
i dont know
this is just so hard
i know it has to be
its like i said weve had him for $unc$two years
and hes never
hes gotten out
but hes always been right there
hes never been gone at all
uh-huh
uh-huh
hes just always been right there when he gets out
oh
its the first time hes ever been gone like this
thats really too bad
thats awful
i just knew today that we looked at the pound and that we just went all over the place
and i knew we were going to find him
and when we didnt it was like no
so i dont know
i hope youll find him
you most likely will
yeah
we keep
they told us at the $unc$humane $unc$society and the adoption center dont give up hope
have you put any posters up or anything like that
we were talking about that tonight since he just got out yesterday
we were just talking about that whether
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently
weve got so many when he was a puppy
uh-huh
yeah
but we just dont have a whole lot
we have him on film on the video camera
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
but you cant put that on the
no
you sure cant
so i dont know
dear
we will put some posters and stuff up
thats good
and hopefully that will help maybe around the neighborhood
but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood
so that helps too if they can keep
they can keep their eyes open
yeah
yeah
so
that will help
i think that if somebody else picks him up
i think that if he gets out hell come back
yeah
i really do because he knows exactly where he lives
so
yeah
yeah
he will
i bet he does
i know that its hard on you
i know that id be worried too
i know
its just so ironic that this would happen
and i would get this kind of a call
yeah
isnt it though
i know
thats
its very strange
but
i know sometimes our cat will stay out all night
and when hes not right at the door in the morning i really worry that somethings happened to him that hes got in a fight or somebodys hit him
and if he doesnt come by mid morning then i really get scared
but hes always come back eventually
so
thats good
thats $unc$one thing about cats though
theyre so small
yeah
and they can get hurt a lot easier
yeah
they can get hurt a lot easier
yeah
they can
so that would make you really tend to worry about them if theyre not right there
yeah
yeah
but hes a real feisty guy
he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesnt want them on our property
is that right
hes
cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are
they just really do not want other animals on their property
theyre very
he just
any cat that comes near and even a dog he wont jump at them or anything
but hell sit
and hell watch
and i think maybe he would if it came real close
but hes very protective of our property
huh
thats really
i guess i really dont know cats that well because my mother never liked them
uh-huh
so i never had them growing up
yeah
so i never really had them around me
so ive never owned $unc$one since i
theyre really a lot different than dogs because theyre very independent
and hes very affectionate when he wants to be
but if you want him to be and he doesnt want to be hell either scratch you or run away
but when he wants to be hes really affectionate
he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you
but if hes not in the mood youd better stay away from him
but dogs seem to be always in the mood
theyre always right there and like you to pet them and loving
yeah
thats true
i like the way they come up
and theyll put their head underneath your hand
yeah
yeah
that
and most dogs do that
yeah
they do
i dont know any that really dont
they know exactly how to get that attention
they sure do
they just come up
and they put your
yeah
or theyll rub their head against you
do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-
no
hes outside during the day
and then we get home at night we do bring him in
you have a fenced yard or
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
the backyard its really big too for him to run in and stuff
thats why we couldnt understand why he would want to get out because hes had all this room to run in
yeah
but
how did he get out
he dug a hole under the fence
boy
he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole
and we filled it back up put him back in there
uh-huh
he did it again
uh-huh
so we chained him up
uh-huh
but we really didnt want to keep him chained up because we feel like thats just too restricting for him
right
right
so we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it so that he couldnt get out
uh-huh
he kind of ripped through the chicken wire
oh
so i cant
i just have not
i dont understand because its like hes got a good home
hes got
we have $unc$two kids that just love him a lot
yeah
yeah
its like we cant understand why he kept wanting to get out
we just couldnt
you know that animals are like that
they like to roam and investigate and see whats going on
yeah
i guess thats
yeah
i guess thats probably true
i dont think its anything we did
no
least i hope not
no
im sure that
no
i know
he really does have a good home
i think thats what really bothers me the most about it
yeah
its like
how are your kids handling it
i dont know if its quite hit them
uh-huh
i have $unc$two girls
uh-huh
and they just been real
i dont know
at first they seemed to be upset
but now its like if he doesnt come home can we get another dog
yeah
that sounds like kids
its like wait a minute
oh
poor $unc$buddy
i said hes only been gone a day
and you already want to replace him
whats his name
did you call
$unc$buddy
$unc$buddy
uh-huh
thats was our cats name that died
is that right
yeah
we named him $unc$buddy after $unc$buddy $unc$bell the $unc$ranger baseball player that used to be here
oh
and we used to
we were really into that when we got him going to the $unc$ranger games
and we named him $unc$buddy $unc$beaner for some reason
but $unc$buddy after $unc$buddy $unc$bell
so
thats funny
but he was a good cat too
we miss him a lot
yeah
and i feel real guilty because we had him for $unc$six years
and $unc$one year i forgot to get him his leukemia booster
and he got it
oh
and i just felt so bad
its real contagious
and its
and the vet said it runs rampant in this area
i didnt know that
and if they dont have their booster any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically
they get it if the other cat has it
so
i had no idea
oh
i did not know that
oh
it was
i just felt terrible
i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was
he was just getting real skinny
okay
okay
the question was about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise
uh-huh
i dont do it as much as i should
i try to walk
uh-huh
and last year i did it every day
but in $unc$ninety-one ive kind of gone down hill
uh-huh
and so im not doing it as much as i need to
but i can tell you when i do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
i agree
but its just to get motivated to do it
and once i get started i do it every night
uh-huh
its just to get motivated again
and what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again
and i was walking
and it got kind of dark
uh-huh
and i was by myself
and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block
and so i kind of got frightened
and i kind of use that as an excuse
all i have to do is start earlier
but
right
i havent walked since
so
its always easy to find an excuse not to exercise
i know what you mean
yeah
it sure is
it sure is
how about you
do you exercise on a regular basis
i try to
i started at the beginning of this year
i decided all right im going to start exercising again
im going to be real good
and i went through the $unc$t $unc$i fitness center and registered for the aerobics classes there
uh-huh
and they run for $unc$two months at a time
and you do have to pay to take them
and i signed up for $unc$one that was $unc$three nights a week an hour and a half
so that was $unc$four and a half hours a week
oh
and it cost $unc$sixty dollars
and i thought okay thats not cheap
thatll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money
right
and i had a friend of mine going
so i was real good
i only missed it about $unc$three times
and then $unc$march came around
and i signed up again
and i got caught up with a class i was taking at $unc$t $unc$i
and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class
uh-huh
and then i went to $unc$colorado $unc$springs the next week to do some training at the $unc$t $unc$i up there
and so that was $unc$two weeks i had missed
and boy i tell you what ive been terrible ever since then
yeah
its once you get out of that habit you dont get back into it
uh-huh
because i teach school
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class
we went in together and hired a private instructor
and she came to our school twice a week
uh-huh
and i was
i would go faithfully
and then i missed once
then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again
uh-huh
i think you just have to stick with it
yeah
i think ive been $unc$two maybe $unc$three times the month of $unc$april
and this session is about to run out
i signed up for a different one now thats only $unc$two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes
and some of them require me to go out of town
uh-huh
and that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that
yeah
lately theres been nights that i could have gone
and ive found excuses things like i had the flu last week
yeah
but im fine this week
i could have gone $unc$monday
i could have gone tonight
and i didnt
yeah
so im kind of finding excuses
and now its kind of like
this is the last week
ill just start fresh next week
but i better do it
and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first $unc$two months wasnt the second $unc$two months
she started taking tennis lessons
and so i havent had that extra motivation of us encouraging each other to go
yeah
so
sure
yeah
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same thing
uh-huh
its misery loves company
i dont really love exercise
some i
the neighbor across the street she belongs to presidents
and its not presidents any more
i dont know what the name of it is anymore
but she loves it
uh-huh
its an automatic high for her
uh-huh
she just enjoys it so much
and i dont
yeah
im the same way
i feel good after i do it
but i hate it when im doing it
yeah
i just
i dont enjoy it at all
and she just loves it
so even when she doesnt go to the health club she runs
uh-huh
and its a daily thing for her
so it
and its so hard for me
i envy her
i wish i could be that way
but i dont
i do too
and i have an older sister that loves running too
and she runs all the time
but to me its every minutes agony
and i
in fact i dont run
i hate to run
uh-huh
when i walk ill take along a radio or something
and that helps pass the time
right
yeah
walking is kind of boring
i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood
and we used to try to get together
and i think now that the weathers getting nicer were going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking
theres a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its not as boring if you get several people
thats right
and you can kind of talk
and it makes it pass pretty quickly
and the aerobics isnt too boring
i kind of enjoy it when im doing it
its a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess
yeah
yeah
but i do have to make myself go
and of course while im doing it i feel pretty good
and after i get finished i feel great
its great afterwards
yeah
i can go in there
i can be
a $unc$friday afternoon when im tired its the end of the week and i just want to go home ill make myself go
and ill have headache and everything
and i get out
i dont have a headache any more
i feel great
and im just
its amazing how much better i feel
yeah
and then just in general i sleep a lot better
yeah
thats right
and i just feel much better
ive been kind of dragging the last few weeks
and i know if i would just get around to exercising id feel better
exactly
it does
it gives you energy
but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising
yeah
im too tired
or i have a headache
or
i just got over the flu
and im still kind of draggy
so i better not go
its kind of a vicious circle isnt it
yeah
it really is
yeah
i find too that i have more energy when i exercise
and its silly not to
but i dont know
its just a put off
i dont know why i dont do more
and i know that its good for my health
i know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
right
so youre not only doing something to keep yourself fit but youre probably prolonging your life
so
right
theres no reason that we shouldnt do it
but i dont know
its just hard to make yourself go
and i think $unc$one thing i dont like about aerobics is that after im finished its kind of late at night
and ive been sweaty
and it
i dont really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands
yeah
so it kind of kills the evening for doing errands
so i think a $unc$tuesday $unc$thursday might be a little bit better
yeah
of course i feel like once ive done it if im sweaty i might as well do an extra $unc$thirty minutes because youve already kind of shot your night
right
but so im kind of glad they have a longer class on $unc$thursday now that i can just kill $unc$two nights and get a reasonable amount of workout in
yeah
does it cost the same for just $unc$two nights or
no
its less expensive
thats good too
this $unc$one was only $unc$forty-five dollars
but im glad its not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more probably
yeah
yeah
since its more expensive i think okay you spent that much money youd better go
thats right
thats right
so hopefully
yeah
yeah
its right there
and they have a really nice facility at the $unc$t $unc$i
theyve got $unc$two different aerobics rooms
they have the mirrors
of course sometimes you dont like to see the mirrors on the wall
you dont like to see how you work
but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going
but
yeah
and then they hire private instructors
uh-huh
thats great
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms
and its a pretty nice setup
and of course its real convenient because it is right there at work
i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere id never make it
yeah
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot
uh-huh
yeah
i can see that would be easy
they make it as easy as they possibly can for you
yeah
do a lot of people take advantage of it
quite a few do
they have probably id say $unc$fifteen to $unc$twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running
and they have them anywhere from $unc$six in the morning
they have some during lunch hour that are shorter
and i guess guys can take advantage of that
for me i wouldnt have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again
yeah
but theres a lot more guys that do that one
uh-huh
and they have them in the evenings
they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that
so they have big variety
they even have some water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool
ive never done that one before
but
you have a pool there too
uh-huh
how nice
theyve got an olympic pool and basketball courts and sand volleyball
theyve got the full weight room and the locker rooms with a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and everything youd need just about
wow
it is a real nice facility
its also got a full inside basketball court
and i think theyre working on building a jogging track and some other things
but it is very nice
thats great
i just dont take as much advantage of it as i should
now to use
im just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing
but
does it cost money to exercise in the weight room or to go swimming
do you have to pay for that too
yeah
you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities
and its about $unc$eight dollars a month
thats not bad
no
not at all
huh-uh
pretty cheap
and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership
but i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what ive heard
i think so too
yeah
and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
hm
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
yeah
in fact the $unc$t i-ers families can come in on these things
ill let you go first
whats there to say
doesnt seem like its being carried out very well in my opinion
seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i dont see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody
yeah
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty
yeah
yeah
i know what you mean
i
in $unc$maryland they do have capital punishment
uh-huh
and ive seen a lot of people get sentenced
and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals
yeah
uh-huh
from what i underst-
i saw a statistic just a few days ago so far this year or was it during the last year during a years time i think it was they executed $unc$twenty-five people in the nation
meanwhile there were $unc$twenty-five $unc$hundred people on death row
so i
and its building up
theyre convicting them faster than theyre executing them
so its really building up
yeah
whats amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
uh-huh
and here in $unc$maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons
just
yeah
everybodys got that
yeah
but in
here its to the point where they were letting prisoners go commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people into the jails
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and it was just amazing to me
and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within $unc$five days of getting out and being rearrested an
yeah
isnt $unc$maryland where the famous $unc$willy $unc$horton case was
i cant remember
refresh my memory
that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the presidential race
it may not have been $unc$maryland
it may have been $unc$massachusetts
i dont remember
i dont remember myself
anyway the question is do you think it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime
or do you think it can if its done right
if they started executing them on a regular basis i think it might make a difference
right now i dont see it making a difference
if it
i dont see someone not going out there and committing murder because theyre afraid theyre going to get sentenced to death
most people out there committing murders dont care
uh-huh
they just dont care
yeah
i think in large measure the reason they dont care
its not because the punishment
but so many of the people that commit crimes dont get punished
yeah
the police dont catch them
or the courts dont convict them
or they dont serve very much of the time
and so their success rate is very high
crime does pay
you can make a good living at it
yeah
yeah
and theres a lot of people here in $unc$baltimore that have
and we just had a real big cocaine bust
and of course theyre playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very very small ring
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
yeah
but $unc$baltimore has an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year
i think theyve got over a $unc$hundred dead already this year
last year it was $unc$d $unc$c
i guess $unc$baltimore caught them
its kind of moved up
and you have to remember that theres i think $unc$x number of people out there that are going to commit murders
uh-huh
and once you kill off a few of them
yeah
if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder
yeah
the only consolation is so many of the murders are
the violent people going against each other
and so they
societys not going to put them to death
at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society
and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently
yeah
i personally think life imprisonment
i dont think much of life imprisonment first of all its never turns out to be life
but second why should we
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole
that means youre going to put them in a cage you think its never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again
then why bother
just execute them because that way youre sure theyll never ever going to walk the streets again
yeah
so anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole id say give them the death penalty
so
yeah
it makes sense
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but so few and far between
makes good t v movies
and thats about it
yeah
and also the thing i dont like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that its not based on what is true and what is false
but rather its on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell
yeah
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are
yeah
and that way we can be sure
we can find out the truth
we can find out what really happened and base the sentence on what the person did not on what were allowed to let the jury hear
yeah
i had
my father-in-law participated in a jury trial
he was actually on the jury
uh-huh
and this man was accused of killing i think it was $unc$two people and shooting a policeman point blank in the face
of course he didnt die
uh-huh
and this was during a holdup of a restaurant
and it came out during the trial that they had tried to rob another place
and when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple jumbo cookies
and so they were so upset from robbing this guy trying to do this holdup that didnt work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started shooting people
just started shooting people because they botched the first job
you know its
and so now theyre going to get even
yeah
yeah
and get even with who
yeah
you know stupid guys
and it turned out that the policeman survived to the point that he was able to identify the guy
uh-huh
and of course they tried to make the cop look like he was a no good rotten drunk
yeah
it was amazing
what was the verdict
what was the results there
he was found guilty
yeah
oh
he
last i heard he beat a push for the death penalty
whether they finally got it or not i dont know
uh-huh
i kind of stopped listening after a while
uh-huh
he would come home
and after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on
and of course then they had to go back to dec-
after he had to go
the penalty phase
yeah
theyve decide the penalty separately from the verdict
right
and everybody was pretty much lets burn him
uh-huh
and thats the way they wanted to do it
and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he
some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
but when it all came down they just within an hour decided the mans fate
yeah
you just have to decide wha- yo-
theres really $unc$two separate decisions there i guess
$unc$one is did it really happen the way the prosecutor said it happened
is this man really guilty
and you have to decide that
but then you have to decide as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing
yeah
and that w-
ive never been on a jury
ive never had that experience
im not sure id look forward to making that kind of decision about a mans life
yeah
yeah
it went pretty quick from what he said
uh-huh
but theres a lot of other crimes out there besides murder
i think if youre dealing drugs caught more than twice or something theres a death penalty associated with it
uh-huh
yeah
the thing id be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence
ye-
i can handle people selling drugs
its wrong
but its not worth somebody getting executed for
but we hear so much about the violence and how its not safe to walk the streets these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing
uh-huh
and the people id most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life
that
you never know when theyre going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesnt really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not
yeah
yeah
i agree
and so i go le-
these are the kind of people i would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say we dont accept your kind in our society
yeah
i agree
i have a low tolerance for that kind of person
and as far as
there are some other crimes that i think
kidnapping when they
kidnapping $unc$per $unc$se has a certain fine and penalty associated with it
uh-huh
but some of these people are just out and out brutal
i
some of the cases ive heard about over the years
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i make a fair amount of money
and the taxes that i pay i guess as a general statement i feel i guess i get my moneys worth for
okay
im not sure though whether i feel
i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas isnt correct
im sure that probably every person in this country would agree with you on that because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go
i
lately i guess or at least for the last $unc$twenty years or so ive felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost defense items at least in the last $unc$ten years have been
theres been and extraordinary amount of money spent there
and im not really sure that weve gotten our moneys worth there regardless of the outcome of the $unc$desert $unc$shield situations
uh-huh
yeah
i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature ive found that theres an extraordinary amount of waste
i take that as a given in any military operation
and
yeah
no argument here
yeah
and i gue-
i should imagine that what the problem
why im a little concerned about today is that this i dont know i shouldnt say easy rather quick victory in the $unc$mideast over the $unc$iraqis might lead us into a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe
i dont know what other foe that would be
but im just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
yeah
of course a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war
and the inventorys going to have to be restocked
on
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
and $unc$one of the things we were told is they had $unc$eleven $unc$thousand $unc$harm missiles which $unc$t $unc$i is the sole supplier for
and they used up $unc$two $unc$thousand of them in the war
so theyre going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed
yeah
but it
would that be
lets see
$unc$two $unc$thousand out of $unc$eleven $unc$thousand thats about a little over $unc$twenty per cent
i should imagine that that would be to keep it at those levels i guess that were originally appropriated when the $unc$soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one
i dont think theres very much of a threat there today
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there and whos controlling them
but
thats true
thats true
i dont know what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything that would be irrational
of course now we used up $unc$twenty per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks
right
yeah
and $unc$t $unc$i also makes the missile which was the t v laser guided bombs
yeah
and a big percentage of that was expended as well
that was just a matter of
what is the name of that
its called $unc$paveway
yes
yes
and a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
so those are $unc$two areas in which $unc$t $unc$i stands to gain some short term business to restock that
yeah
what im
i guess it
concerned about
talking about the taxes in general and that was an area that i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that were taxed for in the area of defense
or perhaps we have paid too much there
i dont know
it just seems to me that over the years now the
and its a cliche
i
but i see it myself
i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways
no doubt
i dont know
im familiar with some upbeat school areas
so i dont totally agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there
but i guess overall because i guess im not associated with what ghetto schools and rural school systems are like i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
yeah
as a matter of fact in $unc$texas weve had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge
and they
and the legislature just passed what they called a $unc$robin $unc$hood $unc$bill which
basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent
uh-huh
they dont have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
or is it all funded out of local taxes
okay
to give you some perspective this town that i had lived in for sometime in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-three was funded $unc$sixty-five per cent by state funds
yeah
then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this
but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it
and they dumped it all on the local school districts
so
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now
really
yeah
so what ended up happening was a shift
we went to $unc$sixty-five per cent state funding to $unc$sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of $unc$four years and
complete
its all shifted to local districts
and now even the money thats been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state
thats right
and i have no problem with a certain minimum level thats a standard that everybody ought to be able to have
yeah
but i am opposed to any attempts to restrict local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum
yes
i see what youre saying
i guess i am a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education
by that i mean im a product myself
i have a background of getting my college education through the $unc$g $unc$i $unc$bill
so did i
my $unc$masters anyway
what
but when i look at it to me it doesnt really make any difference
it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldnt have done
i dont think i would have gone on unless i had that financial easement made possible
yeah
thats right
and i dont really care what it takes to qualify whether youre a veteran or whether you
i dont even know if you have to perform community service
or unless you promise to even do something in the future i think that the subsidy itself
or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who i think i perceive the fact
uh-huh
at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their budget
i know in the state of $unc$florida just today the legislature adjourned
and they had completed a $unc$fifteen per cent increase in the state land grant colleges which isnt
to me it doesnt sound like a lot of money
but i guess it would be for $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred dollars a year
uh-huh
they went from $unc$eleven to $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred
yeah
and for an out of state student the tuition went up $unc$twenty-five per cent
i dont know what that would be
yeah
they had to raise community college taxes here a few years ago
but i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government was expending so much money on defense that the program now is
fees that fund these things i guess thats trickled down to the states
and the states dont have enough money
uh-huh
so they must charge fees
im not too sure of that reasoning
yeah
but i guess to get back to the main topic i dont know whether i pay too much taxes
i travel extensively in $unc$europe and see enormous
people pay a great deal in taxes
they tell me when i sit and talk to people
there they tell me they
some states they pay
in $unc$germany or in $unc$england in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to $unc$fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes
i can believe that
but im not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of
now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels
yeah
yeah
im not sure that im not up fairly close to that
i guarantee youd be paying a lot more in taxes if the $unc$democrats had more say
you really think so
yeah
i really do
but whats happened here is
i feel that in the last $unc$ten years my taxes have gone up
they havent gone down
i pay quite a bit more taxes
yeah
and
everybody is
but thats been a $unc$republican government for the last $unc$ten years
what theyve been able to do is slow down the rate of increase to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious
i
yeah
this has been really interesting
and ive enjoyed our talk
okay
i guess i just push something here
push $unc$one again right
no
we just say good-bye
and thats it
just hang up
okay
$unc$don good talking with you
nice talking with you too
bye-bye
bye-bye
i think life
i grew up on a farm
i dont
what kind
did you grow up in the farm
i grew up in
at that time i was in a $unc$trenton $unc$new $unc$jersey
and it was a suburb of $unc$trenton
so i really had mixture of suburb and urban living
uh-huh
yeah
i think though it was much slower and much more self-contained
i think youre right
its interesting
i work in a high school
uh-huh
so im comparing my life when i was in high school $unc$thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
yes
and the pressures on the children
you hear this as an excuse
but its true they are so much greater
unreal by comparison
i cannot believe what theyre doing academically the demands on them
and i can see why children do drop out
yeah
i think thats right
i can see the
i can remember as a child nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
uh-huh
uh-huh
it didnt occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
they were
and you didnt have to lock your door
no
no
and a lo-
some of these are urban worries
but its a lot different all though i guess $unc$twenty years a go now in this area things were similar because $unc$twenty years ago
lets see
it was after
its not all that long ago is it
$unc$twenty-five years ago is when we had the $unc$washington riots
uh-huh
uh-huh
the first rights weve been having some problem now
and it reminded me of that
yeah
we were living in $unc$new $unc$jersey $unc$twenty years ago
uh-huh
whereabouts
in $unc$allendale
uh-huh
and i use to have to go over to $unc$patterson when those riots were going on sometimes
uh-huh
i dont know though
its kind of hard to really know because of
though the news media had those riots kind of blown up out of proportion
uh-huh
because i went there many times
and
the $unc$washington riots werent
because
the $unc$washington riots werent
because i lived right downtown $unc$washington
and what you saw was what you got
im telling you
thats what
yeah
yeah
but it is interesting
theyre so many mor-
theyre different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures
the pressures of drug is so much
the prevalence is so much greater
uh-huh
the kinds of diseases that youve got out the
uh-huh
the consequences is
so much of whats going on is so much more serious then when we were younger
i think thats true
i think thats true
i think the other thing is that we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when im number $unc$one and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
uh-huh
uh-huh
and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and support for young people the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things
yes
and
if you dont have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you then its very difficult to have anything to turn to when youve got something facing you like that
uh-huh
thats true
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents children who will lie and cheat
and you approach their parents
and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to
uh-huh
theyre constantly excusing their child
right
and you can see exactly why the child is that way
yeah
exactly
you as a teacher cant hold a child accountable if youre not going to get reinforced by that at home
yeah
thats right
thats right
and you cant make up in a classroom of $unc$one hour a day whats not been done for $unc$fifteen or $unc$sixteen years at home
no
thats right
oh
and you get mixed signals
so its not always the schools systems
i think a lot of
no
theres so much more then that
it starts very much deeper then that
yeah
i think that too
i see some flickers of good directions turning
no
but whether theyre soon enough and fast enough i dont know
its just
of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways
the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now
right
with farming being so mechanized people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely
uh-huh
factory jobs are so much more sophisticated
yeah
thats right
and the kinds of knowledge that
its requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
and some people just dont have it
right
and theres so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
and you worry when the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children
yeah
thats just another
in terms of what its going to mean to a society in the future its a
yeah
some ways its rather frightening
it really is
it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of the jobs that is out there to be done in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be
it certainly is
it sure is
it sure is
not that i really think that they were perfect $unc$ten $unc$twenty or $unc$thirty years ago
but
it was a little easier though wasnt it
yeah
just the volume makes a big difference
yes
as mother i use to think sometimes its not so much the kids
its just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and everything
right
i look at my mothers life
she didnt work
for a long time when i was very young she didnt drive
she learned to drive i think when i was a teenager
and her life was a lot simpler
right and childrens lives were simpler because mother was there
and i sit here
somebody was there
thats right
and when theres nobody there
thats right
thats right
i always thought too that people worrying about going to work when their children are little
and i think thats sad if they have to because they miss so much
but i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go work was when they were teenagers
they need you more as a teenager
isnt that true
thats why im working in a school system so that im home when theyre home
right
its not so much that they come to you every minute
but its that you are there when they need you
thats exac-
isnt that
thats so true
yeah
i find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
yeah
and it keeps me from being the old fogy
but at the same time it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes
yes
i think thats true
as to whats com-
but thats the same
im home in the summers
im home with the holidays
yeah
thats
im home at $unc$three o clock when the children are at home
or where home
yeah
$unc$one is now a senior in high school and the others in college
and
but that helps a lot
it does
i have a daughter who just had a second job
she needed to work
and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her and looked a long time before she found $unc$one that was laid back enough so she would be able to interact with them
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
and so i
good kind of experience as well
but
i
i think thats really important
i dont think people realize how important it is
that is so true
yeah
and its not that the children always say something
but every once in awhile theyll come up and make a comment
yeah
and you realize its important that
and yet we have to make that choice
i think $unc$twenty $unc$thirty years ago a lot of women just didnt have to make that choice
yeah
i think thats right
what was your name again
i
$unc$linda $unc$lee
$unc$linda
uh-huh
okay
and your name was
i think probably that weve just about
i enjoyed talking with you
im going to change the world
but
i enjoyed talking with you
yes
its nice talking to you too
okay
bye now
bye-bye
there we are
yes
tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up
when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort
and i had $unc$two boys
uh-huh
they were both interested in things like model rockets
so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
i have $unc$two boys also
my children are swimmers
and so as they were growing up much of our normal life outside of school and everything revolved around their swimming
uh-huh
so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too
so we were always together at their meets
thats good
mine were not terribly sporting
uh-huh
they both did t-ball and soccer in grade school
uh-huh
but neither one of them carried on the sports after that
yeah
the boys tried those
but they did go in
they started swimming when they were $unc$seven and $unc$eight
and they really loved it
and theyre swimming both c-
theyll be
$unc$one is in college also swims in college
and the other will continue to swim in college
and theyre fortunate
they even made nationals
wonderful!
thats great!
and so we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close
but we did a lot of things
and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children
yeah
i
we live near $unc$washington
so we would always go in for the museums
sure
thats always a big thing
and $unc$one of my children is also a musician
so $unc$one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go either my husband or i or both of us would t- concerts with him
uh-huh
and my other child is big into tropical fish
so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit or go to fish shows
so
my goodness
we didnt have any avid activities like that
they were interested in a lot of things
but nothing to quite that depth i guess
but we would
i dont think weve missed a fish store on the entire northeast coast of the $unc$united $unc$states
my goodness
we did go to things like aquariums and natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids
uh-huh
yes
in fact its funny
our vacations have always been as theyve gotten older
when they were younger we would go to the beach
but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a feature each day whether it would be going to
uh-huh
yes
$unc$one summer we went up to $unc$new $unc$england
and we went to the marble quarries up there to see that and another day fish hatchery
really
and so we did try
yeah
and of course we learned too
yeah
and i dont know
i
when they were very young i did not work
yeah
i started working half-time when they were at the nursery school
uh-huh
but i
yet
and i started working part-time when they were in junior high school and high school
now and i worked in the school system
and now i work a full school day
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
uh-huh
so it was a
i think they need me more when they were older than they did when they were
yeah
i think they need you in different ways
thats true
yeah
you want to be around for the crisis and things like that
but its not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making
thats right
yeah
thats for sure
thats for sure
do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
it lo-
o-
the $unc$one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons
uh-huh
and i dont think it needs to be the mothers
but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours
yeah
when they
it was funny
i can remember
and my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school
it wasnt really conversation
but there were always things that just tumbled out
yes
and granted the child doesnt always think that theyre sharing it
but it
when its not there they miss it
i think thats true
but i also think thats at least in my experience truer of girls than boys
uh-huh
even when i was there my boys didnt share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother
yeah
yeah
no
i realize that
but its funny
they dont always do it
but occasionally they do
and you want
yeah
uh-huh
and when they do theres a reason for it that theyre sharing it
uh-huh
and ive wanted to be available when for some reason they were bouncing something off of me because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about
right
and it was
you just felt gee if i werent here how
uh-huh
or if my husband
who would they ask
thats right
or what would they do
yes
thats exactly right
but its been interesting particularly i think because the society in which we live families are separated
you dont have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles
uh-huh
i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
yeah
i did too
we were close to my maternal grandparents just a few miles and close enough to visit my paternal grandparents quite often
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
they were $unc$fifty miles away
but
and were
that
i grew up with
every weekend there was some visiting somewhere
uh-huh
and it was sort of an italian family
but my children
although we have some relatives in the area that we see we
they dont ha-
its not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
right
when my kids were quite small we lived close to both sets of grandparents
uh-huh
and they saw them a lot
but they dont have any cousins
or they didnt
yeah
their cousins are about $unc$ten years younger
uh-huh
so they never played together or anything
yeah
and there are only $unc$two of them
and they didnt live in the same town
that
the trend of families and time
where parents are spending less time you dont have the families to take up the gap
thats right
and so the kids in some ways are suffering a little bit in that the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up
yeah
uh-huh
so we try to do it as well as we can
we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
uh-huh
and cousins and aunts and uncles
and we do
but although its not the same we are
and thats part of i think teaching too is what a family is like
because then how do they pattern their own
everyone makes its own model
but it seems that there should be some continuity
yeah
and its helpful to have things that become family traditions and that sort of thing
thats
yeah
we have had this tradition that we always go out before $unc$christmas and cut our own tree
uh-huh
and thats always been a little bit of a tradition that weve had
now this year its was hard with our son now being in college
yeah
so this was $unc$one thing that we werent able to do this year
but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until our older son went away to college
thats the kind of thing that they will remember though
and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came to
uh-huh
ours finally disintegrated
oh
we had a felt one that was li-
it was a $unc$christmas tree that had a little trinket for each day that was pinned on the date
yes
thats
uh-huh
and then you took it off and put it on the tree
so at the end you had a decorated tree
ours is
a friend of mine from $unc$denmark hand appliqu3ed $unc$one for each child
and it finally got moth-eaten
we threw it way last year
how nice
and they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us
and theres a ring
and you buy a present
i see
and you wrap the present up
and the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of $unc$band-aids and an eraser and things
how cute
today where sometimes i put a little gift occasionally a $unc$christmas tree decoration which they will save for their future to sometimes just money pieces of candy
uh-huh
yeah
so i think as theyre getting in college i just
for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day which was the equivalent
im sure he appreciated that!
it was the equivalent of a $unc$christmas present
uh-huh
and it was fun
but thats a tradition
and those will be passed on to them when they get married and leave
yeah
you were saying what other trends are there
and $unc$one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently
uh-huh
and that is the trend in a lot of lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
yes
yes
and thats
a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
the b-
yes
and the broken families
as i said living in an area of $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c we definitely see this
uh-huh
and its that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising children from the streets too frequently
right
we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on multigeneration matriarchies where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while shes still living at home with the mother
uh-huh
uh-huh
and
yes
this is a si-
this is in fact
weve been studying this in our school that or not the symptoms
its $unc$one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing
its a rite of passage
yeah
h-
$unc$myrna how do you get your news
most of it is from the radio and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon
uh-huh
yeah
we usually watch the local news and the national news both
uh-huh
yeah
im pretty much the same
i find that
im a graduate student
and i read a lot for school
and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because im reading so much all the time
and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast
you can always get up and leave that
uh-huh
thats true
i just dont seem to have time to sit down and read the paper
either
by the time i get home from work its already time for the news to come on
uh-huh
thats right
yeah
so its so much easier to sit there
and besides i can be doing other things and still listen to the news
yeah
thats right
i agree
thats
a lot of times i eat while im watching the news
yeah
yeah
the same thing
is there any
what did you think about the coverage over in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf
i think they did a great job
yeah
i thought so too
it
for a while when we were really interested we saw it all the time
some of the stations i guess carried it for $unc$twenty-four hours for a couple of days there
and then the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good
uh-huh
yeah
and you could always find some channel that had something on
but you didnt necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time
yeah
right
yeah
just news
thats right
yeah
yeah
i noticed that $unc$one thing that $unc$t $unc$i did they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings
uh-huh
and they used to have a program called $unc$t $unc$news and just updates of different things that were going on within $unc$t $unc$i
when all the mess in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf came about they started carrying $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
yeah
now they have had so much good response from this that $unc$t $unc$i now has $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n on all the time
uh-huh
thats great
so we can always run upstairs and get a quickie update on whats going on if we really want to
uh-huh
yeah
or if you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats really good
ive found that i dont have cable television anymore when i went back to graduate school i just didnt have the money to rent a cable t v line or whatever
so i dont get $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n which was a big disappointment
i used to watch
that was my
if i wasnt home
im a college teacher
and sometimes i teach in the evening
so ill miss the evening news
and you could always catch a good news program at $unc$eight oclock or $unc$nine oclock on $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
i think that really has changed the way i look at the news
yes
yeah
we dont get it either
we live out in the country
uh-huh
and we just dont have it available out there where we are
but when we did have it thats what we usually watched was $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
uh-huh
and sometimes wed watch the weather stations
yeah
thats same
yeah
thats
when i had it i watched it religiously for half an hour
and then you could go on to do what else you wanted to do
yeah
yeah
i find i read very little
i dont even get a regular newspaper and because i dont drive that much
i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work
i find i spend so little time in the car that i dont really listen to the radio
i dont
so television is my main new source
i get that too because im in a van pool
uh-huh
and im in the van $unc$two hours a day
an
really
to commute to work
yes
yes
oh
and in the morning i try to sleep because its dark $unc$thirty
but in the afternoon i try to read
so i can not pay attention to what our driver is doing
yeah
i can
the van pools i know that
and im in the $unc$baltimore $unc$washington area
and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas
but if you want a nicer home beyond the suburbs
i
thats necessary
yeah
yeah
are you in $unc$baltimore itself
i am right outside $unc$baltimore
i am less than a mile from the $unc$baltimore line
and i go to a campus of the $unc$university of $unc$maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
so im actually in $unc$baltimore
yeah
you could say im in $unc$baltimore
yeah
i have $unc$two kids over there
really
in $unc$baltimore
no
in $unc$d $unc$c area
uh-huh
yeah
$unc$one works for the $unc$state $unc$department
and her husband is in the $unc$navy
and hes stationed at $unc$bethesda
an
uh-huh
thats a really nice area $unc$bethesda area
uh-huh
uh-huh
its funny
theres a big difference between $unc$baltimore and $unc$washington even though theyre so close
theres only an hour less than that between the $unc$two
but there is a big difference in things like property values
and the closer you get to $unc$d $unc$c the more expensive it is
uh-huh
and the different slant
$unc$washington it really is an international city where $unc$baltimore is hometown $unc$baltimore
theres really
most people have relocated to the $unc$washington area
no
id rather have $unc$baltimore with the home town atmosphere
yeah
thats
i like it a little bit better too
its interesting though to meet different populations
being from $unc$pittsburgh originally im just now meeting different populations like $unc$chinese students and things
and i find that really interesting to imagine
here is somebody that was in $unc$china $unc$two years ago when all that was going on in $unc$beijing
thats an interesting perspective
but i really
much like the hometown area
yeah
and i think that also goes
its funny
you can watch different news
i can watch $unc$washington news or $unc$baltimore news
and i really do watch $unc$baltimore news
that really makes
i dont really bother with the $unc$washington station because its so far removed from what im interested in
most of what theyre talking about in $unc$washington is the crime problems that theyre having there
uh-huh
yeah
it was just a big thing recently
theyve had some terrible problems with $unc$hispanics
they had to impose a curfew in $unc$two of the areas in the $unc$washington suburbs
the mayor
theyve gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then brought in
uh-huh
i heard about that
yeah
and then came a woman thats
shes big in the democratic party
so thats good
so she has good national ties
but she also was something like a state auditor or something like that before this position
she was a state auditor
i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the $unc$district of $unc$columbia at $unc$washington
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party
and now she ran for mayor
so fiscally shes pretty tight and shes cleaning house
and it looks like hopefully shell do a nice job for $unc$washington which is
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there
from what i pick up on the news its a difficult process to get rid of a bad mayor
yeah
i know both of my kids didnt want to live anywhere around the downtown areas
right
they both moved way out
uh-huh
yeah
i think $unc$one of them lives in $unc$germantown
and i cant remember where the other $unc$one lives
yeah
but $unc$germantown is a nice area
$unc$uh-huh
yeah
its a nice area
its means they have to drive a little bit
but
yeah
they might be car pooling too
do they car pool in
are they driven by themselves
now i think he carpools
uh-huh
because hes got fairly regular hours since he came back
but now they have probably been carpooling together in fact
because she had been called back up active duty
uh-huh
yeah
and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last $unc$friday
so i havent talked to them this weekend
i dont know what the situation is
but she was
uh-huh
they didnt call you for mothers day
we were gone
you werent home
d-
no
we werent home
but she had called and left a message on our recorder
but i had that from all my kids except for $unc$one
yeah
thats good
i guess we should stop now
i thank you for calling
i have enjoyed it
uh-huh
good
i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the $unc$united $unc$states
yeah
so do i
ive become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever
i really enjoyed it
its so funny when you live in $unc$one part of the country you only see that perspective
its interesting to see the wider world
so i enjoy it
hey thanks a lot and bye
thank you
bye bye
okay
i do not know
how big a city is $unc$rome
you have heard about $unc$dallas
and the crime here is pretty bad
$unc$rome is pretty small
but
yeah
i was going to say
we hear a lot about $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city
uh-huh
there is a lot of crime down there
and i am afraid to go down there because you hear about people getting mugged
you leave your car for $unc$ten minutes
and it is stripped when you come back
yeah
have you ever been there
no
i have not
only to the airport
that is probably enough to see
are you in college right now
no
i work for the $unc$air $unc$force
okay
so there is a base up here
and
are base
thats interesting concept
are bases safe you know
bases are pretty safe because they check your i d on your way in
and
yeah
they minimize the access
right
but even so we had a
at $unc$new $unc$years we had some people come in and attack $unc$one of the planes because they were protesting the presence over in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf
uh-huh
no
sure
great
that is wonderful
yeah
$unc$dallas
we lived in $unc$minneapolis
we moved here about $unc$ten months ago
and $unc$dallas is pretty
we live in north $unc$dallas which is near a suburb called $unc$plano
so we are out of the city
but it is bad everywhere in terms of the handgun situation the number of rapes the number of muggings
just i would not say it is not as bad as $unc$new $unc$york
but it is pretty scary
yeah
people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods
and
yeah
they call them ornamental grates
but they are still bars
that makes it bad for getting out during a fire
yeah
it really does
and if you are a little bit claustrophobic
but i do not know
the jails are crowded
i am not a criminal justice specialist
so i do not know what can be done
i am
i do not know
it seems to
i think it is getting worse because i keep hearing things
like when i went home
my parents live in $unc$boston
uh-huh
but i went home
and we were watching t v
yeah
and this thing came on where a group of $unc$five or $unc$six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them
oh
and it was really disgusting
and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now
and you he-
were they teenagers
or
like that girl in $unc$new $unc$york that got beat up when she was jogging in $unc$central $unc$park a couple of years ago
yeah
yeah
i think they were early twenties
yeah
they were young men
yeah
so they werent
and were they obviously poor or depri-
that is really stra-
i say s-
i know it
how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder
those are a $unc$thousand bucks
yeah
unless they stole it
and that is $unc$one big thing down here
they have
and they are not all young
they are $unc$eighteen to $unc$twenty-four some of the young men and women
but you can see the $unc$crime $unc$stoppers ads on television
and they are
sometimes it is the same people that have been observed
and they still cant catch them
yeah
and you are wondering how we lived in $unc$minneapolis and $unc$wisconsin
there was all kind of
i know it is getting worse
i do not know what the world is or is not
the dimi-
in a small town in $unc$wisconsin near madison a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun and killed his parents and his $unc$three brothers and sisters
uh-huh
and the child had
and they said that he was $unc$twelve years old
and he had not displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever
yeah
and you are thinking to yourself
i wonder where
i know
i do not know
i wonder where he gets it
you must
i think t v is bad because they show all sorts of violence on
that
and i do not think a lot of parents
i do not know how it is in the $unc$air $unc$force base
but i just do not think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work
i just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more
yeah
they do not talk to their kids and take them out
and are not there all the time
so the kids are off to their own devices a lot
right
and discipline
i do not know how your folks were
but i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that my parents were the superior
and i was the subordinate
and it was sort of like there were boundaries
definitely
and i do not know i think today a lot of parents are ruled by their kids
i
i think so definitely
when you go to a restaurant and kids are running all over the place they
yeah
right
they are not learning boundaries
i see it in work place too sometimes
i do not know how old you are
but you sound a little bit younger than me
but i am in my thirties
and i see even people that work with me that are $unc$ten years younger
that they kind of have an attitude that i hate to say it
but thats just what it is
it is an attitude like the world owes them something
yep
but they
right
i see that too in the $unc$air $unc$force
espec-
do you
yeah
a lot of
especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work
are you in the $unc$air $unc$force
i am in the $unc$air $unc$force
yes
okay
and so people outside the $unc$air $unc$force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
sure
and so all the young engineers are i am just going
huh
get it for all it is worth
and that
right
and i am like you are the one who signed up
if you did not want to do it
and
right
right
and the $unc$air $unc$force is $unc$one of the better military experiences
yep
it is
i like it a lot
pardon me
i like it so far
that is
are you going to be a career person
im digressing
but i do not talk to many people in the military
oh
so i am
probably not
but they pay for my college
so
that is the way to do it
and thats
at least the $unc$air $unc$force is
i do not know i am nervous in $unc$dallas
i go to an aerobics class or something
and $unc$seventy women in a $unc$jazzercise class in a public parks and rec building
and you are supposed to feel safe
but then there are all these
does not matter race
but it is an inter racial mix
and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards
yeah
and i do not even think that way
but you just
nobody can think that it cant happen to them
it
no matter who they are
or where they are at
yeah
and you never know who is watching either
did you
i do not know i was in the grocery store this morning
we went to $unc$new $unc$orleans for $unc$four days and came back late last night driving
and it is about $unc$seven hours
huh-uh
and that is a very
we had never been there
that is a very very neat town to visit in terms of the $unc$french $unc$quarter and all of the things you hear about
uh-huh
right
but the crime is so bad there
in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do
how to carry your wallet
uh-huh
this is $unc$new $unc$orleans
$unc$new $unc$orleans
yeah
i would hate to be there during $unc$mardi $unc$gras
let me tell
i would never
yeah
you just do not
do not even bother
it is not worth it
when we came back i do not know if you have seen
i was in the super market this morning
and on the cover of $unc$time magazine there is a girl she is in $unc$boston
she is on the east coast somewhere
real attractive young girl
college freshman college coed
i think she is a freshman
she had been dating a fellow for several weeks
uh-huh
they went back to her dorm room
uh-huh
and date rape
and it just
she looked anguished
it was really just sad
did not pick it up and read it
but i should have
but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
i know
i do not
yeah
you cant trust anybody
i do not have any cure
it is really scary
no
you really cant
we lease out a really nice $unc$two story town home in north $unc$dallas
and they have a real big thing here
even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting everybody wants your business kind of thing
right
and my husband is the kind of guy hes sometime
he was raised on a farm in southern $unc$ohio near $unc$dayton
and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that
i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts
right
we
and he opened the door
i came downstairs
and i was real upset
and i probably got more nasty than i should have
but i just said $unc$howard
uh-huh
my $unc$god
i would not
you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away
yeah
and it is not a reason
i have been to $unc$new $unc$york
you should not deny yourself going to visit and all that
uh-huh
but it is not any worse
i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by
are you from $unc$boston
yeah
$unc$home $unc$owners $unc$savings and $unc$loan in $unc$boston
uh-huh
and i know i never felt
i have been to downtown $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city
and i have been to downtown $unc$boston
and i never felt any safer on $unc$milk $unc$street in $unc$boston staying at the $unc$meridian
i did not pay for
but i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city i have been in
right
right
so i would say $unc$one thing
do not deny yourself the $unc$new $unc$york experience but go with people that you know
yeah
i would not want to go by myself
no
but i do not know
i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals
i think the handgun
i am not real big on guns myself
uh-huh
so
i think our justice system needs to be stricter because they do it
are the $unc$new $unc$york
i do not know how the $unc$new $unc$york state prison system is
but are they booked up
yeah
that is a way to put it
they are booked up
are they paroling like murderers
and here it is just a real big deal
they parole people that have killed police officers
and then they are out doing it again
right
i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things
uh-huh
but you just hear about that
uh-huh
it is a lot of repeat crime
and you are like why are they repeating
they should have been in there longer
or
i know
and then you think i can remember i have not been out of school that long
but it has been at least $unc$ten years
and you think to yourself was it that bad back then
or is it just
i think that like you said television
is it just that more people think there is excitement in it you know
people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something
it seems like that it is more like in $unc$boston
there was a case of a couple of kids $unc$fifteen year olds
they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone
uh-huh
so they picked on this kid who was new in town
uh-huh
and they were like no one was going to miss him anyway
and it like
god
that is horrible
how can you even think like that
isnt it something
i am originally from $unc$pittsburgh $unc$pennsylvania
and i have a niece and nephew
and i just
my $unc$ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that i am just going $unc$michael how did you hear about that
it is just i think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things
yeah
yeah
in $unc$atlanta where my inlaws live they had that thing the high top sneakers the $unc$air $unc$jordans $unc$et $unc$cetera
right
right
kids killing each other and beating their brains out
for the sneakers
right
or the jackets the team like the $unc$raiders and the caps
yeah
yeah
stealing the $unc$hundred dollar jackets
i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that in $unc$boston
that is crime where they videoed
that is probably $unc$one of the most bizarre i have heard of
yeah
where they videotape themselves
yeah
it seems crime is turning into a pastime instead of be
what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the $unc$boston areas
the major cause it seems up here is exc-
i live right on the ocean
so its kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland
uh-huh
but the major cause here and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution
we dont have too much industrial pollution
yeah
yeah
car pollution seems to be the $unc$one and only thing that i can really put my finger on here
that isnt the same in the $unc$washington area because we dont have any major industry except for government and services
and the transportation situation is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful
also the hub of $unc$three airports
in this general area there is $unc$national $unc$dulles and then $unc$baltimore $unc$washington
and it
interestingly some of the information ive been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from airplanes is extraordinary
is that so
yeah
i didnt know that
and thats always something that you dont think about
most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution
but the
apparently the air pollution and the fact that its delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor
yeah
i would think so
i guess it talked about all types of pollution
i just read something the other day at least in the $unc$boston paper there were $unc$three things that come to note
$unc$one is that the carbon fluorides that are being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer
and again
and now theyve located an expanding $unc$one in the northern hemisphere
so car-
so im quite concerned
i dont think its involved any longer with hair sprays or those th-
yeah
yeah
no
i think from what i understand its air conditioning units
and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society
uh-huh
yeah
i know in $unc$florida theres no place you go that isnt air conditioned
and i do quite a bit of business in $unc$washington
and
what its like here
yeah
its quite
is the un-
its really out of the norm not to find something that isnt air conditioned
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i guess refrigerators are the same way
we just had the
they release that
thats right
so solutions to this would be
yeah
i
improved
i guess to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
yeah
this is so basic
its human rights in the sense
but in terms of demanding its just not caused
but demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses planes that something can be done i cant imagine that
i th-
if we cant send people to the moon that we cant improve these things
yeah
no
i think that it can be done simply because weve
every car now in $unc$america thats been produced for the past $unc$fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter
converter
yeah
uh-huh
and no lead gas came to the pumps
and thats been done
theres the lead pollution that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was licked
uh-huh
and i think that there are solutions
and that for buses
certainly we dont even need a research anymore
its just a matter of passing the law
and passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is
thats right
and also to make it economically feasible and also in buses
thats right
thats right
i dont know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus
yeah
that
the smell is awful
but i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i guess youre better off sitting behind a bus than a car although i could never really rationalize that while i was sitting there
yeah
but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels
yeah
im thinking of research in that direction rather than
weve taken the intermediate step
but i dont think fossil fuels are the answer
we
up here in $unc$new $unc$england where ive
right close to where i live is the $unc$seabrook $unc$nucleus site which is practically a guerilla war up here went on for years
uh-huh
yes
i me-
my daughters marched against the $unc$seabrook
and i kind of
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to jump from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
yeah
yeah
you dont throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
yeah
unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years
yeah
yeah
so we really dont know whether theres enough fossil fuel left
or there isnt
and
but with the pollution issue fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
no
so youve got to look elsewhere
yeah
but it is something thats a little frightening
and in fact i
within our family we have said
my husband
i have $unc$two sons
$unc$one is already in college in $unc$new $unc$england
yeah
and the other will be going in $unc$september
and we just feel that when we leave this area were going north not south
yes
i like the mentality north
and i also like the fresher air up there
thats right
so thats the way we will be going
yeah
so id be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are
since $unc$texas and $unc$louisiana and $unc$california in that ranking order the worst pollutants in $unc$america
uh-huh
i read that the other day
$unc$louisiana for a small state it was amazing
but its the industrial pollution i should imagine
uh-huh
and $unc$california seems to be taking steps
you read about the fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now theyre enforcing
the smog and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
but again that didnt occur without a crisis
nothing will occur i guess without a crisis
even $unc$california was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here
yeah
exactly
exactly
the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as im concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants
and it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers dont think that
but that to me was pollution
thats personal air pollution
that was its most personal pollution that i can think of
yes
yes
yeah
i definitely advance that
listen i enjoyed speaking with you
surely
and lets hope there are other people that feel the same way
something happen
right on
thank you
youre welcome
bye-bye
bye-bye
national health insurance i think is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive
right
yeah
because the articles that ive read regarding national health service in $unc$canada and $unc$england has indicated that
what i-
stay in line for $unc$four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
right
yeah
im sort of mixed on this
i think that the answer may lie not in so much a national kind of medical thing that $unc$england has but more of a national insurance sort of clearinghouse or whatever
i think that too many
the problem right now is that weve got too many different health insurances that people have to go through
and i think you mentioned $unc$canada
i think that they have a system where the government deals with
you go to whoever you want but file through $unc$one particular setup
i see
and that way they are able to reduce prices because its all $unc$one centralized thing
yeah
i think that again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you dont have a company picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is almost prohibitive
uh-huh
right
i was listening on the radio the other day
and they were talking that something like this
i think they were talking about the fact that the money that could be saved in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider could
they could make it provide health insurance to people who couldnt afford it just by the money they would save
yeah
were currently where im working now under $unc$blue $unc$cross
i dont know what the total cost of the program is
but for dependent coverage im paying a $unc$hundred and $unc$seventy dollars a month or something like that
right
so i assume that probably the total cost is probably $unc$three $unc$fifty to $unc$four $unc$hundred
theyre probably picking up about half of it
right
and thats a pretty good policy
but if you had something like $unc$one of these health maintenance programs $unc$h $unc$m $unc$o where you go to the doctor and it only costs you $unc$ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest if you tried to buy something like that it would probably be $unc$five or $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something
yeah
$unc$h $unc$m $unc$o
yeah
and theyre fairly expensive
i was on an $unc$h $unc$m $unc$o up until last year through work
yeah
and it was
i forget how much i paid a month
but it is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care
yeah
and the reason i quite was not because i didnt like it
i really kind of did
the reason i quite was just because a certain doctor that we enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that $unc$h $unc$m $unc$o
so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor
yeah
so we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work
yeah
and i like the convenience of the $unc$h $unc$m $unc$o in a certain respect because even though youre
once you find the doctor that you like its not a problem
a lot of people complain saying i dont want to have to be told who i need to go to
but if you dont have a doctor anyway normally it doesnt really make much difference if you find someone you really like
yeah
thats right
and then we did find several good doctors
and like you say its $unc$five dollars an office visit
and my wife was in the hospital had our daughter
and i think her total bill was around $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars for everything
goodness
delivery room and everything
yeah
including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay
but that was still included in that cost
so
yeah
its really nice because their attitude is different than a $unc$h $unc$m $unc$o
theyre trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end and have you come in
yeah
they charge $unc$five dollars
a pop
yeah
youre more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big
as to a companys benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
yeah
because they dont have to worry about going in and paying $unc$seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for $unc$ten minutes
right
thats a
yeah
i really liked it
my wife and i both did
you dont have to worry about filling out forms for reimbursement and all or getting paid $unc$eight percent of whatever
you just pay the $unc$five dollars right then
and then youre done with it
yeah
but here again the doctors practices in hospitals have become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now
uh-huh
you take a hospital the physical plant itself
you have to pay your share of the operating of that $unc$eight story building when the rooms are empty
right
so they spread the costs out over all the patient costs
and thats how you come up with aspirin that costs $unc$four dollars apiece and things like that the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and it being a $unc$four $unc$thousand dollar bill
right
theyre taking up the cost of people who cant pay
right
they get a lot of people who just have to be there and cant afford it
and so they know theyre not going to get money from them
yeah
so they have to absorb it somewhere else
yeah
yeah
my daughter and son-in-law had a baby here about what
hell be $unc$three in $unc$august
uh-huh
and their insurance plan that theyre under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital
right
and she went in
she had the baby
and she was out in $unc$two days time
right
and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital
right
the deductibles didnt apply
right
and so thats $unc$one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by
okay
if youll shorten your stay then we will waive the deductible
right
our insurance is doing something similar where theyre also going to mor-
so what movies have you seen lately
lately ive seen soap dish
oh
which was a
and that was a lot of fun
it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things
thats something i want to see
yeah
thats on my list to see
yeah
it was okay
it was not a wonderful film
but it was cute but not the biggest laugh ive seen
okay
i saw $unc$thelma and $unc$louise a couple of days ago and really liked that
did you
actually i saw it twice because i liked it so much
oh
thats also on my list
and its really disturbing but a good movie
a disturbing movie
how do you mean
it was
lets see
the
its different
its an shoot em up kind of film
right
but its with women in it instead of men
so thats kind of a twist on the normal thing
a switcheroo
and it made me think a lot about
you would applaud $unc$bruce $unc$willis in die hard if he was doing this
but you might not be so encouraging of $unc$susan $unc$sarandon and then $unc$gena $unc$davis when they do it
right
when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it
so that was kind of interesting
ive
but i really enjoyed it
oh
so i w-
because that just reminds me of back in school
and the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble
yeah
thats kind of what it was
but
right
yeah
they had started out with that
then they got into lots of trouble
before we found the shopping malls thats what we did
uh-huh
yeah
ill have to keep that on my list then
yeah
i also saw that $unc$madonna movie
oh
its truth or dare
and that was pretty scandalous
scandalous
yeah
it was kind of
yeah
$unc$madonna shes pretty trashy
i can imagine
and so it was interesting
i guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is
righ-
i think she kept saying that
they talked about her
it was a film of her concert tour she had taken all around the world
and they were all to her at the $unc$vatican city and wouldnt let her perform in $unc$rome
and she kept saying that her show was not garbage
it had a social message to it
and
you just had to find it
you had to wade through it and find it
right
we never quite believed that
so
you never quite got to
i thought that was pushing it a little bit
but she
all i know about that woman is that shes an incredible marketeer
she is
shes rich
yeah
and shes rich
and she
yeah
so
shes smart at what she does
she knows how to do that
she knows how to twist this around
yeah
what did you think about dances with wolves when you saw it
okay
were getting back to last year
thats probably the last movie i saw dances with wolves
i just adored it
really
how can i tell you
maybe $unc$ten years ago i had read bury my heart at $unc$wounded $unc$knee
and so just the general theme of the whole movie was pretty
uh-huh
i really liked it a lot
right
i mean it was a real consciousness raiser i guess
and i only bring up $unc$wounded $unc$knee because that was what $unc$ten years ago you read and understood about the $unc$indian population
right
and then everything went away for a couple years
uh-huh
and now its back again
and its sort of a popular view of what happened way back then
right
of course no one will ever know
really i dont kn-
i know
i was
i wondered if the tribe that was the evil tribe if they were really as bad as it made them to be
who knows
it sort of showed $unc$two different types of tribes
$unc$one was a warring tribe
and the other one was vegetarian kind of feel good tribe sort of thing
right
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world
uh-huh
nobody can get along peacefully
yeah
but i wonder
i thought the-
because they made a big deal about how this film was such a big leap for the people who were the ancestors of this indian tribe
and that was so wonderful that they done that
and i wonder if they were offended by the film
i see
if it
you didnt hear any press about that
yeah
i thought it was a very interesting movie
i think so
i have come to respect a little bit more what went on here
right
but who knows how its supposed to all end
uh-huh
right
on the broad scope it had a much bigger meaning to me
i think about just the meaning of the freedom of this country and what that really meant
right
and that was taking over somebody elses freedoms and sort of trampling that
uh-huh
so it meant something bigger i think
but still it was a fantas-
i loved the buffalo scene
and i thought $unc$kevin $unc$costner was just
i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every $unc$three minutes
i know the
but hes the director
but yeah
i just thought it was a really interesting intense film
thats good
intense i think is the word for it because $unc$three hours went by really fast
it was good
i looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing
yeah
ate a lot of popcorn
but it put me in a really bad mood
i dont know why
did it really
yeah
we di-
there were $unc$three of us who went
we were just all really grouchy when it was over
so we decided that may be the mark of a good film
it made us think
and so
it made you think
we were grouchy
we felt guilty for being
maybe that was
but there are no answers
i know
and we had nothing to do with it
that can make you crabby yes
we were not responsible
but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on
really
thats true
we could have
but its
they sort of candy coated the western story for many years
right
and when the truth
it always balances out $unc$one way or the other once you get the whole story
uh-huh
but
yeah
righ-
i do
im just out of school
so ive seen a lot of mo-
okay
dont have a job
so i shouldnt go see movies all the time
there you go
i rented a good movie called cinema $unc$paradeso which is an italian movie which is probably the best movie ive seen ever
oh
oh
it was just wonderful
really
its uh story about a little boy in a little italian village
and he owns a
or he works in a movie theater and it helps the projectionist
theres an old man whos the projectionist
and he befriends this old man
and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years
oh
and its just
if you dont mind reading subtitles
i thought i had to kind of get beyond that
those little
reading the little words at the bottom of the screen
but i just laughed and cried
and i really loved it
ill have to write that down
that was a great one
wow
and other than that i
ill have to write that
did you see $unc$texasville
are you into $unc$larry $unc$mcmurtry
no i hadnt
i had read the last picture show
but thats out on video now
and i havent seen it
but i was interested in reading $unc$texasville before i saw the movie
yeah
did you like it
i read a lot of $unc$larry $unc$mcmurtry books
right
and $unc$texasville is just like that
its very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other
uh-huh
its
and its just sort of a
okay
do you have annual family reunions
or
yeah
our
the
my mothers side of the family was quite large at $unc$one time
and they for as long as i can remember have had a yearly reunion
back early on they used to rotate them to different peoples houses in the family
uh-huh
and
all local
were they all in $unc$dallas
no
this was i am actually from $unc$mississippi
and so thats
oh
it was around there generally
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats where the family grew
just from city to city then
yeah
and it was not only in $unc$mississippi in some other places as well
uh-huh
uh-huh
so it was a big deal
but they tried to centralize it in $unc$one spot
so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
uh-huh
uh-huh
we rent a pavilion and do that
and thats usually works out to be pretty good
and they will rent a pavilion on a weekend
and
do you go back
i have not gone back lately
in fact this past $unc$sunday was the reunion
but i did not get to go
i have
is it choice or just business
or
not getting to go
uh-huh
just the distance involved
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
just not
i have a younger daughter now
and i
its kind of hard to get her there and everything
uh-huh
but i am going to hopefully next year get to go back cause a lot of the family on my mothers side has not seen my daughter
so
oh
do you have brothers and sisters
i have $unc$one brother
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
and is your mother still living
yes
so you go back and visit with her anyway
would you not
right
yeah
either way there was family reunion time or not
right i usually see her a couple times a year
so thats no big thing
but i do enjoy the reunions
the only problem is that now originally when we had them they were mainly my mothers
relatives
right
fathers
my mothers fathers family had quite a few brothers and sisters
uh-huh
so it was a large reunion of that group from that descendants
uh-huh
and a lot of those people have
and at time they all knew $unc$one another
right
right
and now it has gotten that a lot of those people have died off
or what we are left with is the relatives of that group
the next generation
uh-huh
and so its not quite as close as it used to be
so i think people feel less of a desire to really go
i know that
why do you think that its less close than it used to be
i just think at that ti-
when they were a-
those were all brothers and sisters a lot
or they were all in the same geographical location
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
back around in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up they were all located together in $unc$one small community
right
right
right
and when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth
and now when they come together its generally
say the kids of those people who are not anywhere near $unc$one another and i do not think they feel the closeness that used to be there which is a shame
uh-huh
but thats just how it is
my mother was complaining last year about th-
its dwindling down every year
i think thats just
is that familys lack of priority anymore maybe
we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
yeah
yeah
thats
yeah
i think thats some of it
but i have
i
its just the way i think society is now is that we do not have the extensive family we used to
uh-huh
its more of a smaller unit
and we tend to try to do things i think with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know very well
right
right
it really makes an effort to do this anymore
right
it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing
right
right
i used to enjoy going
i still do kind of enjoy it
but its not as many people there that i really enjoy seeing
right
right
i
its going just for the sake of getting together
i think for the family
and
do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother thats in that group on a regular basis not just $unc$christmas cards
no
not really
in that
but then again i have some aunts that i do
thats about th-
my mothers sisters
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them
but as for the rest of that group no not really
right
and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion
so
right
right
you do not really feel that really close to them
right
in my fathers family we get together every year at a different location either $unc$dallas or $unc$oklahoma $unc$city
they had chosen $unc$santa $unc$barbara $unc$california for this summer and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or in the $unc$texas $unc$oklahoma area
uh-huh
and so they cancelled that $unc$one and are looking next year bringing it back closer
but we have a family letter that circulates
uh-huh
and it usually goes through me twice a year
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote thats on the bottom and put your new letter on the top
and then thats the way its kept in order
about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like i do not know anything about this person
you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth
thats a good idea
so you are kind of half way acquainted that way
right
and thats been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other i think
yeah
right
we tried to start that in my husbands family
his mothers side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago
and i said lets start this letter
and it just never
my husbands sisters started it and sent it to us
and thats as far as it got
i sent it on to the next one
yeah
but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in $unc$scottsdale $unc$arizona for that family
uh-huh
we are real glad we got together because since that time there were only $unc$one sister and $unc$one sister-in-law of the original family left
and the sister-in-law died
and the sister is in a nursing home
so we are glad that we took that opportunity $unc$two years ago
okay
since i initiated the call i guess ill start off first
number $unc$one i have absolutely no problem with random testing
i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job
and i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and such
id feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what ive been hearing in the newspapers
so i really dont have a problem with it
yeah
i dont either
ive never
i dont work at home right now
i stay home with my children
but my husband works
and they do have that at his place of employment
and neither of us have a problem with it
weve particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such
its a scary thing to know that you just dont know what people are doing before they go to work
uh-huh
and the advertisements on television lately have been so
there have been so many
theres
yeah
just about
train wrecks and things like that
i feel like
probably just for our own safety when were traveling and things that would be something id like to know thats going on
yeah
i happen to be
my job is im supervisor of personnel safety for the worlds largest paint company
so its very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing
and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs
and we at the present time do not have random testing
and i am pushing towards that
i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they shouldnt have a problem with it
right
and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because were talking major liabilities
not only with themselves but with other employees
uh-huh
and i really
theyre talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis
yeah
i have a real fear
that at some point somethings going to happen
and theyre showing it with aids
so why
they ought to start doing something with the drugs
so i really have no problem with it
yeah
its unfortunate i think that everyone doesnt have that opinion
ive heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel its an invasion of privacy and things like that
but in the long run it seems to me its kind of like what they keep talking about the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that
uh-huh
they feel thats not fair and whatever
but those kind of things id like to know myself
yes
it wouldnt be
in my opinion
ive had a lot of dental work done
and the last dentist didnt even use gloves at all
so
really
that kind of
yeah
so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me
that scares me because if thats the way they are
i
if i were a dentist id want to be protected too
you would think so
uh-huh
that is because
and i worked for a dentist
and thats
you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that
and its real real dangerous
uh-huh
i would think
but with all the accidents just with everything happening with
just
airlines just drive me crazy
people are afraid to fly now just because they dont know what their pilots been doing and things like that
right
and
uh-huh
i dont know
where youre located i do know $unc$texas $unc$instruments has random drug testing
uh-huh
and i think theyve had it for several years
and their program they had i dont think had a lot of problems associated with it
but my brother-in-law happens to work there
and it sounded very positive
and i think its great
i would encourage it
im pushing our company towards that
and if they do find someone who is having a problem with drugs
and they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on without any support and whatever
right
exactly
because a lot of people seems like obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things
uh-huh
and too many people are just dying particularly in our area
right
i dont know what the crime is like where you are
but the crime rate here is just astronomical
ours is changing
yeah
ours is changing
its increasing
i live in a very nice suburb
and its unbelievable whats going on and the selling of drugs
its just too loose
its too free
uh-huh
i just got a piece of paper the other day that now they have these
i have $unc$two very little children under $unc$two
uh-huh
and i got a piece of paper from my husbands office
its talking about these drug tattoos now that they have got
really
it looks like a sticker
and its for kid
the question was on lawn and garden work
how do you like it
i dont do much of it here
im from $unc$colorado originally
and there are no bugs there
and i didnt mind getting in the dirt there
but boy ill tell you what
once i see these bugs around here im just kind of out of it
what kind do you have
roaches and
do they really
yes
cockroaches are awful here
oh
just awful
so i
and i know somebody that lives there
and they never mentioned that problem
youre kidding
no
its a d-
maybe they didnt mention it because its just kind of a fact of life around here
and
my
they probably just take it for granted then
it must be
if they lived here a lot of people i know just say i just stomp on them
it doesnt matter
they make good fertilizer in the garden
yuck
me personally cant
i dont have that problem
its
mine is mainly
we kind of have an understanding that i said ill do inside work you do outside work
uh-huh
and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that
uh-huh
but i dont like it dirty
no
i have to say thats not exactly my favorite thing either really
no
i dont know
we got the question
and i thought this is going to be interesting
$unc$two bits ill get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all
but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work
and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home
so weve been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall
today we just had a lot of rain
really
yeah
so its kind of nice
i dont know how yours has been
its been real hot here lately
weve had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything
but doe-
its supposed to rain again now this weekend
i see
so then
okay
were leaving tomorrow
and were going down to $unc$new $unc$orleans
and from $unc$ohio since were right near $unc$lake $unc$erie
this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there
yeah
and i think well probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity
but as far as the gardening and things like that goes i dont know too much about how much i really do enjoy it myself
yeah
do you like it at all
not here
its just here
i just cant stand to even get out in the dirt
just
how about when you were in $unc$colorado
i liked it a little bit
but i didnt
i was working at that time full-time and didnt have a lot of time for that
uh-huh
and so that i think really hampered it a little bit
and then too where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was high
and if you have that on a regular basis in $unc$texas i think i would go with something very dry to keep it off
yeah
and with children you probably dont have time anyhow to get into it
no
not really
its so very good
uh-huh
i guess weve kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we
sounds like i-
no
no
afraid not
hopefully theyll give a subject i like $unc$one of these times $unc$something i really know a lot about
right
okay
right
wh-
nice talking to you
nice talking with you
okay
bye-bye
uh-huh
bye
okay
so you said that you live in $unc$coppell
uh-huh
so what is your house like
its a $unc$two bedroom $unc$two baths duplex
thats neat
brick and
uh-huh
is it $unc$one youre renting or buying
no
we own it
yeah
our side
yeah
yeah
thats kind of neat that even though its a duplex you can still buy
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats good
uh-huh
yeah
do you have any children
no
huh-uh
do you
yes
i have $unc$two children
and our home is really too small for us right now
ours is too
we outgrew it when we moved in
yeah
we moved from an apartment that was really small
uh-huh
and at the time we just had a little baby that was $unc$five months old
uh-huh
so we moved into this house in $unc$garland
its in $unc$one of the older areas of town
uh-huh
and $unc$one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere
uh-huh
lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty
but the house is real small
yeah
it has less than a $unc$thousand square feet
wow
yeah
its real little
you all are cramped
yeah
and now i have a daughter
now the $unc$one that was $unc$five months old is $unc$seven years old
uh-huh
and i have another one thats $unc$three and a half and have all these clothes and toys and stuff that were just trying to find places to put
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
how many bedrooms is it
they advertised it as a $unc$three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room
uh-huh
uh-huh
but the room thats built on doesnt have a closet
oh
so the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
uh-huh
but we have always just put our computer and extra toys and books and
uh-huh
its kind of a catch all room
but it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
yeah
they all go out there to play with the $unc$barbies and that kind of stuff
uh-huh
so
how fun
yeah
that works out good
and im thankful i have $unc$two girls because theyre in bunk beds
and so they can share a room and make for more space that way
uh-huh
uh-huh
and how olds the youngest
shes $unc$three and a half
uh-huh
yeah
and right now we have their clothes on double racks in the closet
uh-huh
we made a higher and a lower
uh-huh
and it works out fine
but theyre just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag
uh-huh
and were going to have to figure out a new idea
but were kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
yeah
yeah
so that would be nice
thats what wed like to do
yeah
is $unc$coppell a nice area to live
its a wonderful place to live
and they
i dont have any kids
so i dont really know
but they say that we have wonderful schools
i think ive heard a lot about $unc$coppell schools that theyre real good
uh-huh
thats neat
do you hope to have children
or are you not planning on having any
or
i dont think so
no
i see
do you have any pets
of course those are my kids
yeah
i have $unc$two dogs
uh-huh
do they stay inside
or
yeah
theyre inside dogs
thats neat
theyre my babies
yeah
what are the colors in your house
kind of a mauve and gray
i bet thats pretty
uh-huh
and then the kitchens kind of a country pink and country blue
and its all done in cows
uh-huh
im a cow nut
thats neat
i like cows too
uh-huh
yeah
our house was redo-
our house is very old also
uh-huh
its like $unc$thirty-seven years old
wow
yeah
and it was redone before we moved in which
im thankful for that
but the
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in
yeah
everything is
yeah
the carpets kind of a tan and brown and has paneling in the living room and lots of tans and lots of browns
uh-huh
uh-huh
but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that
yeah
yeah
so thats worked out good
in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan wallpaper had done it up with blues
uh-huh
so thats nice
sounds pretty
yeah
weve enjoyed living here
its close to my oldest daughters school
oh
and that makes it really handy too
uh-huh
uh-huh
and she really likes her school
so
good
and we are so close to shopping
and
thats an important factor there
yeah
how about in $unc$coppell
ive always imagined it kind of away from everything
now we have that new mall in $unc$lewisville
really
and thats just a mile or $unc$two from our house
thats nice
but when we first moved to $unc$coppell its what $unc$six years ago we didnt even have a grocery store
wow
and now we have $unc$four
oh
and coppells not really big enough to support $unc$four grocery stores
yeah
yeah
but it does sound like its definitely growing
very much
yeah
in fact its about the size now
i moved down here from $unc$chicago what $unc$twenty-three years ago to $unc$lewisville
uh-huh
uh-huh
and coppells now about the size that $unc$lewisville was when i moved down here
i see
when we first moved here we moved here from $unc$lubbock
uh-huh
and we almost moved to $unc$lewisville
that was our second choice behind $unc$garland
really
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
do you have an opinion on credit cards
i do
you do
what do you think about them
i think they get a lot of people in trouble
yeah
definitely
i have $unc$one right now
and i just got it about $unc$six months ago
uh-huh
and i find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldnt get
yeah
and then you dont stop to realize that
you charge this for $unc$twenty charge that for $unc$twenty charge this for $unc$twenty
and pretty soon you owe a $unc$hundred dollars
and you dont stop to think about it
yeah
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago $unc$ten to $unc$fifteen $unc$thousand dollars in trouble
my goodness
so i eventually got it all paid
now i carry $unc$one
i have a gas card and a $unc$visa card
and i never use them unless i need to
really
but they
thats good
d-
yeah
i made a rule with myself when i got $unc$one that if i couldnt pay it in full every month that id have to rip it up
so
yeah
thats
and interest rates arent none too shallow these days anyway
yeah
but
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially
we have
im in $unc$lubbock
and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to $unc$tech
and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
uh-huh
i have a couple friends too that have about $unc$three of them maxed out
and they cant do anything but work to try to pay them off
yeah
and $unc$one of my friends hers is up to $unc$nine $unc$hundred dollars
and she only earns like $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars a month because shes going to school
gee
and so thats just enough to pay rent and buy like $unc$thirty-five dollars worth of food a month and pay for her monthly fee $unc$twen-
i guess you have to pay $unc$twenty dollars each month is the
yes
something like that
so all shes paying is interest on hers every month
yeah
it just seems crazy to me
but
my wife got in trouble one time with hers
she was making i dont know what she was making $unc$forty-five dollars a month i think
and $unc$fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit
and $unc$fifteen dollars of it was interest
so she was only paying in it $unc$fifteen dollars a month
yeah
and that was before we got married
so
but its
we sat down and talked about it and discussed it
and its come out pretty good
now we have a $unc$eighteen year old thats fixing to get out of high school and go to college
really
thats the first thing he wanted
was a $unc$visa card
yeah
my goodness
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
i bet
so
yeah
i dont know
im about sick of mine right now
i dont
but i think theyre too readily accessible
uh-huh
and theres too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped
you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it
but thats a lot of pain and hassle
in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldnt afford everything we didnt have such things as credit cards
we just waited until time come around that we could afford it
right
and we had all the necessities
and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities
i always use it for something i want not something i need
exactly
yeah
my parents are really good about not using credit cards
they are against it
yeah
i dont think they like the fact that i have $unc$one either
i think if cards were as stringent as say a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldnt have the problems we have
uh-huh
of course we wouldnt have the retail market we have either
so i guess they trade $unc$one for the other
yeah
i disagree with it
but they still trade $unc$one for the other
thats good
im
it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for
you sound pretty young
so
yeah
im $unc$twenty right now
are you
yeah
so just going to school and working
so
all right
it does kind of get in the
when you want something that
last weekend was homecoming
and i needed a pair of shoes
oh
so i just went out and bought them on my credit card
yeah
i didnt really have the money to do it
but
yeah
its pretty easy
yeah
it sure is
so do you just have $unc$two kids
or
we have a $unc$eighteen year old $unc$seventeen year old and a $unc$seven year old
really
yeah
neat
im from $unc$plano $unc$texas
are you
but right now im out in $unc$provo $unc$utah going to $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
so
youre a $unc$mormon then
yep
all right
but this is a extra long one
whats that
theyre giving us a lot of time
yeah
they must not have too much traffic on $unc$saturdays
yeah
have you done a lot of this
$unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty i guess
really
yeah
do you do it every day
i try to every day
i get calls at work
i get calls at home
so
wha-
and thats an idea thats been kicked around for a long time
i dont know that its ever been seriously considered as far as close to passing any legislation or anything like that
but i believe $unc$israel does that dont they for their
yes
i think so
everybody has to do something
yeah
i dont kn-
or maybe theirs is in fact $unc$one year of military service for everyone
but
yeah
i believe thats right
okay
and i dont know that thats really what were talking about
no
i dont think its n-
i think of that
it couldnt be
military service is not that much
but the military used to do it
but the idea that there are things that do need to be done that could be done
and then country would benefit from $unc$one year from everybody and even out the requirement
yeah
for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
thats a thought
yeah
it could even be done while theyre doing a job to make money
yeah
but its such a grassroots idea that it
i think the family would have to be involved in it
uh-huh
and people would have to be convinced that
i think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving
yeah
right
and thats not the kind of society we have right now
yeah
im afraid youre right there
but anything like this that came up whether it
it quickly would be significant industry in figuring out how to get around it where people
theres lots and lots of volunteer programs
but at least its my opinion that most of those involve adults adults who have the time to give and the desire to give
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
its not
maybe it cou-
younger people feel like its not open to them
i dont know
but it should be if its not
yeah
i suspect that thats not the thing that they dont feel its open to them
its just that they are more self-centered if you will and not considering a voluntary
yeah
it is kind of an introspective time of life
yeah
but some high schools have actually started a visitation program to less advantaged areas
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they promote service on the part of the kids to some of those people
so at least thats a step in the right direction i guess
yeah
yeah
and now i dont know it di-
i think youre right that thats not the way that the society these days is going
and i think we need to try to figure out some way to turn that around that everybody
its really unfortunate because when you do
i do volunteer work for the $unc$american $unc$lung $unc$association
and i have gone to work for $unc$american $unc$heart and just recently for the $unc$leukemia $unc$society
and theres no question that doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than the people involved
yeah
its really a gift to yourself
and i think thats a really important lesson to learn
yeah
and maybe thats why we have so many people in society who are not really happy
that could be
because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself youre just kind of down the tube
yeah
right
it really is better to give then to receive
yeah
i agree with that
and i dont know what has set it off or what
but it certainly seems to me that in the last $unc$twenty-three years things have definitely gone towards very much the concentration on self and loss of perspective in terms
hi
so what was the last car repair you had
just recently i was kind of laughing when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because i had to have my radiator flushed
oh
and it was getting rusty
and the thing that they forgot to do was to also look at the hose
and i had gone about $unc$two days with my new radiator flushed
and the hose burst
so i was stranded out on the highway
no
did you crack the block or what
no
i didnt do that thank goodness
but there seemed to be enough antifreeze left to do that
but it cost me all kind of money to have that repaired after they said they had repaired it
so that was a horrible experience just recently
yeah
i see
you got lucky you didnt ruin the whole engine though
yes
yes
that can be pretty serious
i know
i know
what about you
i guess its been awhile for me
id sa-
its been about a year
uh-huh
yeah
i had the water pump break on my car
oh
yeah
i was traveling
i was going on my way home from $unc$thanksgiving
uh-huh
and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
uh-huh
so i had to get it towed and then fixed
and
uh-huh
big pain
i know
especially when youre out on the highway
yeah
thats where i was
luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know living in $unc$dallas
weve got bumper to bumper $unc$eight lanes of traffic
and that was horrible
yeah
to have the
your car is fuming
and everything
its already a $unc$hundred degrees
you dont need that too
shoot
but my car is getting old
its about $unc$six years old now
so
yeah
so is mine
yeah
so i got it right out of college
and so its starting to show the wear and tear now
yeah
im hoping mine gets me through
i got until $unc$may until im out
so when i cross that one ill be okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that was my graduation present to myself
so
thats nice
yeah
yeah
i know
but gosh its really starting to wear
so ive been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
yeah
go-
because i dont know if i want to pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when its starting to breakdown
yeah
i dont want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
and its not worth it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
thats true
i agree with you there
yeah
so i dont know
because i need to have it tuned up and i dont know replace some of the belts
and i was looking at the
tires need to be replaced
and so i was thinking just a lot of money
im
might as well buy me a new car for that
yeah
i got new tires last winter too
so im like thats the last major purchase for this thing
its not worth it
uh-huh
you have to in $unc$pennsylvania boy
you have to really have your car winterized and stuff
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains
really
yeah
okay
so
lot of snow and a lot of cold
uh-huh
especially dont you have what a lot of salt on the ground
yeah
at times theres a lot of it
uh-huh
you got to clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
yeah
yeah
rust and the body too
yeah
i havent had a big problem with that though
uh-huh
so ive been pretty lucky there
i think they get the new $unc$z-bart stuff and everything to where you can
yeah
thats usually pretty good
you just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it
uh-huh
yeah
and go like that so
yeah
i usually like to do most repairs on my own though
do you
yeah
just because that way i know whats wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesnt
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
plus if something goes wrong i know who to blame
i think im getting too old for all that
i had $unc$four brothers
and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff
so i can do all that stuff
but i think id much prefer to pay the $unc$twenty-two $unc$ninety-five to go have it done now
so i can get my hands dirty
so yeah
im just getting to that age i guess
you just dont have
your time becomes very precious
so working on the car is just not $unc$one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore
more fun things to do
absolutely absolutely
so yeah
im trying to
i just need $unc$one
i had $unc$two cars there for a while
so i wouldnt have to worry about which car was going to run
thats nice
and yeah
but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them
yeah
and yeah
so that
$unc$one is bad enough
yes
one was bad enough
but i think i got rid of the wrong one
i need a lot of repairs done on this one
so yeah
that was something else
are our $unc$five minutes up
yeah
i was just wondering that
i didnt set the time or anything to
yeah
i didnt either
yeah
put
yeah
this must be a hard category
yeah
i guess
unless youre big do-it-yourselfer to fix up your own cars and things like that
but i guess they were talking about experiences
i did
my parents live in $unc$ohio
so i do know something about the really cold weather
and ive always lived down here in the south
and i took my car up there to their house
and i guess i had a crack in the block
and when i got up there the car
all right
lets see
how old are you $unc$lisa
im $unc$twenty
okay

older
older than you are

wow
yeah
so i think i would like to go to $unc$arizona
i was in $unc$phoenix last $unc$january
but it was rainy and icky
really
it was the coldest its been there ever in $unc$january
i think its very cold
so do you travel a lot
but i would like to go to $unc$tempe
or
do we travel a lot
some yeah
i was a travel agent
oh
i have been up until just a few months ago
but im thinking of going back to work
yeah
so you know a lot of good vacation spots
i know a lot of good places to go
but you definitely need to go to $unc$hawaii
very definitely
thats your favorite
yes
it is my favorite
my husband hasnt been to $unc$europe yet
and id like to take him there
but hes traveled all over the $unc$united $unc$states
and i havent
i havent been down south
id like to go to $unc$new $unc$orleans
have you been there
i havent
where do you live
i live in $unc$yakima $unc$washington
wow
so its cold and rainy today
its yucky
but weve had some pretty nice weather
we played tennis outdoors until last week
so thats a pretty good deal
do you go to school in $unc$provo $unc$utah
i do
do you use $unc$nuskin skin care
theyre located in $unc$provo
i work for $unc$nuskin
do you
yes
im a $unc$nuskin person
really
yeah
i sell $unc$nuskin too
i am my only b-
my goodness
and best cus-
not only and best
but im my best customer
great
since were not supposed to talk about this though is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream
do you know
i dont
maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing i would use
i have that too
im $unc$forty-two
i need something
i need more
than the intensive eye
yeah
i didnt know if there was anything else
and i use the $unc$celltrex
uh-huh
but
yes
$unc$nuskin is wonderful
good
yes
i think its a wonderful product
do you use it
i do
yeah
we get free products every month
so
my gosh
thats great
right
now im getting about $unc$sixty bucks a month free products
so
yeah
yeah
ive worked there about a year
thats good
are they good to work for
yes
theyre wonderful to work for
thats great
yep
so were supposed to be talking about places to go
and you have not been to $unc$europe
do you go to school
uh-huh
do you ski
i ski yes
ive
ski
you probably ski very well in $unc$utah
no
i dont
actually since i grew up in $unc$texas ive only been here about $unc$two years and have gone skiing about $unc$five times each season
why did you move to $unc$utah
you are going to school at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
yeah
i
is that where $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u is
uh-huh
yep
okay
i know some people that went to $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
thats great
pretty good
i do like to ski
pretty down there
yeah
i said i do like to ski
so where have you skied
and its kind of nice being up here just because its all a vacation in itself when you get to go
sure
if you like that kind of thing
sure
youre a sophomore or junior
i am actually a junior beginning of my junior year
youre a junior
good for you
what are you studying
nursing
good for you
you sound like a girl that has it together
i would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married
because when you get married you wont have the money or the time
you think
i know
so just
dont be in any hurry
im not
you really should go to $unc$europe
i went to $unc$europe for $unc$six weeks after i graduated from college
and that was just
i could have had that or a down payment on a new car
and i took the trip
and
and it was great
i traveled with a group of $unc$sixteen other students
actually there was $unc$two other graduating seniors besides myself
and we just had a ball
we stayed at
how long did you get to stay there
$unc$six weeks
really
yeah
it was wonderful
so you should think about doing something like that
uh-huh
i just had a friend that got back from $unc$europe
and she was there all winter semester
were supposed to talk about crime in the city
uh-huh
and seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesnt it
i
thats
sure
i think its
statistics obviously vary greatly
i always thought of $unc$dallas as being a fairly safe place
it is
but our crimes up here as i think it must be in most cities now
but i was listening to the news the other day
and they said they thought the reason it was up so was because so many people are without work nowadays
economys so bad
do you really believe that
its been up every year for many years
and the economy hasnt been this bad for so long has it
thats a good point
thats just what they quoted over the news
yeah
i dont know if i believe that or not
but it does seem up
and
what kind of newspaper do you get down there
what kind
yeah
i think we got a pretty good newspaper
we have $unc$two the $unc$morning $unc$news and the $unc$times $unc$herald
uh-huh
$unc$morning $unc$news seems to have the largest circulation
i think its a pretty good
its a locally owned paper
uh-huh
the $unc$herald is owned i think by the $unc$times out of $unc$l $unc$a or somewhere
yes
but
do they play up the local crime angles
or do they
they dont
no
not really
they dont play it up i dont think
but there is too much of it too many homes broken into
uh-huh
yeah
we had our fact about
last year sometime our home was broken into
really
we
so this is a topic of personal interest
yeah
we
i didnt think ours ever would be burgled
but so many in our neighborhood had been
and because we live on a corner and back up to a real highly traveled main street
uh-huh
yeah
but we were so
so you saw this happening in your neighborhood
and you figured it wouldnt happen to you
sort of yeah
and i never did get a security system
but since that happened i certainly have
yeah
what kind of system do you have
its i guess just a standard with all the doors and the infrared motion detector
uh-huh
pretty standard
is this $unc$one with some company that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff
yes
yes
its monitored and all that
yeah
and
is that a necessary feature to have somebody at the other end of the line
or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise
i think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice
yeah
i really do
but this deal that was part of it for $unc$three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
but it
the monitoring is not that bad though
because weve goofed it up
several times youll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something
and they call back pretty quickly
so i think its all right
but i
to answer your question i think that is a pretty good deterrent in itself
yeah
whether it
so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system
uh-huh
and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line
its got a back up system that doesnt work supposedly that if its cut supposedly it notifies them anyway supposedly
how does it do that
who knows
but thats a selling point
and i think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good
uh-huh
boy they sure advertise so many of them nowadays
sure
but dont you all have a pretty high crime rate up there
yeah
im not saying its any higher than anybody elses
down here we seem to
or not here
but the statistics seem to say that
i dont know
i think its the murder capital of the country now
is that right
yes
i would gather probably from drugs
absolutely
and i think thats the reason its so high everywhere
yeah
but i dont think theres anyplace
used to
years ago you thought these little small cities and all wouldnt have that problem
but they do
yeah
weve had relatives that their children were just as involved in it as anyone
so whats the solution
thats a good question
i dont know
i dont know what the solution is
i really dont
and all these politicians make hay over being anticrime
yeah
but they havent seemed to have changed anything
yep
th-
and nothing seems to change
and im not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it
uh-huh
but they want to buy it
so
yeah
supply and demand
long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them
so i dont know what the solution is
i really dont
yeah
i dont think anyone does in fact
yeah
what
okay
do you have a pet
i have $unc$two cats and $unc$two fish
$unc$two cats
youre lucky
your $unc$two fish
and what do you have
my husband
you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except $unc$one major thing
no
my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman $unc$marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog
so we have a black $unc$labrador
ooh
beautiful gorgeous black $unc$labrador
but to me he belongs up in the farm
and
because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind he sleeps in the laundry room
and then he goes out for the day
but this is a beautiful dog
and he is wonderful with our little girls
and hes comes from a purebred line
and theres nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
right
right
and this is huge
course when he runs around the yard he just digs
he doesnt know that hes tearing up things
but he does
yeah
yeah
and the worst part that i had with him hes $unc$three now was when he was about $unc$eight months old
uh-huh
and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had $unc$one
and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour
and i came home
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
my word
and it was in the floor
and i just about lost it
and i called
and i said come home and get your dog
and so he said puppies just chew when theyre nervous and i wish you had told me
dear
and it was about $unc$eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum
he kept picking at it
and i didnt kn-
the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
so the last thing he did was when i had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard he dug them all up and brought them to the porch
and i told my husband
i said its either me or the dog
and he looked at me like
good-bye
he loves this dog
and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him
and hes a good dog
so its $unc$one of those things im just having to get used to
and thats why i laughed when they called with the topic
i thought boy do i have a pet
but i grew up with cats
and im very comfortable
i love my cats
yeah
i had $unc$one cat for $unc$eighteen years
i got her when i lived in $unc$hawaii
oh
before i even got married i had my cat
shes old
i had to have her put to sleep last $unc$june
isnt she
i started to say
then you broke your heart
it was awful
it was just awful
oh
and she just sat there on my lap
oh
she just waited
and
bless your heart
it was awful
that makes me feel so bad
but her hair
but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husbands shoes
yeah
no
and she just liked his shoes
and hed have these $unc$hundred dollar shoes
oh
no
it was just bad
and my closet
and it was something
thats awful
i never heard of that before
it was terrible
and once she did it then she wouldnt
if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husbands shoes
uh-huh
she must have known he didnt like her or something
or the smell or something
anyway i
and i would bar the closet doors and would clean the carpets
and
uh-huh
dear it was just awful
now does your cat sleep in the house
that was very funny
they are house cats
i have $unc$two cats right now
yeah
and of course
yeah
good
they sleep with my kids
my $unc$fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat
oh
but the cat doesnt destruct does it
it doesnt do anything
no im not going to have a dog
weve had $unc$two dogs
and they both got ran over after we had them for several years just nice little outside dogs
no
but
yeah
were just my kids friends
they would go with me when i would go running
and the last one got hit as she was following $unc$one of my sons across the road to the school
oh
no
it was awful
it was just
that is
and its too heartbreaking
but they do dig up
and they just wreck things
and im not a dog person
they do wreck things
im not either
ooh
im not either
and its just been
i wouldnt want a $unc$lab
it sounds beautiful
but
hes beautiful
but its just $unc$one of those concessions i just had to make
but i kind of ignore him
todays the first cold weve had in $unc$texas
and its really cold and drizzly
and its freezing
and people are doing their fires
and i brought him in because hes just a wet mess out there
and hes in the laundry room with this little carpet square
and hes just huddled up like if youll be nice to me i wont make any trouble
and then my daughters both have hamsters
oh
and i
and how old are your girls
theyre $unc$eleven and $unc$eight
and i gave in at $unc$christmas
yeah
and they keep their cages real clean
it always smells of cedar
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and
sure
i think theyre cutting us off
no
thats
oh
somebodys trying to cut in on my line
and i dont want to answer
okay
ill just wait
okay
no
ive got incoming calls
and i dont know why calling
okay
i hate to cut it off
i think they would cut us off
i understand
so well just wait
okay
whoever it is will call back
theyll cut us off pretty soon
its somebody calling for my kids
jeez
yeah
i know
its my son
i know it is
my older boy he never likes to come home from school
anyway thats what we have
and ive tried to start a fish tank
how does
and i keep losing all my fish
in the salt water
salt water or
no
yeah
just regular water
yeah
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago
theyve statewide raises
they raise ours it seems constantly
we just passed a new one
fortunately or unfortunately it doesnt go into effect because we did not get the $unc$united $unc$airlines
right
indianapolis got that didnt they
right
and we had passed a provisional one that if they did locate here we would raise our taxes
but at least we thought wed get something back from that
yeah
how do you feel about taxes
it seems like a big politics game
up here last year the governor was up for re-election
so he said the budget was fine
the state didnt have any money
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money
so they raised all our taxes
and now its election time again
so theyre trying to lower them
oh
so theyre just talk about lowering them
but they never do
they just keep raising them
ive never seen taxes really go down
yeah
me neither
actually theyre going to here because they didnt have a budget for so long
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last $unc$three months of this year
and theyre going to lower it for next year
oh
i guess they figure theyre going to make up for all they didnt get when they should have had a budget
i hope they put that in writing
yeah
yeah
they say theyre going to lower
but ill see
i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and that the rich are not paying their share
and of course the poor cant afford it either
but i really feel like
and i feel like
im a middle class person income wise anyway
and i get tired of supporting the whole country
yeah
so do i
im middle class barely
but i dont think the rich are paying not enough
i think theyre paying too much
you think the rich are paying too much
yeah
if youre in the $unc$three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month thats ridiculous
why bother working
i dont know many rich that dont have enough tax breaks to
im talking about the really rich
they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
right
that would be fair
ill go along with that
yeah
no loopholes or anything
everybody pays $unc$ten percent or $unc$fifteen or whatever
right
i think that would be fair
right
and i
no ifs ands and buts
no big elaborate laws that call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review
its just you make this you pay $unc$ten percent
if you make a $unc$hundred dollars you pay $unc$ten percent
if you make a $unc$million dollars you pay $unc$ten percent
yeah
thats the way our state tax is here
i think its pretty fair
our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal
uh-huh
and they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate
oh
and you withhold no matter what you do
they withhold what theyre supposed to and at the end of the year its not enough
great
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out
right
so now when you sign your $unc$w-two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state which is ridiculous
uh-huh
but its been that way for the last probably $unc$ten years
yeah
i guess you have to check yes
or you come down to the end of the year
and you dont have it to give it to them
right
unless you have a lot of deductions
yeah
but if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise
really
and you end up owing
you may get $unc$nine $unc$hundred dollars back from federal
and youre going to owe $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred in state
ouch
and its just ridiculous
but i dont know
ive
they just came up with a $unc$twenty-five percent increase on personal property in $unc$oklahoma county and that is a chunk
yeah
ill say
i mean $unc$twenty-five percent increase
y-
is
i guess ive always been kind of interested in space and stuff
ive read a lot of the astronomy books and stuff like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
have you been following the progress of the space health code
to a degree
i havent kept up as much as i would like
uh-huh
ive just been so busy
uh-huh
i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then
so
yeah
i think its pretty exciting that they can
it would be interesting to see if they can find other planets that will be more habitable to humans
and yeah
i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if it is at all possible
yeah
i wouldnt even mind being a pilot on $unc$one
or right now
but im probably getting a little too old for that
i know if they make the advances that they have been making that maybe age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore
right
yeah
they just made leaps and jumps
i think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel equipment and stuff that
yeah
i agree
as a matter of fact were the ones that i have been to $unc$houston to visit the space center out there
and $unc$one of the big advances that we use every day now is $unc$velcro
uh-huh
and that vacuum little space program was $unc$one of the big backers of that
yeah
its amazing
you
its hard to imagine what life was like without it now
yeah
i dont know if you ever watch $unc$gallagher
hes $unc$one of the comedians
and he talks a lot on $unc$velcro
uh-huh
yeah
ive seen him before
what would we do without it
yeah
we were talking about that just the other day
what did we do without it back then
yeah
i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps
yeah
yeah
theres a lot of little things that have come up
i know maybe some of the big things that
concentrated foods for $unc$one maybe
i dont know
thats right
thats right
its also just ive often pictured in my mind what would you find if you just kept on going
uh-huh
thats true
i guess our minds are so what is it finite
uh-huh
when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and its hard to see
uh-huh
yeah
i always thought what do you do hit a brick wall eventually
its hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely
yeah
that is something that would be hard to think about
i agree
you know like you say were used to finite things
and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible
yeah
but
but yeah
i would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can enjoy
yeah
i think its in peoples nature to be the first to do something
uh-huh
and id love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like
yeah
yeah
me too
i wouldnt even mind not so much being first but just get out there and just explore
yeah
i think its in everyones nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they havent or experience something indifferent
i think thats what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity
sure
sure
of course
thats true
there must be some better way of doing this
a better place to be or whatever
its
uh-huh
so you are always looking for something better
yeah
thats true
i know at work people always complain to me
you are always whining
and its im always looking for something better
yeah
theres a better way of doing it than what we are doing it
thats right
thats right
and if you are just content with the way things are then you must lead a pretty dull life
yeah
because if yo-
they are always finding easier ways
and just because they dont talk about it or something like that
uh-huh
and they are doing it unconsciously
yeah
i guess you dont really think about it too much
i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
but yo-
its a subconscious thing
somewhere they can sit down and write down what things that youve improved upon
you probably wouldnt have a pretty good list
uh-huh
but you just dont think about them
right
and thats true
i think
weve gotten different programs at work to make it visible to management that we are doing things better
how many credit cards do you have
i think im down to $unc$one
my gosh
i wish i was that way
is that why you said i had more experience than you
no
i was pulling your leg
oh
how do you use your credit card
do you just keep it in reserve
or
i
the way id like to try and use it is you make your purchases at prime buying time
uh-huh
and then you pay that off and dont use it until its paid off
uh-huh
thats my ideal way
uh-huh
how do you use it
emergencies come along
and i use it
yeah
thats understandable
my car had a major problem $unc$seven $unc$hundred dollars
uh-huh
and things just come up
right
right
and you just never get to use it the way youd really like to
uh-huh
uh-huh
actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have
and i use them
my $unc$american $unc$express i use for gas things like that
and i pay that off monthly
and then some other credit cards like store credit cards i do have them up there a little bit
but
uh-huh
i try not to use them too often
but living in this area i live $unc$fifteen miles west of $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
its a very expensive area
yeah
so sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something
yeah
i know i was up in there and a lot of credit cards
and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble
right
so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it
uh-huh
i just
uh-huh
that was good that you had the opportunity to do that
yeah
uh-huh
are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card
or
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there
uh-huh
uh-huh
our only credit card is $unc$sears
and i have that for automotive purposes
uh-huh
right
right
well thats great
everyone i know here uses credit cards like theyre going out of business to be honest with you
yeah
yeah
its just too easy basically just get yourself in trouble with those
yeah
yeah
yeah
the only other one i have
i have a diners club where i work
i see
so that i use because i travel some
so i use that
and i dont really have to worry about that because i only use it for business
so i automatically have the money to pay it off
yeah
but
i wouldnt mind getting back into $unc$one if they would
you start out at a low limit
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
uh-huh
and if i can get $unc$one thatll keep my limit at $unc$five $unc$hundred and i can never go over that or something then thats fine
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they
eventually gets up there to $unc$ten $unc$thousand whatever $unc$fifty $unc$thousand
uh-huh
yeah
forget it
i dont want that
the temptations too great
yeah
so i dont know
just
writing checks is just as easy i guess
yeah
thats true
thats true
so i guess weve kind of exhausted this topic
yeah
really
what can you
yeah
you cant say too much about it really
other than you use them or you dont use them
you like them
or you dont like them
so
uh-huh
i guess they dont care if we end it early
so hopefully you have a good $unc$thanksgiving
thats coming up
and then maybe well talk again
okay
you too
yeah
may be
youre the furthest person actually that ive talked
ive talked to a lot of people in $unc$texas
yeah
yeah
$unc$texas is the big one
yeah
so
okay then
bye now
okay
bye-bye
how do you feel about capital punishment
im not certain that it does a lot of good that it ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital penalties
right
you dont think
yet on the other hand i dont know
there is things that
seems like its the right thing to do
a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns $unc$fifty children in a school yard
you kind of
i dont know
what about yourself
i have the same dilemma i think
it seems right sometimes
and then other times you dont know
uh-huh
people
i
its been
the $unc$arab societies and stuff end up having effective punishments
and theyre extremely severe
i think to a certain degree the reason that it doesnt serve as a deterrent may be because you never know if its going to be applied right
like in $unc$arab societies if you get caught stealing they chop off your hand
and you walk around the rest of your life with $unc$one hand
right
and everybody knows exactly what for
right
and here with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can kind of always count on the fact
or there is a good chance youre going to get off
uh-huh
and also it doesnt seem like it does that many harm
sure their life is taken
but theyd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway
so i think sometimes theyd prefer just to get it over with
so its more of the easy way out than making them pay for what theyve done
some people
yeah
except that the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high something i was amazed at per year
its something like $unc$twenty $unc$thousand dollars per inmate per year to keep people in jail
yeah
and its sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment
uh-huh
but on the other hand i dont know if that is that serious that theyre really never going to be out of jail
right
but then again also you cant bring back lives that have been taken anyway
so its
uh-huh
it doesnt
it seems that by
i dont know
doesnt ever really p-
i know
you cant
taking $unc$one more life doesnt get things back the way they were right
yeah
right
it doesnt bring back every
yeah
i really dont know
what state are you in
im in $unc$texas
really
w-
in $unc$dallas
no
im in $unc$austin
really
where are you calling from
right now im in $unc$utah
but im from $unc$plano $unc$texas
i see
uh-huh
what are the laws like in $unc$texas
$unc$texas is $unc$one of the s-
i guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment
$unc$texas has had it for a while
its $unc$one of the quickest
it
once it was reallowed
i think it was outlawed for a while by the supreme court or the interpretation of the constitution
and it seems like everybody stopped
and then once they sort of reallowed it $unc$texas was $unc$one of the first to actually implement it again
really
they do it by lethal injection
uh-huh
im originally from $unc$kansas
and in $unc$kansas also they almost immediately put back capital punishment
and there they do it by hanging
wow
still they have
i still remember the movie in cold blood
i dont know if youve ever
im sure youre familiar with it
but have you seen the movie
i havent
no
yeah
that way
and they do it that way
yeah
they show it
not
the movie was made in like $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty-two or something like that
huh
and so its not particularly graphic
but on the other hand its fairly impressive to watch them walk into the room with gallows
its kind of a barn like structure
wow
i think theyre there
i think that capital punishment is in $unc$utah also
im not really familiar
is that right
are you there in school
yeah
i am
yeah
but i think they d-
a long time ago i remember my dad was telling me this i think that they do it by like a bunch of men have guns
and $unc$one of them has the real gun in it
uh-huh
has a
yeah
so they dont know who killed
has a real bullets
and the rest of them have blanks
right
yeah
i certainly wouldnt want to be the executioner
i know that
yeah
no
ive always said that if i had to kill and clean and do my own meat i think id become a vegetarian
i know
as long as youre sort of safely removed from it it seems not so bad i guess
okay
all right
go ahead
what kind of car would i want to buy
yeah
i dont know
the question is would i want to buy
or would i probably actually buy
may be $unc$two different things
if you had all the money in the world or something
if i had all the money i wanted then thats whole different matter
no
in that case i dont know
my dream car for years was a $unc$porsche $unc$turbo
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i dont know if id want $unc$one of those now
really
of course i would want $unc$one if somebody was given to me
yeah
but i maybe would buy a $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w or even a $unc$volvo
uh-huh
what do you have now
ive got a $unc$dodge $unc$daytona
uh-huh
its actually the first car we ever bought new
really
yeah
i have
my car is the first one we ever bought new too
uh-huh
but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
uh-huh
yeah
me too
what car do you drive
what is it
mine is a $unc$honda $unc$accord
uh-huh
we almost bought $unc$one of those
do you like it
yeah
i do
and its funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling
and i
some of the cars that i got were like the $unc$toyota $unc$camry and the $unc$nissan $unc$maxima and some of the competitors
uh-huh
and i dont like them as well except it wasnt really a fair comparison because those were automatics
and mine is a standard
yeah
and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better
uh-huh
it had a lot more pickup and everything
yeah
you get a little more control over when its doing the things its doing
uh-huh
yeah
what rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars
usually $unc$avis
to what $unc$avis
$unc$avis
really
yeah
huh
i guess
its just because were on
i think of it
im not sure those are $unc$avis or not
but we have corporate contracts with the various companies
i see
uh-huh
so it depends on your destination too
right
kind of strange
you work for a big company then
work for $unc$t $unc$i which is how i heard about this
$unc$t $unc$i i see
uh-huh
but yeah
i dont know
if i were to buy a car with the constraints of real money i probably would go with something like a $unc$honda $unc$accord
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe it would
$unc$one thing i really liked about the $unc$dodge $unc$daytona is the fact that they have this $unc$seven year warranty
really
and it really saved us some big money once
it did
yeah
they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time
my gosh
and the bill would have been over $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred dollars
and i had to pay $unc$twenty $unc$five for the
that was great
yeah
it was
thats unusual to hear
usually something breaks
you look at the warranty
and its excluded
we bought the extension and at the time we bought it it was like i dont know $unc$four $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty-five dollars or something extra
i see
okay
you got your moneys worth
yeah
we did
but we really debated at the beginning
and of course im glad i did it
yeah
yeah
that is good
but we still have $unc$three years left on it
yeah
ive been lucky
mine hasnt had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
no
but i was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light
bumper
oh
it didnt actually dent the car or anything
so it cost me $unc$twenty-five bucks to replace that
that was good
and the store will pay for it anyway
are you
so no big deal
uh-huh
if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another $unc$accord
i probably wouldnt just because i already have $unc$one
uh-huh
but if i had to make the choice again im perfectly happy with what i decided although we did just buy another car
uh-huh
and thats a $unc$legend
yeah
those are nice
but its a used one
uh-huh
and my husband has really wanted $unc$one for a long time
and the fact that this car that i have has performed so well
and before that i also had an $unc$accord
it was a real old one
uh-huh
and i bought that used
i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that
and it served me real well too
uh-huh
so hes been impressed with all the $unc$honda cars
right
and
yeah
my sister drives $unc$one
she drives a i dont know is it $unc$legend
uh-huh
its a
im not certain
but shes liked it
yeah
but i have never had
and we
in fact what im driving right now
we only had $unc$one car for a long time
and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth $unc$four miles to work and back kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so i bought a used $unc$yugo just to be a little car that i could care less about
uh-huh
yeah
how did it go for you
its worked
hasnt left you stranded
thats exactly what it is
its a cheap little car just to go run around town in
yeah
i know
yeah
and its actually kind of fun to drive
i
getting back in the $unc$daytona now i almost dont like it
really
its too mushy
and its an automatic
and
thats what my husband thinks about my car now that hes had the $unc$legend
its too
the steering
its windy
you feel like youre in a boat or something
its kind of
i cant drive that
the $unc$legend its just so huge
oh
i dont like it
and its so
so what kind of home repair work have you done
done a little repair on the shingles on the roof recently
weve had a lot of wind around here
been pulling them up or just loosening them until the rain came in
yes
it looks like im going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak
are you in the section of $unc$texas thats been getting so much rain
weve been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around $unc$san $unc$antonio
but im right
planos just north of $unc$dallas
okay
and there are parts of downtown or near downtown $unc$dallas that are under water right now i guess
i saw on the news
yeah
but youre probably about halfway across the state from $unc$san $unc$antonio though arent you
were north and about i dont know $unc$eighty to a $unc$hundred miles south of the $unc$oklahoma line i guess
yeah
yeah
okay
but youre still getting a good bit of the rain though
we did have a little bit of rain yesterday
so far we havent had any today
and i suppose that means i should be getting up there to look at that shingle
but i had something else planned today
yeah
so i guess ill let it go awhile
yeah
is it asphalt shingles
or
theyre
no
theyre wood shake
ooh
that should be a lot of fun
yeah
did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them
no
i
as a matter of fact weve never had a leak actually yet
now this
we just bought the house last year
and just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles
so ive just recently had to start looking at it myself
yeah
so its a small problem so far
but i guess you just have to keep on top of it
what kind of roof do you have
were in campus apartment buildings with flat top
then you dont have to do too much with it
not too much
theyre just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs
uh-huh
have you got pretty well pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep
its pretty steep
parts of it are steeper than others
what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal
you wear shoes with good traction and try to remember where you are at all times
yeah
i imagine
and remember to yell $unc$geronimo if all else fails
yeah
yeah
that would be just too much of a fall for me
have you been
was the house reasonably new
or you been doing some remodeling work on it
its actually just $unc$twelve years old now
thats pretty new house yet
yeah
it
this part of the country
they say that when the house is $unc$fifteen its already old
but just take good care of it
yeah
thing is
the main thing that weve had with this house recently has been some squirming i call it of the foundation
were just on a concrete slab
yeah
but the soil right under this is a clay
and it
its settling unevenly
depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
and of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer
yeah
uh-huh
and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping
uh-huh
but anytime theres a change in the weather like drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors
that sounds like a lot of fun
usually what you do is just wait until you think its stopped
and then you patch them up
what is it stucco walls or
its all drywall
drywall
i think with
wood framing
yeah
right
okay
but somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks
i dont know quite how that works
maybe it isnt drywall
i dont really know
they plastered over drywall
yeah
i think it is
i remember my parents home is drywalled and then almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look
i expect thats what it is
yeah
and made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall
yeah
i think thats the way this is done
fortunately we havent had any real big holes in it yet
so i
yeah
thats good
yeah
yeah
that would be terribly exasperating to have the slab floor swelling and giving like that
yes
the previous owner had a major problem with it because probably a variety of things
his neighbor used
return anything
really the only things that i have returned have not been faulty
its been because of the size or some problem like that
right
i really havent had to return things because they didnt perform the way they were supposed to
most the time they have a pretty good guarantee
yeah
the only thing ive had lately is my kids got all these $unc$barbie kind of toys for $unc$christmas
and it takes them less than a day
and theyre broken in $unc$one way or another
but i dont know if thats just kids or if thats
maybe those type of products should be for older kids
uh-huh
what age are your children
i have a $unc$five and a half and a $unc$three and a half year old that play with them
uh-huh
and i dont think theyre unduly rough
but maybe they are
i dont know
but a lot of the little $unc$barbie sets they come with real little pieces
and theyre easily lost and easily broken
but
uh-huh
my daughter is $unc$twenty-one now
so its been a while since weve had $unc$barbie things
its been a while since theyve gone through the $unc$barbie stuff
but we did have $unc$barbies and things
and there
seems to me that became a craze when she was already third fourth fifth grade
right
so she wasnt in it for very long before she was out of it
but i dont remember her breaking a lot of stuff
dont remember her breaking
no
i dont
but i also dont remember lots of little pieces
theyve got so many different things with it now
thats $unc$one thing theyve got
theyve got every type of imaginable
camping on the beach and all of these come with tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses
and
goodness
my $unc$three and a half year old has wanted this $unc$ken doll
and so i finally got her a $unc$ken doll
and less than a week later the arm was broken
dear
but they were real good about replacing it
thats $unc$one nice thing is theyre real good about replacing it
i guess if theyll replace them then they assume they shouldnt have broken
right
those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
and
any direction
shes not that big of a girl that i think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could
uh-huh
right
yeah
the main thing that they had when my daughter was playing with $unc$barbies was just clothes
yes
that was about it
that was about it
uh-huh
and the $unc$barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
but
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics
my children are $unc$twenty-one and $unc$twenty-five and $unc$twenty-eight
is that right
uh-huh
and
do you see that theres a big problem with electronic things
no
not really
we havent had that much problem with things that we have bought
they seem to last
in fact when they offer us extended warranties we dont buy them because we find we dont need them
dont buy them because you dont need them
yes
and it seems like its just an added tack on
plus a lot of the credit cards now will guarantee
if you purchase on your credit card then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesnt work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time
yeah
so it seems like its a waste of money
yes
you almost assume if youre going to have problems with it its usually before that warranty would expire
any
the first one
uh-huh
and on a recliner once i bought an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that
and i never used it
you never even needed it
and so it seems ridiculous
and washers and dryers and things like that ive never had $unc$one go out
in fact they usually
when they do go out its either something my husband can buy the part and fix
and we dont even have a repairman come
or it means its old enough that its time to replace the whole thing
its time to replace it
uh-huh
yes
so
i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really
i do too
a lot of it
when we first married we bought $unc$one on our t v
and that theres
after the first $unc$five years
and it was ridiculous
uh-huh
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too
yes
theyre a pretty healthy price
and youre trying to think maybe ill need this
you always think gosh if i say no then i wont
uh-huh
but
my husband finally just put his foot down
i dont know
and he said were not going to buy any of these anymore
and if it goes out
you probably got your worth out of it anyway
uh-huh
so we really have been fairly happy with things
but we take good care of things
and we dont run out and buy a lot of things either
and since our kids arent little anymore im not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken
yes
the little
you probably are real careful of the brands you buy
and when you do buy things you probably watch what type of
you look at the consumer guide
yes
and you go around
and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
what do you think about child care
my feelings on it is i wouldnt take a child to day-care you know
right
id wind up
just a baby-sitter in a home
probably find someone
how come you wouldnt take them to a day-care
just because of the
too many kids and i think too many infections and things coming in
yeah
they seem to pass a lot of
yeah
sicknesses and
i dont know
then all the things you hear about them
yeah
you kind of wonder whether or not
yeah
im sure theres some good ones
but i just
i dont think that i would
i took $unc$cammy to a
it was a preschool day-care type of thing
uh-huh
but i liked it some ways
and some ways i didnt
i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
yeah
yeah
and
how was it
i think they had $unc$two teachers
and i think there were $unc$twenty kids
but i only had her going $unc$two days
and most of the other kids were going more days
so that was probably my own fault that she didnt
oh
she went
$unc$one thing i noticed is just they were trying to teach her to write her name
and i didnt notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way not in a natural form
she did
yes
and i was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or tried to say look youre holding your
she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff
but she was
wrapping her arm all the way around
yes
yeah
and i hadnt worked with her on writing at all at that point
she was $unc$four or $unc$three
yeah
it was last year
and then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on
and i w-
like i said i didnt notice it till then because i hadnt worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that
oh
uh-huh
theyd never picked it out though
no
they never
or just never said anything
course like i said i took her $unc$two days a week
and maybe that was
my main reason for taking her was just social skills more than anything else
yeah
yeah
i felt she needed the s-
just i didnt feel like she was mature enough socially
yeah
and
$unc$one thing thats kind of different too though a preschool than taking a infant at a day-care where theyre taken care of
uh-huh
yeah
i think it would be hard to take them to people you dont know
preschools a different thing
but i think its hard to take kids to somebody you dont know unless you have awfully good references reliable people
yeah
yeah
i dont know
its so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
i think its hard to leave them
it is
it is
the older ones its not
you dont even really have any real worries because you know that theyll play with whoevers there
and they usually adapt pretty well
yeah
but
yeah
it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will
and you know kind of their schedules
and you know if theyre upset and that type of a deal
yeah
yeah
i dont know how people that have young kids working work full time do it really without being stressed out all the time
i think its
i dont know
then on the other hand i think its harder to stay home in some regards
its hard to always keep yourself feeling like youre doing something productive
and at the end of the day your house still feels like its a mess
and you havent got anything done
and
yeah
what am i going to fix for supper
yeah
it is
yeah
its kind of hard to always feel gosh
is this important what im doing
and
yeah
the work never ends
no
thats for sure
no
it doesnt
so
but probably people that take them to preschools and day-cares full time
they would i dont know probably just feel different
i just think it would be hard to do that full time
i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that
are they driving the baby-sitter crazy
and
uh-huh
or is everything okay
okay
yeah
$unc$donna you said you have $unc$three children
what kinds of activities do you spend with them
is it
okay
we have an $unc$eleven year old an $unc$eight year old and a $unc$three year old
and my husband lets see he coaches basketball with $unc$brian
uh-huh
so he spends time doing that with him planning and practicing outside
uh-huh
hes a real sports kind of person
so he plays tennis with the kids
we all kind of play tennis as a family
except the baby plays in the playground
uh-huh
we take turns with her
lets see
we have a computer
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer
lets what else we do
plus we watch a little t v together
we really dont watch i think as much t v as a lot of people
uh-huh
we dont have $unc$h $unc$b $unc$o
we do get the $unc$disney channel for the kids
uh-huh
my kids have a $unc$nintendo which they play
and my husband sometimes joins them with that
uh-huh
my little girl $unc$jennifer likes to do crafty things
and ill take some time and do that with her
and of course we always read a bedtime story at night
and even the older kids sometimes sit down and will join in and listen to a story
im basically the story person because my husband doesnt have
uh-huh
he gets home from work late or whatever
and once in a while hell read the story to little one
but thats basically my job
yeah
so do you find it difficult to find time
or is it pretty natural
it is hard because at the end of your day you want time for yourself
uh-huh
yeah
and it
and thats kind of cutting into your time
yeah
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at $unc$ten which really is late
uh-huh
but on school nights the $unc$two older ones get to bed about $unc$nine
they go upstairs at $unc$nine
and now this weekend well have a baby-sitter come
and my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home probably not too late
uh-huh
maybe $unc$brian will still be up and spend some time with him
but its really hard
you have to be a very unselfish person to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
yeah
yeah
do you work during the day
no
i dont work
last year i had a little part time job in a private high school tutoring high school students with learning disabilities
uh-huh
that was $unc$two days a week
and even just those $unc$two days just seemed like it was a lot
i dont know how
i admire people that can do it all
yeah
but with $unc$three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept it is hard
yeah
i can imagine
yeah
even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything
uh-huh
and thats another thing
ill take $unc$one of the kids with me grocery shopping usually on the weekend
and thats kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son
and theyll be my helper
and then theyll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out
so i try to do things like that
yeah
but its
yeah
and then of course they have a pretty busy social calendar too
uh-huh
you fit it in with all that
yeah
what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general in $unc$america
i think a lot of people set their kids in front of the t v and $unc$h $unc$b $unc$o and rent movies and kind of leave them to their own means
uh-huh
yeah
i think its very easy to fall into that trap
and im not totally innocent of that because theres times when you just stay here watch a tape
uh-huh
yeah
but i think different parts of the country
i think in $unc$plano and maybe this area in $unc$texas theres a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids
people are real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and
uh-huh
thats good
but
yeah
yeah
families are facing a challenge
i know that with
what
im a newlywed
and were thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years
uh-huh
and
uh-huh
and its very hard because when you get used to $unc$two salaries its very hard to cut back to $unc$one
yeah
but if you have the type of job
i have a friend thats a nurse
and she can pick her hours
and
uh-huh
thats a great career
i wish i would have gone into nursing
yeah
because she has such a flexible schedule
but its very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once
uh-huh
yeah
but i do feel like its important that you make the time for children because
i think its a big responsibility
you just dont have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single
yeah
yeah
when you have children you have to say now this is different
and you do have to give things up
i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child at least for the first $unc$two years of their lives if you can possibly swing it
because they
do you have kids
yeah
i got $unc$three
how about yourself
we have $unc$two and another one on the way
you have got young children then
yeah
we do
we have a $unc$six year old
he is oldest
and then our baby will be a year on $unc$monday
my goodness
that is great
yeah
what kind of mix do you have
a boy and a girl
$unc$two boys
$unc$two boys
$unc$two boys
yeah
do you know what is on the way yet
are you
no
i am just about $unc$three months
and i dont think we really even want to find out
i do not blame you
we like surprises
so we will take either
we have got $unc$two boys and a girl also
we have got $unc$two boys and a girl
and does it
are the $unc$two boys first
yes
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time
maybe
we kind of like our boys though too
so
our boys he is in graduate school at $unc$a and $unc$m
he is in the $unc$navy
he is a lieutenant in the $unc$navy
and the $unc$navy is sending him for his $unc$masters in $unc$ocean $unc$engineering
my goodness
and we have got another boy that is out in $unc$maryland
he is a wildlife biologist
and our girl is $unc$thirteen
she is in the seventh grade
so we have got still all sorts of good activities since
yeah
you kind of got a span there
what do you do with your seventh grader
she is into a little bit of everything
she loves riding horses
so she goes out riding as much as she can
do you have horses
no
just she knows people that does
that
yeah
but maybe that riding place that is north of town that she goes to
she rides $unc$english and does jumping takes lesson and all that kind of stuff
does she
oh
she must really like them
yeah
she is into
she plays the flute in the band and the piccolo
and she is into this odyssey of the mind thing which takes a lot of time for
it
a
what they call peace group
i dont know if you have gotten into that with your kids
but that is where the kind of
it is a program for advanced kids
advanced
yeah
yeah
i have heard about it
our little boy is in the first grade
and i taught school for $unc$six years
okay
so i do know about that program
and
my wife is involved
and she kind of heads that up for these kids
and last year they got the state level
they did not win that
but they got $unc$one local and $unc$one region
and they got a new mix of kids this time
so it keeps them busy
uh-huh
it keeps them busy
yeah
i bet
so does she go actually out into a different classroom with other kids that are involved in this
yes
but they have
you probably know a peace group that are advanced type that they are special classes for peace classes
i think that this happens to be
yeah
history is what their peace class is this year
so
uh-huh
she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it
how neat
so yeah
challenging
yeah
oh
always something to do
as far as our activities we are kind of on a different level here
but my
you will get to different levels
i guarantee it
yeah
yeah
my husband is going to take our $unc$six year old to the monster truck show tonight
okay
they like to
that will be fun
both boy things
yeah
yeah
yeah
but we do not have any real
we dont really ski
we have not taken our kids skiing or anything
of course the baby is young
but
got to wait a couple years
yeah
yeah
sledding that is what you have got to do
tobogganing
the what
you have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them
yeah
we have done that
in fact he just goes right out here
we have got quite a bit of snow
last week we got a lot
you are welcome to keep that
yeah
you would like that huh
i grew up in $unc$wisconsin
i had plenty of snow
and when i was a kid
oh
and we have lived here about $unc$seventeen years
but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all of that kind of stuff
yeah
it is fun really
it is fun
as long as you do not have to drive in it
yeah
i
no
i do not like that
i
really it makes me nervous
yeah
i had plenty of snow to last me forever
i dont care if i ever see any
i dont care if i ever see it
but keep it off of here
yeah
yeah
i dont mind it
but the winter gets long
yes
i get ready that
come about this time of year i am kind of ready for it to start getting spring
and it is too early yet
you have got $unc$five months before you will see that
yeah
we do
we have had a few early springs though in the last few years
they have not been too bad
come about $unc$march it gets a lot nicer
yeah
out oldest son when
okay
you probably more up on this subject than i am
but the roles that women have played in the last couple of generations
that
right
theyve entered the work force more since $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two is when they started
you bet
and i think that that is very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women
you bet
where ive noticed it more i think is
im a traveling salesperson
and i have traveled most of my life
and i know just especially in the last $unc$ten years and really in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling
right
as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers
i sell sporting goods
and even in our industry there was really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell
and even in the last $unc$five or $unc$six years boy we see more and more women being involved
and its a credit to them as far as how theyre doing things
yeah
the
you see more of them leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
you bet
i have a club that i belong to on $unc$tuesday that
$unc$one of the girls travels quite extensively
and she says my children have $unc$two parents
why not
you bet
thats sort of neat
so i think thats a change
and i think thats a change youre going to be seeing more of in the future people having that kind of attitude that the fathers going to take more active role in child rearing
sure
i think its the age old thing
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or youll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that women are paid less than men
and theyre or carrying the same job responsibility
right
and thats a very true statement
and it shouldnt be that way
no
that i think will change in the near future also
i hope so
a-
its been changing
its been evolving
but theres still an inequality in the work forces or jobs
absolutely
its
ive
and you hear some people say
hes a man
he needs that salary
right
yeah
they forget
also i think a good argument for that is in the area of politics
if a
a woman $unc$congressman im sure makes as much as a man $unc$congressman and the same as a senator or whatever
right
so they certainly deserve it all the way
but i guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as i mentioned was just in traveling
you see more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and going
and going
yeah
uh-huh
and i expect youre right in regards to having $unc$two parents now
thats a good statement
and i think if
in the future its even going to be more noticeable and more significant
right
yeah
i think it will be
i
another thing i read too the other day
this is not just for working women
but how much theyre out there i guess is
the car designers are starting to design cars with women in mind because in the past the male bought the cars
but now theyre showing that $unc$fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases and that they are looking for different things in the car
wow
the man is looking in the engine
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel can her makeup come off the upholstery
you bet
good point
and if theyre out there buying that many cars then theres that many out that are self sufficient and mobile and working
right now im self employed
and my wifes always worked
shes a schoolteacher
but for
she started working
and then when i first started my business
she was selling real estate at the time
and hers was the only income we had for $unc$three or $unc$four months
so
right
she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business
and she still works everyday
so
yeah
we all do
you bet
i just happen to be off today
uh-oh
i work too
enjoying it
what kind of work do you do
im a nurse
good
and i work at $unc$medical $unc$treatment $unc$center which is at $unc$jupiter and $unc$arapaho
right
married
no
yeah
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
i dont know
im kind of out of things
you see the old cigarette ads about youve come a long way
youve come a long way baby
baby
right
and
right
you think about this when it comes to a subject like that
and its really true
women have come a long way
and
what do you think in terms of benefits
personally i think
of course im sure were familiar with the exact same benefit package
and i think that weve probably got $unc$one of the best around
besides they tend to offer adequate vacation i guess
and the paid time off is wonderful
and $unc$one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the $unc$coda plan that is offered
and i think that is just a fabulous one
so i dont know if you participate in that or not
but
absolutely
isnt it great
its just a miracle how fast that adds up
i have to agree with that
i was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for the system to find a respondent
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed
and i suspect that thats probably true for everyone
yeah
when i was much younger it was less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits
but as i grow older and my family grows the medical benefits are more important
and the retirement is more important
i had never really thought of it that way
but i guess thats true
im still young enough that the vacations real important to me
and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing
but as a matter of fact i just celebrated my fifth year at $unc$t $unc$i the end of last month and kind of started looking through the book because of that
now that im a $unc$hundred percent vested you kind of look through the book and see what does that mean and what is the pension all about
and when youre in your
im only in my late twenties now
so you tend not to think about retirement
but its
i guess now is the time to think about it
so $unc$does $unc$t $unc$i have a pretty good retirement package do you think
i think they have $unc$one that we need to recognize that were going to have to supplement ourselves
yeah
and thats certainly $unc$one of the reasons im sure that theyve begun the $unc$coda plan
uh-huh
its certainly a supplemental way
uh-huh
and i suppose maybe in your instance if youre started with $unc$t $unc$i in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until youre $unc$sixty-five then youll have a very good retirement plan
right
but i had another career first and then came to $unc$t $unc$i a little later
uh-huh
so its not
all by itself it wont be adequate for my situation
its not going to build up quite enough
yeah
so i have to find a way to supplement that
yeah
they seem to make it so easy to save
$unc$one of the things that were doing which is probably the worst investment in the world
but ive got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check
and its probably not a great investment
but if i wasnt doing that the money wouldnt be being saved anyway
i kind of have to trade off
if you never see it you dont spend it
and its
i understand though
it
yeah
believe me i do that myself
do you
yeah
and i disagree with you
i dont think its the worst investment in the world
do you really not
i debate about whether its really good or not
its in terms of guaranteed return on investment
and maybe you dont start looking for that word guaranteed until later
yeah
yeah
its shown a history that sure beats anything else over many many years
yeah
thats true
thats very true
we went and did a thing through $unc$i $unc$b $unc$s which is a financial consultant type thing here in $unc$dallas
and $unc$one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was
they work up this whole big profile for you all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
and then $unc$one of the things that we talked about with her was the need to save for our sons education
we have a $unc$two year old
and we cant start saving for college when hes $unc$sixteen
we have to do that now
and they have a way that they can figure what
and hes $unc$two now
in $unc$sixteen years when hes ready to go to college this is how much itll cost
and its just really scary the thought of how much its going to
what it costs now is ridiculous
what its going to cost $unc$sixteen years from now is just really scary
and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save between $unc$fifteen and $unc$seventeen $unc$hundred dollars a year at a $unc$six percent interest rate to be able to have money for his college
and thats exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is about $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred dollars a year
so i guess it
in that way at least we know that thats taken care of
we can worry about other things
so
i understand that approach
yeah
thats exactly whats happening in my family
yeah
is it really
yeah
except that mine are a little bit older
and ive shown them the numbers and said this is whats going to be available
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while youre there
uh-huh
you better make sure that youve got a scholarship
thats right
thats right
thats what she said to us
she said now do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college
and our answer was that we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college
and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend
and that was kind of our view on it
it just costs too much
you just cant do it
so i dont know
its
i dont
it just amazing
it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen years
i just dont know how anybodys going to do it
and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them
i have an $unc$eleven year old daughter now whos saying gee $unc$dad i want to be an allergist
goodness
and i said thats wonderful
i applaud that
let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
yeah
yeah
exactly
and then her little brothers only $unc$two years behind
exactly
and he says i dont know
i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian
and i said thats great
let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
thats right
thats right
$unc$t $unc$i offers some good stuff
and then i think theres some negatives
but theres going to be some negatives anywhere no matter where you go
i have all
this is the first really large company ive worked for ive
always been involved in little small privately owned firms
and so ive never had the big benefit package
so i really dont know how to compare it to other big companies
when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what they offered
so ive been real pleased
thats fantastic
yeah
and on whole i would say that theyre equal to most of our competitors
think so
i can see some potential changes that probably would not cost very much but might make things a little easier such as offering a smorgasbord having a larger variety of benefits
uh-huh
but heres the amount that $unc$t $unc$i is going to pay for it
yeah
yeah
and you can pick what you want
and yeah
now its up to you
its menu selection so to speak
right
that sounds really good
i read a thing
i dont even remember if it was in the $unc$dallasite or the $unc$insite one about companies allowing you
and they said that $unc$t $unc$i was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
if youve been there under $unc$five years you get $unc$two weeks of vacation
but thats really not enough
and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay im going to want an extra $unc$five days this year
and theyll take a set amount out of each paycheck
and theyre deducting it all along
so you can have an extra $unc$five days off and be paid for them at the time
youre really not being paid for them
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket
but its coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once
so that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in
and $unc$t $unc$i said that they were looking into something like that
so
i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i dont believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
true
true
and i would certainly support something like $unc$four to $unc$one or $unc$five to $unc$one
or maybe they want to get generous and make it $unc$three to $unc$one as a repayment for every $unc$three to $unc$five days that i work overtime there they should give me $unc$one day
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
but it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate thats running in each department
uh-huh
and yeah
and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person
and i see a lot of differences from $unc$one group to the next about who gets it and who doesnt get it
and thats that way with a lot of things there
it seems like it depends on what group you happen to be in what youre going to get and what youre not going to get
so
thats for sure
which is the same
but then its probably that way anywhere
thats
im sure personalities always come into play
uh-huh
just in this size of organization
our community doesnt really have any organized recycling drive
where do you live
i live in $unc$san $unc$antonio
$unc$san $unc$antonio!
uh-huh
i live in $unc$garland
and were just beginning to
we just built a real big recycling center that recycles everything imaginable
uh-huh
but as far as trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing theyre testing that
uh-huh
so theyre really not full force into it
but theyre trying
so were attempting it
but i wish we could do more
yeah
theres been no emphasis on recycling at all in $unc$san $unc$antonio
i used to work for the power company here
and there was discussion for a while about building a garbage burning electric generation plant
uh-huh
but it just wasnt cost effective at the time
oh
and theres little recycling trucks and things throughout the city
but there isnt any advertising campaign
theres just not any push to recycle
i recycle my newspapers and my aluminum stuff
right
thats what i do
but they make it as hard as possible
its not very convenient to do
right
when they put centers and stuff like that
uh-huh
yeah
we have those which i think is $unc$one of the best things is those cash for cans
i dont know if you all have those things around
yes
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because theyre in almost every shopping center
and you can just stop by
now everything else like the paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers
but for aluminum thats real nice
uh-huh
and i started doing that at work
i put out a trash can for people to put their aluminum cans in
uh-huh
and thats really helped a lot
everybodys pitched in
and it doesnt bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
yeah
yeah
so i really like that
but people are really concerned
its just that sometimes its not the right people which is really sad because i wish we would do more
yeah
at work we started all the recycling stuff
theyre really trying
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year
yes
and that really started a lot of stuff off
but sometimes it dwindles down
yeah
where i work now we recycle all the computer paper
thats good
but thats about the extent of it
thats
at least your trying something
yeah
yeah
its just
it would be nice if it could be more
and im sure that the driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so
do you really
we sell the paper back to a paper manufacturing company
thats a neat idea
it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think
i
not by much but it does defray it some
right
enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building
thats really good
at least theyre trying
yeah
yeah
i know a lot of companies that waste so much that
im even trying
that was $unc$one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building and they were just used $unc$one time and thrown in the dumpster
yes
and i thought i dont understand this
yeah
were trying to cut cost and everything like that and recycle and all that stuff
and here we are wasting
and i dont understand sometimes the logic behind it
the last time someone moved offices in my building
and the properties people came in with the good cardboard boxes
not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around
uh-huh
i took several home because im moving pretty soon
and theyre good boxes
thats exactly what i did
and they were just going to throw them away
exactly what i did exactly
yeah
because i didnt want to waste that
huh-uh
and its hard enough to find good packing boxes
right
and these boxes are
you can unfold them
right
so they dont take up much storage space
exactly right
thats very good
yeah
yeah
i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about $unc$two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away
so
right
right
i thought i was doing them a favor by taking them
i found about $unc$nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes that were in the dumpsters
yeah
gosh
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when these are perfect
uh-huh
so
yeah
the ones at the grocery store half the time theyve pulled the lid off
so you cant use it anyway
right
right
right
those
and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
uh-huh
right
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes
thats exactly what i do
those are perfect boxes to put files in
uh-huh
theyre good for storage and stuff like that
thats what i do with a lot of my daughters things is ill store her out dated or out of season clothes in them
and theyre just perfect
what ive done in the past
i dont have any now
but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
uh-huh
and you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them even
and they look just as good
thats a smart idea
uh-huh
yeah
i think ill have to try that
thats really cute
yeah
its cheaper than going and buying the kind at $unc$target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
theyre the exact same thing
thats all they are
they just made them look fancy
uh-huh
yeah
you saved me some money
and youre recycling
yeah
thats neat
do you all have
we have places that pay for paper to recycle
i know you do yours at work
but for newspaper
uh-huh
but ours are real hard to find
thats the $unc$one thing that really discourages me
i recycle paper
but they
its almost like they dont want the paper because they dont pay at all
theyre real hard to find the places that pay
and thats really discouraging
i just go ahead and take it to the regular place where they just accept it
but i think they should
yeah
if they want people to recycle i think its
the aluminum
it gets people doing it
you dont have to pay them a lot
yeah
i live near a $unc$walmart
and theres a big huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front
in fact i think theres $unc$two of them that have several openings
uh-huh
and its for recycling
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category
uh-huh
i dont
maybe theres $unc$two for aluminum
and you dont get paid
but its real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
thats good
yeah
i
the $unc$one thing i dont like about the newspaper also is
at work we have $unc$two different trash cans at your desk
you have $unc$one for paper and $unc$one for just your normal trash
uh-huh
but in the paper $unc$one you have to separate
you have to make sure you dont throw away any of the slick paper like magazines
uh-huh
you cant throw any of that away
and you cant throw certain file type things away
and i just think its such a hassle
it seems like it would be easy to take it all
i dont know
of course i dont know all that about recycling
so it probably is a hassle
uh-huh
but i do get tired of having to separate paper
uh-huh
it gets to be
i guess you have to make it a habit
you have to get so used to doing it that its a habit
right
right
and we had a write up in our paper this last time at work about
they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash
and every other day they do your recycling trash
uh-huh
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had dumped all the trash in the same bin
oh
and when they were questioned about it they said were running late
or we didnt have time to do those bins or something
and thats real discouraging thinking youre sitting there working to separate it
and then they
and someone else isnt going to take the time to put it in $unc$two separate bags
right
right
so theyre really trying to start keeping an eye out for those
talking to the people again about
separate them
because that is discouraging when you do that
it was hard to get used to those $unc$two different trash cans
uh-huh
but luckily that will all get straightened out
and theyll start separating them
because i dont mind doing that
i feel like im doing something for the community when im doing that
yeah
but
ive enjoyed talking to you
you too
i thank you
bye
bye
bye
okay
where to start
i havent had that much of course
i just heard
but i havent had that much time to think about it either
i guess the biggest thing i find is the financial aspects particularly the ability of people to access your financial records or for example your credit rating almost at will
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats true
i didnt think about that
and of course flying
using your $unc$social $unc$security number of course permits people to do that
uh-huh
and almost anything you do now a $unc$social $unc$security number is required
uh-huh
and of course theres another aspect of this too in terms of invasion of privacy
i just thought about it
being a professional of course you probably belong to $unc$one or more professional organizations
and that is that
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think is an invasion of privacy
uh-huh
i agree
yes
i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name
and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires
its funny because i was in the process of filling $unc$one out when i decided i would make this phone call
but i havent got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything
but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i just have a real hard time doing that
and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and t v and v c r
and you hate to send something off with your name and address
and what types of things do you own
and what kind of money do you make
and you wonder whos going to get ahold of this and think thats a nice place to go rob
and not only that it opens you to phone solicitations for a variety of things from
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
i got $unc$one tonight about $unc$six $unc$thirty when i sat down to eat dinner
carpet cleaning
ive had them for carpet cleaning
ive had them of course for real estate investments
uh-huh
you get please send in this particular card and you get a free trip or something along those lines
right
and so that bothers me because of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers particularly soliciting
uh-huh
so having your
and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls
uh-huh
they just start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers
but some of them are sold
and i know you
talking about mailing lists the
i
there is $unc$one particular group to which i belong
and for some
reason they have $unc$three different names for me
the address is the same my office address
uh-huh
but they have $unc$one under my first name $unc$james
they have $unc$one under my first name and middle initial
uh-huh
then they have a third one under just my $unc$two initials
uh-huh
and i get mail here at home under each of those names
uh-huh
no
so i know that they have sold their mailing list
right
and i think those $unc$two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy
yeah
and i cant really think of anything else offhand that
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst
its $unc$one thing to get junk mail because you can just put it right in the trash
but its the phone calls
and usually when they call you its going to be right when you sit down to dinner because they pretty much know that youre at work all day
and they call you right when youve just gotten home from work
the last thing you want is a phone call unless its something halfway enjoyable
but if its a salesperson its just something you dont want to have to mess with
and ive gotten a lot of them lately
or ill
sometimes i come home from work
and theres a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
and im just assuming its probably a salesman that called during the day
and i wasnt home
and theyll probably call me up and call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on
but i find that very annoying the mail stuff
uh-huh
yeah
its kind of irritating
but its not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity to talk and see whats going on and all those things
even if friends call it irritates me
uh-huh
yeah
so i try to
actually during that period of time usually from $unc$six oclock or $unc$six $unc$thirty whenever i get home until $unc$eight or so i will shut off the phone
uh-huh
and my daughter gets irate when i do that because shes a teenager
uh-huh
oh
so shell i might get an important phone call
so i guess those $unc$three things are the most irritating to me
uh-huh
i agree with the phone too in that im single
but when i come home from work theres times i need to pay bills
i need to balance my checking account
i need to do all kinds of different things like that
and even though its friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time
i need to get things done
and the phone ringing bothers me
but thats where answering machines are nice because if its really important theyll leave a message
and i can call them back
thats right
but at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in
sometimes i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it really does annoy me
and if ive had a lot of phone calls during the day occasionally when we have
this past week
we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system
and phone rings like crazy
and you come home
and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone
and if its some salesman that just makes it even that much worse
and it just
i get to where i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone
but now with this thing im participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if its the switchboard or if its somebody calling that you really dont want to talk on the phone
now we have a voice mail system at the office
uh-huh
what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that i do not have to have a ring at all if i want to do that
uh-huh
uh-huh
a ring at all
thats an idea
right
or i will just let the phone ring $unc$three or $unc$four times and know that it will forward to the office
uh-huh
and so it makes it convenient
but at the office when i
on our system and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service
yeah
ours is that way too
and when i want to be not bothered during the day thats exactly what i do
uh-huh
and so
yours is probably the same as ours
its $unc$tigon
isnt $unc$tigon part of $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e or $unc$vice $unc$versa or something like that
seems i read
yeah
$unc$tigon is part of $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e
okay
okay
thats it
that $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e had purchased $unc$tigon
and
yeah
thats what we have
except we call it $unc$aspen
$unc$aspen
yes
and we
i couldnt remember in $unc$tigon had purchased $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e phone mail services or if $unc$g $unc$t $unc$e had purchased $unc$tigon
i knew there was some type of a tie in there
i remember reading in the paper a few months back
but
yeah
$unc$g $unc$t $unc$e purchased $unc$tigon
okay
and so we had been using the $unc$aspen service before they purchased $unc$tigon
uh-huh
so i imagine we will be shifting over to that service in a while as soon as we determine what were going to do with $unc$contel after we bought $unc$contel
uh-huh
uh-huh
no
yeah
$unc$dana i think we have probably conversed long enough
i think we did
thats good
all right
i didnt think we could go too far on this privacy thing
but i guess its close enough
thank you for calling
i enjoyed talking to you
sure good talking to you $unc$jim
all right
bye-bye
take care
okay
capital punishment
i honestly dont feel like its strict enough in my opinion
in the way that its applied or its applied at all
uh-huh
applied at all
so i
how do you feel that it should be applied
i just feel like theres a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets
and that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
yes
yes
not getting paroled lets say in so many years
yeah
if your going to sentence somebody lets say $unc$twenty years let them stay $unc$twenty years
thats
i agree with that completely
i know we dont have enough prisons
but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people
there has
thats right
because if they turn around they get away with it
and they get away with it
and they get away with it
and then they do something worse
uh-huh
and they get a slap on the wrist
they get $unc$thirty days in jail
yeah
yeah
and they final get up to where they kill somebody else
and they go through $unc$fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
uh-huh
thats right
thats honestly right
and its
they certainly are living at our expense
they sure are just because some innocent person can really
i didnt
it seems like really a rough time
yeah
im not saying innocent person
lets say someone wrote a hot check for instance
when they go to prison it really seem like its a rough time for them
uh-huh
hes just there to serve his time and get back out on the street
and be paroled and have served the sentence
yeah
thats what people face with that choice
$unc$one thing i really hate is they dont explain to the jurors in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
theyll sentence them to $unc$ninety years and say that its going to
uh-huh
that should be life
but instead in
given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life theyll give them $unc$ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in $unc$thirty years that
and less theyre out
uh-huh
if theyre even in that long
or they appeal
and then they get an appeal that says it was an unjust amount of time an extraordinary long length or something
time uh-huh
yes
i would just be
i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole
yeah
id like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent
i think people know that it doesnt
its not a deterrent right now because its not really effective
uh-huh
theres should be for this crime this is the penalty
you killed someone in cold blood or whatever
uh-huh
yeah
you get it back
yeah
this is whats going to happen
yeah
and it sounds horrible
it
i hear myself saying this
but i dont know what else to do with some of these people that are
yeah
but its
i know
because they let them back out again
and they do the same thing over and over again
same thing
yes
then they put them back in jail
and they get out
and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
yes
uh-huh
and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
uh-huh
and its like i said at our expense
a lot of people really doesnt think that much about it because it hasnt happened to them which it hasnt to me either
yes
thank goodness
but still it could
i know
you read about it in the paper every day somebody whos done this or that something really horrible
yes
uh-huh
and they just get away with it
and nothing happens
and as far as the other states i honestly dont know what their capital punishment is
i havent kept up anything like that
yeah
i think $unc$texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty
and i know $unc$california had it for a long time
and then they took it off the books
they repealed it
uh-huh
and people like $unc$charles $unc$manson and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are even though $unc$california has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes
the people who were there originally when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are in prison in quote for life and are now coming up for parole
some of them like $unc$manson whos come up
uh-huh
its been denied fortunately
but
yes
but still it came up though didnt it
yeah
the jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death
uh-huh
and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and $unc$one appeal the state of $unc$california revoked the law in the early seventies
and then they reinstated it later
but the penalty didnt go back
uh-huh
it seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side and isnt protecting the rest of the people
yes
the victim is really seems like left out in the cold more or less doesnt it
uh-huh
especially in things you pick up the paper
and you read you think oh my goodness
yeah
and the laws are all the rules
some of the things that would make sense to tell the jury that this guy has a prior criminal history where hes raped $unc$ten women
uh-huh
and then he gets up for this $unc$one trial
and they dont finds anything out about the facts that hes done this over and over and over again
uh-huh
and so they say this is
i dont know if they say its the first time offense or whatever
but they give him a lighter sentence thinking hes not a habitual criminal
or plead insanity
yeah
yeah
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
yes
they plead insanity
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then $unc$three years later theyre cured and let loose on society again
yes
i
it just doesnt make sense
its a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out
i
i know in the $unc$dallas metroplex area i dont go out hardly if i dont have to at night by myself
uh-huh
and i grew up in a smaller town in $unc$texas
and it wasnt that way when i was younger
uh-huh
like i said i live in a small place
we could go around
boy and
but even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid
but now im raising children
it really is
yes
ever
you cant even
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors $unc$three and $unc$four blocks sometimes as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time
uh-huh
and now i dont let my kids out of the front yard that i cant see them
see them
yeah
yeah
it really is
were probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon
uh-huh
but ive enjoyed talking to you
good talking to you too
bye
bye
bye
okay
bye-bye
okay
the term personal computer
i dont happen to have $unc$one at home
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here
a type of work station
yeah
yeah
its kind of a kluge that was pieced together to shall we say bypass the formal procurement process
and it works just fine
it says its a monochrome monitor $unc$panasonic printer no big deal
it does the things i need for it to do
is it a $unc$two $unc$eighty-six or $unc$three $unc$eighty-six base machine
no
its not even that
its $unc$eighty $unc$eighty-eight
i think thats about where it is
okay
what type of utilizations do you make of it
word processing obviously
yeah
i do that
i do some $unc$lotus on it do some $unc$samna some $unc$p $unc$f $unc$m nothing extremely complex
okay
i use them both here at work and at home
uh-huh
and i have $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m clones in both cases
yep
here at work i have the $unc$t $unc$i $unc$one $unc$thousand which is a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six base machine
yeah
i bet thats a pretty nice setup
yes
it is
unfortunately i need all of it
yep
for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend thats a third of a meg in beta size
wow
and i know that brings an $unc$eighty $unc$eighty-eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it
and he had a $unc$two $unc$eighty-six machine
yep
and it brought it to its knees just in the ability to handle
wow
and then i have a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six $unc$f $unc$x a $unc$sixteen bit machine at home
uh-huh
and im really pleased with it
uh-huh
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and database searches
sure
uh-huh
what ive gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
have you
yeah
yeah
to try to make them more effective and useful
right
have you been struggling along those lines
i seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software
when everyone was in $unc$samna i was still in $unc$p $unc$f $unc$m
and now that i finally become proficient in $unc$samna everybodys going to $unc$wordperfect
so i can never quite stay current with that
i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it
its
i used it on some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it
it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it
uh-huh
the
at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of a sudden you got a disc full error not a fun thing to try to recover from
oh
i can believe that
very frustrating
but again ive been dealing with large files both data and otherwise
that was a engineering spec on $unc$b $unc$two
you come here with the $unc$b level of specs
no
not really
im not that up be on that sort of thing
its just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what youre trying to build to $unc$one level down from assistant description
okay
okay
okay
it sounds like youre pretty much into computers
i sure need them
theres no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to try to do my job without them
i can believe that
its been interesting
yes
maybe youll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things
i think thats when you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have
when you start seeing what all they can do for you
yeah
of course needs and wants arent necessarily the same thing
i understand that
if needs and wants were the same id have a $unc$four $unc$eighty-six machine at home
i wo-
is that the newest thing now the $unc$four $unc$eighty-six
right
that must be a fairly recent release
thats
came out around the first of the year
okay
okay
because i had done capital packages for $unc$two eighty-sixes and $unc$three eighty-sixes
but i didnt know they had a $unc$four $unc$eighty-six just yet
it does a few more things than had been available before
uh-huh
yeah
but im not sure that its such a massive improvement
once you get passed $unc$thirty-three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the translation because you no longer can think that fast anyway
sure
yeah
okay
i enjoyed our discussion
i did too
and you have a good day
you do the same
bye-bye
bye
all right
ladies first
no
i dont find a lot of time to watch t v
and a lot of time i find it during the day when im rocking my little girl to sleep
so i watch a lot of reruns old shows like $unc$dick $unc$van $unc$dyke all those old crazy shows
yeah
i really enjoy watching $unc$andy $unc$griffith
some-
so your a homemaker
yeah
i guess thats the right term nowadays
yeah
i guess so
yeah
i am
i stay home with $unc$two kids
yeah
my wife
we have a new one in the house
and she stays home too also
huh-uh
i guess i have a wide variety
i like watching the t v for things that are interesting
not so much the things that arent
for example the $unc$cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and different strokes
huh-uh
but i like $unc$sixty minutes prime time live
huh-uh
of course i have to watch cartoons on $unc$saturday morning but not the ninja turtles
i like the old-timey ones $unc$tom and $unc$jerry
you sound like my husband
there you go
he likes $unc$tom and $unc$jerry and $unc$bugs bunny and $unc$all his friends and all those guys
right
$unc$johnnie $unc$quest the good ones
yeah yeah
if im ever home during the day on a vacation day i have to catch at $unc$twelve oclock the $unc$andy $unc$griffith show because hes $unc$one of my idles
but i dont know
it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic magnified and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings
huh-uh
huh-uh
and so i do with the $unc$cosby show
i have seen it a couple of times
and i do
i like the show
i just dont watch it because of the timing
yeah
but some of the crap thats on t v nowadays its about
yeah
i do watch the special shows that they come out with the $unc$nova stuff and the nature shows
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i think theres enough out there to pick from
im not
we dont have cable to the point of the $unc$h $unc$b $unc$o or any of that stuff
yeah
yeah
but
i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because with $unc$two kids
huh-uh
and i dont want them watching something that i dont think they should watch
or i used to be really hooked on all my children
sure
me
and i watched that for $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen straight years
no
and then id eat
at work wed have a t v or whatever
and then as my kids got older and started recognizing what was going on i thought this isnt really very good
so i gave it up
$unc$fifteen years
yeah
bet they hated that
i had watched it since it started
so
goodness
now i dont know who the characters are
and ill turn it on every once in awhile
and i dont recognize anybody
so i guess thats a good sign
yeah
really
i used to watch
i can recall
this might date me here
i can remember staying home when i was $unc$five and $unc$six and my mother watching the edge of night
huh-uh
yeah
youre probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm and the edge of night
secret storm
i think they were back to back and black and white
huh-uh
huh-uh
i was just a youngster
and i was like my gosh
yeah
we used to
my mother watched all that stuff too
and i think as the world turns may still on or not
still be on
it was not too long ago
yeah
now they got a lot of other crap involved
and so
yeah
youre right
i think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable
yeah
and that could be
i have to agree with you
yeah
keep them on the channel $unc$twenty $unc$one the nature stuff
right
yeah
we do
and its real interesting too the difference in my kids
my oldest loved $unc$sesame $unc$street and those kind of shows
huh-uh
my younger one doesnt
shes more into $unc$walt $unc$disney kind
we watch a lot of movies that weve got on tapes and stuff
huh-uh
shes more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
but we do a lot of kid watching
huh-uh
sounds like you got your hands full there
and i do appreciate speaking with you
sure
it was fun
have you gotten your catalog yet
no
i dont think so
yeah
i just spoke with $unc$jim
i just got my in the mail
and it inspired me to make more phone calls
i dont really
ive had a few people call me
but ive never made $unc$one
really
yeah
i need to get brave
yeah
give them your pen number
yeah
yeah
thats what i need to do
have a good day
thanks
bye-bye
bye-bye
all right
all right
what are some of your favorite foods
mine
i imagine in $unc$argentina youve got some great foods
yeah
we got a lot of european dishes
uh-huh
we got what some people call the best beef in the world
yes
so its $unc$bishu
every $unc$sunday you go out
and you buy all these parts of the cow
and then you just cook them over a grill
thats
in our house its already built in
theres this whole special place in the back
so you can make a barbecue
ive had that meal in $unc$new $unc$york where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued
yeah
yeah
and its marvelous
and then
i have to find a place around here that has that
they have an argentinean place down in $unc$georgetown
so
okay
ill keep that in mind
you serve that yourself or for a family
excuse me
you ever serve that yourself when you have company
no
the problem is im only $unc$twenty-two
uh-huh
but when im down at home
yeah
and somebody says okay when are we having this
and ill cook it
oh
you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on
and then you put all these different meats which take different times
do you buy them separately at an american grocery store now
or do you have to
you dont go buy it from a wholesaler
no
but what happens is in $unc$argentina they have all these little places like the fruit stand and the dairy products and whatever
little butcher shops yeah
and so
yeah
ive lived in $unc$mexico
so i know
and so they got the meat place
yeah
and so you just go there
and you cant find chicken there
you got to go to another place to find the chicken
yeah
you have poultry place
what dishes do you serve with it
basically its what we call it $unc$impenadas which is like
yeah
the turnover
the stuffed turnover
right
meat turnovers
i love those
uh-huh
and then we also put sausages on a bun
and then thats to start out with
yeah
and then what you have is also $unc$three different kinds of salad
uh-huh
and thats about it
do you remember when you were in $unc$washington $unc$sam the argentine baker
no
it used to be in $unc$georgetown years ago
he moved
i guess he retired and went back to $unc$argentina
i guess in the early seventies
okay
yeah
so thats before your time
yeah
your parents might remember if they were here then
no
we were only there for $unc$two years
okay
he was wonderful
we used to get the most marvelous $unc$impenadas and other argentine things
yeah
and what i also eat now since i graduate
i have an italian roommate
and
yeah
im italian
are you
uh-huh
and being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta
yeah
and
because therere many $unc$italians in $unc$argentina
yeah
and my mom makes what we call $unc$niokes and all this stuff like lasagna and everything
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
my grandfather came to the $unc$united $unc$states through $unc$argentina
okay
this was around the turn of the century actually a little bit later like $unc$nineteen $unc$thirteen
yeah
yeah
at $unc$one point $unc$one third of the population of $unc$argentina was italian pure $unc$italians
ill tell you
its interesting because when we cook here
im of italian descent
my husband is chinese
okay
and we both love continental cooking french cooking
okay
so we cook
our meals are
we dont usually mix
i mean that sometimes
right yeah
if were entertaining well do a chinese recipe
and there are really easy recipe
with chinese you always have several dishes
and nowadays with microwaves
you can steam many of the things in a microwave
yeah
i dont know if you have $unc$one
yeah
and if you like chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done
okay
okay
okay
and its a wonderful flavorful piece of fish
is it
yeah
because i was at
its like when you go buy fish
uh-huh
i buy the fish
so you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish
uh-huh
and yeah
ive seen the filet
yeah
buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish counter
what kind of fish
any white fish
sole is good flounder
okay
sole or flounder is real good and even grouper
so we put soy sauce and sesame
little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil
okay
and not too much soy sauce
some chopped up slivers of scallions and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just say $unc$two minutes check it after $unc$two minutes to see if the fish flakes
okay
and if the fish flakes its done
dont overcook it though
okay
because i got $unc$one of those little microwaves
the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water
you see just check it during
yeah
and another quick dish if you like do you know what $unc$hoi $unc$sin sauce is
its that sweet chinese sauce
no
i dont
if you go in a chinese store ask for $unc$hoi $unc$sin $unc$h $unc$o $unc$i $unc$s $unc$i $unc$n
wait wait wait $unc$h
$unc$h $unc$o $unc$i
$unc$h $unc$o $unc$i
$unc$s $unc$i $unc$n or $unc$s $unc$e $unc$n
$unc$s $unc$i $unc$n
either way theyll spell it $unc$hoi $unc$sin sauce
its a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown
and if you take little pieces of pork like little cubes of pork and you fry them with garlic and a couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some $unc$hoi $unc$sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in
okay
okay
okay
and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice
how much pork do you buy for $unc$two people
for $unc$two people if its american style i buy a half a pound if youre just serving that
but if youre serving another dish with it say the rice dish with guys pretty healthy appetites id probably go a third of a pound
right
and then you could
yeah
i could probably go half a pound
and you can always heat it up again and save
so its just since im from $unc$argentina i just love meat
yeah
and we
you can also do the same thing if you have ground beef
okay
just stir fry the ground beef
drain off the oil
use the same $unc$hoi $unc$sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables
okay
just stir that in
and youve got another dish
and how much does it cost
the $unc$hoi $unc$sin sauce
yeah
a dollar $unc$twenty-nine a can
okay
a can would serve you for quite a few meals
yeah
okay
i thought it was maybe $unc$five $unc$fifty or something
no
no
no
no
no
its not expensive at all
its $unc$one of the chinese cooking basics
okay
yeah
listen it was good talking with you
same here
hope you enjoy your recipe
all right
thank you
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
its hard topic because
is it doing a good job or a bad job
and you got to divide it $unc$two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
yeah
and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school
kindergarten all the way up to high school
okay
but youre excluding high-level education
yes
yeah
i am
okay
actually i think that higher level education
i dont think theres so much of a problem there
its pretty much funded well
there are small colleges that im sure are struggling
but its the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours
our school
even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city or $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c i would seriously consider moving if i had a child
i wouldnt let them go to a public school system there
but of course people are trapped economically
and they cant do that
yeah
i know down here the schools are
i dont know
they rate
i moved to $unc$arkansas and $unc$texas after living in $unc$ohio
and the schools down here rate bottom $unc$ten percent across the country
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why
because theyre so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers dont know whats going on
thats really too bad because its giving some people unfair advantage
our high school up here is like a junior college in $unc$florida
right
what we learned
that was my experience going through junior high up there
when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what id already done because we were so far advanced
yeah
and id been in a parochial school before junior high
and even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
yeah
so i like the concept theyve got now where they have more directed education
you pick a career path
or you get counseling earlier
and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending $unc$four years learning the same things over and over
they have that down there that
they talk about it
and there are a few like in
i live in a big $unc$metroplex
and some of the better parts of the $unc$metroplex the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but
yeah
its like if your father owns a grocery store and youre really interested in that
theres no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
right
or if youre going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art
theres no point in
im an engineering student
and if i have to go take art classes im not going to use them
and through high school i could have gone so much further if id gone to a school that was directed
yeah
thats true
i was fortunate
im a technician
and we had a vocational electronics in our high school
right
in high school
so when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school had a good program
right
i think the schools today theyre just overrun
they dont know what to do
theres too many kids and not enough teachers
and too many of the kids dont care
yeah
i find that in the cities its more like the kids go there socialize not really to learn
and
right
and the parents send them there because theyre supposed to
plus it gets them out of their hair
and i also find that you can send a kid to school
but if dont work with them as a parent i think youre putting your child at a big disadvantage
yeah
and theres some kids that want to go learn
but most of them just want to go play
yeah
i could see if a kid doesnt have any encouragement if theyre come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work
or maybe theyre unemployed
and theyre mad at the world
i can see where that wouldnt be very good for a kid
hes coming up will you help me with my homework
and theyre no get away from me
ive had a terrible day
so its got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
yeah
thats true
im wondering with the boom down here
its not at the moment
but a lot of the industrys moving southward
yeah
are they going to move to $unc$mexico
i dont know about that
but a lot of the industry up in the northern states is moving south
uh-huh
and im wondering if thats going to have any effect on what you see now
were behind down here
on the
i say we because i live here
if
that might not turn around in the next $unc$twenty years
yeah
maybe theyll bring their good schools with them
if the industry comes hopefully theyll promote good schools
yeah
because i know the town that i come from the large $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for $unc$one
plus for the type of student thats going to that school its going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists
right
youre most likely to do better in school
theyre going to help you
you hope
yeah
you hope
i think
i dont know
i just think its a duty of the parent to do that
jeez my parents always helped me
and i dont know
its just like you say
its the way youre raised and the economic situation youre in
i can see some lady
shes $unc$twenty-one years old
and shes got $unc$four kids
a kid in
her first grader
i dont see where shes going to have much time for them
so i dont know
its just like
i guess you just have to wonder
is it up to the
is it
whos supposed to make the change the state the federal government
wheres the money supposed to come from
is it
i dont know
actually i think it should be the city level and a system level really to find out and to see what they need and not overinflate it
what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
if the teachers are getting $unc$six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and youre getting raises every $unc$eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute
yeah
were in a recession here
our town didnt pass the school budget this year for the first time in many years just because people are in the recession
and theyre
even though weve enjoyed very good employment here for the past $unc$ten years
now we got $unc$eight percent unemployment when it used to be $unc$four or $unc$five
people are going whoa
yeah
starts hitting closer to home
yeah
but i always see its all money
this
like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime
its all money based
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level
and then if youre in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
who knows
bu-
maybe we need some more $unc$catholic schools
support the church instead
they seem to have done a good job in the past
in some places you couldnt go to a public school
it was miles down the road
and the only school you could go to was the $unc$baptist school or the $unc$catholic school
so
yeah
theyre a lot more strict
yeah
i dont
you have to learn
you arent given the chance to screw off all the time
yeah
i dont know if i would do that to my child though
so pretty much though
i dont have any good ideas or anything that would contribute
this isnt a subject that i think a lot about because im never faced with it because our school system in $unc$vermont it seems to do a really good job
i know im in the
the only reason i asked about secondary schools or advanced education is because down here going to the $unc$university of $unc$texas the education im getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
is it
i dont think im getting what i should
but in $unc$texas its next to free because they pay so much of it
its state supported
that
but at the same time its not like going to $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t
my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t
and its really too bad
but thats
i dont know
i think it just builds on the foundation that theyve already built
you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that dont have the background for an $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t kind of curriculum
so
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school
we have a very good public school up here
and a degree out there means a lot
its a very good school
its $unc$university of $unc$vermont
we also have some $unc$two year college
theres a $unc$four year colleges
they all have a pretty good reputation
but like you say you
there we go
yeah
i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
i think thats true
the $unc$bermuda grass is greening up in $unc$march
and sometimes doesnt really start doing that until the first part of $unc$april
so i think were a little ahead of schedule on that
yeah
yeah
i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon
and i noticed all that grass coming up
and i thought ooh
weve got to start this mowing bit soon
thats true
its been a fun break
but the break is over
yeah
i guess another thing ive noticed too here lately is that even though weve had some pretty warm days its been awfully gray just
yeah
the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
yeah
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window its gray
yeah
but id rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend
i go for that
yeah
yeah
in fact im a little worried about this one coming up here
we have a long weekend
and it sounds like its going to be a little bit on the cool side
yeah
i havent heard whether its going to rain or not
i think theres an $unc$eighty percent chance this evening
but its supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow
and then the rest will be without rain
thats good
but i think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
thats getting back to a little bit chillier
yeah
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year
i think
i havent seen the weather on the news in the evening lately
but i think the average high should be about $unc$seventy
yeah
im not certain either
but youre probably right
yeah
i like it when its sort of a medium temperature maybe $unc$seventy-five to $unc$eighty somewhere in there
i dont like it when its too cool or too warm
im much more apt to get things done when its at that sort of in between temperature
yeah
thats true
$unc$one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say $unc$ninety-nine degrees is within $unc$five or $unc$six degrees of the all time record high
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesnt vary very much
yeah
youre probably right
any other time of year thats not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
yes
as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on t v
and i think it was $unc$one day this week a year ago
uh-huh
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather
right
it wasnt just a super bad storm
but it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time
right
yeah
$unc$one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year was a $unc$twenty-six degree lightening storm
wow
i was going into the grocery store
and a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead
and it was $unc$twenty- $unc$six degrees out
and i thought gee ive never known it to lightening at that temperature
yeah
that is pretty unusual
and you really take notice of it too
thats right
it probably was a lot warmer up high
sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that $unc$twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing
the air temperature at $unc$five $unc$thousand feet was $unc$fifty degrees
the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldnt get away
wow
i dont like that super cold stuff
nope
i just dont move very well when its that cold
yep
im really enjoying this now
this has been interesting
yeah
not too challenging to the brain
not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you
nope
all right $unc$ellen
you have a good day
okay
bye
bye-bye
are you a player
i think i am
its been a while now
has it
yeah
ive
just recently i got married
and we bought a house
were about $unc$fifty yards from the golf course
oh
but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
yeah
so its been almost a year i guess since ive actually swung a club for a purpose
yeah
i havent played in about $unc$two years
and then i went out $unc$two weeks ago with the guys here
i work at $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
and i played in a tournament out there
and i shot a net $unc$fifty-nine
they were kind of little upset
i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits
yeah
yeah
i have a hard time inventing shots
lets go around this tree and try a slice through a hook here
right
and i cant do that
so
right
i finally got out
and ive been watching quite a few videos
i had not been able to play
so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while
and i hope im on the right track
yeah
shot a career low $unc$eighty-nine and my handicap is $unc$twenty $unc$nine
thats great
i like that
yeah
now like i say its been a while for me too
ive got my wife motivated about it
really
and i think thats probably going to be $unc$one of the next investments is get her a set of clubs
and well get out of the driving range and get some interest built up
and hopefully we can start in
yeah
ive tried to get my wife
i bought her a set of clubs $unc$four years ago
she hasnt even swung them
but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day
really
shes ready to get off into it
great
thats good
but i just like getting out being in the outdoors
and im a hunter and fisher anyway
but
yeah
same thing here
at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf
and its not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
right
right
and i walk
i dont ride
so
uh-huh
yeah
i get a little exercise there too
so
thats
ive got the same attitude
i tell you
i started
i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about $unc$eight or $unc$ten years ago now when i was in college
yeah
and i took it as a $unc$p $unc$e course and then kind of left it alone for a while
and then finally got into it while i was still in school
right
and since then weve made it
as the friends start getting married and things like that weve made a tradition of having a $unc$thursday
have probably a $unc$thursday night bachelor party and a $unc$friday golf day before the wedding
yeah
so it
thats back in $unc$south $unc$dakota where i grew up
oh
so thats been my main involvement
is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here
but eventually i get people to come and visit me in $unc$dallas
yeah
and then ill show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we cant do it back home
yeah
its pretty nice
we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not
they were amazed
yeah
here it is $unc$sixty-five degrees
were out playing golf
and theyre freezing cold back there
but actually i picked it up when i was in high school on the same as a $unc$p $unc$e course
yep
yep
when i got into the service i got into it
okay
and now when i come out here i just kind of let it go
and then $unc$one of the guys mentioned to me at work $unc$one day if i played golf
and i said yeah
ive got my clubs
but i havent swung them in quite a few years
uh-huh
and then i got into it and then back out of it
and it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there
yeah
thats right
i really enjoy it
its really nice
its a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody thats got the same level of interest
that seem to be the hardest thing
yeah
about
thats true of any sport
if you want to play tennis or racquetball
yeah
you dont want to go out and get beat to death
but
right
and people dont want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time
no
and
and then weve got some guys here that they are $unc$four and $unc$five handicappers
uh-huh
and they dont like to play with me because im too slow for them
but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for $unc$three or $unc$four hours and have a good time
right
thats right
yeah
and ive
never yet have i walked up
ive walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with
and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldnt allow me to join their twosome or threesome
thats true
they are always friendly
thats true
sure come on out
and they dont mind if you make a mistake
they dont mind saying let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
well
its pretty nice and friendly out there
thats so
and you cant find that in all sports
yeah
thats absolutely right
and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if
you get in a rut if you do play a lot
but you play with the same people you arent going to learn anything
yeah
after a short period once you learn everything theyve got to offer
then youve basically tapped your resources there
yeah
you need to
yeah
but eventually id like to work up if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a mixed doubles league or something like that
yeah
we have $unc$one down here in the summertime
it runs from $unc$five oclock to $unc$seven $unc$thirty or $unc$eight oclock because it doesnt get dark until $unc$nine $unc$thirty or $unc$ten
uh-huh
right
and we play in the summertime out here
we get a mixed league in
and thats what im trying to get her ready for
its going to start when we change time back whenever that is next month i guess
uh-huh
and it will start then
and we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago
and they were just starting to learn
and they were shooting a $unc$hundred $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty
sure
but they were
now theyre down into the hundreds nineties
right
so it wont take her long
thats good thats sounds like a lot of fun
and its something we can do together
so she doesnt do much hunting
she could care less about that
yeah
shes does a little fishing
but golf would give her the exercise
shed be outside
give her something to do that we both enjoy
so
yeah
it sounds like weve got real similar situations
yeah
ive gone home every year now since ive moved to $unc$dallas to go pheasant hunting
and the last time i took my wife along
uh-huh
and kind of the same situation
shes up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff
but shell make the trip for fishing if that comes along
yeah
yeah
but its interesting
all right
yeah
and its a game that you dont
like bowling you feel bad if you bowl a $unc$hundred
but if you shoot a $unc$hundred in golf
you dont have to be an expert to play
thats right
any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold $unc$one and learn how to do it and do it right
uh-huh
so you dont have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all
thats right
yeah
ive kind of formed the attitude that if i could pick $unc$two or $unc$three shots out of my game every time and put them together on $unc$one hole then i do pretty good
yeah
and i keep rationalizing that i can do it
i just got to do it all on the same hole
and then it will get better
and you just keep going
and in the meantime just enjoy what youre doing
yeah
it really works that way
and when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something
and i didnt get it done
uh-huh
and i need to slice this ball around here
i naturally slice anyway
the ball will go straight
and i go
yeah
but id get upset about it sometimes
yeah
and now i guess being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit
sure
i dont get upset any more
and
sure
and thats great
ive enjoyed talking to you
you bet
i guess ill go back to work
okay
sounds like it
all right
see you later
okay
bye-bye
bye
i havent had too much of a chance to watch t v lately
yeah
so probably everything i going to say is kind of dated
i can understand that
its that time of the year
yeah
my wife and i just recently moved into our house
so were spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but like to keep up to date too
oh
yeah
uh-huh
i guess in the
since i got out of college which was about $unc$five years ago my t v viewing started to tend more towards documentary news programs things like that
uh-huh
something thats going to keep mu up to date
ive kind of gotten away from being a series watcher having to keep up to date with
yeah
i think when youre in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
uh-huh
yeah
that makes a big difference
so yeah
i used to
when my kids were real little and i was home i watched
where i was home where i watched things on a more regular basis
but right now the last things i watched regularly was $unc$thirty something when it first came out
okay
did you all ever watch that
i started too and kind of worked away from that
yeah
yeah
i have a hard time sticking with something on t v because it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or $unc$two
yeah
you feel kind of left out
right
right
but right
i know
but i tell you what
were really strict with our kids about television
and $unc$one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted
and they wanted to watch
and we said okay well sit down
and well look at what you want to see
lets just turn it on and see whats on
we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
i believe that
so it was prime time
it was what $unc$eight oclock on a week night
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we have cable
and there wasnt anything on any channel
and the stuff that was on the networks $unc$a $unc$b $unc$c $unc$n $unc$b $unc$c $unc$c $unc$b $unc$s was
it was just dribble
yeah
it wasnt even funny
thats right
it wasnt creative
it was the worst ive seen
i have not watched prime time week night t v i guess in a real long time because i was shocked
yeah
i know exactly how you feel
you know what im saying
thats right
when i first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable i guess i kind of became numb
uh-huh
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v
and then all of a sudden i started paying attention to network t v again once in a while
right
right now we dont have cable
right
and its surprising how much its changed
uh-huh
the whole moral situation everything is just gone $unc$one whole complete direction different
and we dont have any kids yet
but i feel the same way
its really tough to find something thats going to be good and interesting for the kids even cartoons
right
oh
you watch some of the cartoons
and kids arent even going to understand half the humor thats in there
yeah
its
none of its probably damaging lot of times
right
its just like a necessary evil
when our children were younger when they were like $unc$four years old $unc$three years old $unc$five years old we just had $unc$sesame $unc$street
and that was about it
right
right
but now in order to seem humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff
yeah
yeah
but its just $unc$one of those things
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if youre in the room
but its such a shame because it could be so good
thats right
i dont understand why first of all the public puts up with it second of all why the networks think that we enjoy that kind of stuff
thats true
its hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that
that cant be the problem
uh-huh
it must be the marketing pressures
and their demographic studies that they do that show that everybodys $unc$i $unc$q has dropped dramatically or something
im glad you said it
and i didnt have to
but thats the
i feel the exact same way
i sit and watch some shows
and im embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show
i know
why do you do this to yourself
why do you do this
yeah
i know
im trying to think if theres anything i do
i like stuff thats on $unc$great $unc$performances
and we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that
okay
stuff i guess that mostly on public t v
right
as a matter of fact when i was a kid my parents used to have
we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched we had to watch an hour of public t v
theres an idea
that was just the rule
and if they saw us watching something
theyd say all right what did you see on whats new
or there was some other
the childrens program i think at the time was called whats new
okay
yeah
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program
yeah
yeah
thats pretty good
do you watch sports on t v
are you a sports fan
i cant handle it very long
yeah
im a sports fan
but its kind of like reading magazines any more
if half of the time wasnt spent watching commercials it probably wouldnt be so bad
right
yeah
but its
youre missing an awful lot
yeah
id personally rather see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium
but no
yeah
thats true
the traffic
i dont sit down
ill sit down for the big games the $unc$super $unc$bowl and the championship things like that
yeah
but i dont follow any team
uh-huh
i check the scores the next morning
and i know how everybodys doing
and that suffices me
but i like good humor once in a while
yeah
yeah
i enjoy that
but do you get that come-
you dont have cable now
i was going to say they have a comedy channel now
but again youre in a situation where youre watching mostly commercials
and then youre trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up
you know what i did
there was a time there where i could tape things
and then id fast forward through the commercials
uh-huh
saved a lot of time that way
yeah
it works
you bet
yeah
but that takes too much planning
yeah
no
i dont know
if theres any series that i pay attention to i try to watch $unc$cheers once in a while
now is that still real good
it used to be real good
but
yeah
it is
is it
in fact i think its on tonight
oh
i just got in from outside
so i
okay
so im kind of out of it
things like that
and i consider that fairly intelligent humor
yeah
yeah
you can tell
they pick up the words every once in a while
right
right
isnt it such a long running program
yeah
yeah
they do have good writers for that
that makes me think
do you watch $unc$saturday night live at all
i try to
yeah
we try to stay up too
yeah
its getting harder and harder
$unc$ten years ago wasnt so hard to stay up
yeah
it was just automatic too
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it
i think its come around again
its gone through cycles
yeah
it was
we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there
but we started watching again
uh-huh
but its real different show than it was when it started
yeah
its funny now
and its better
but its real different than what it used to be
thats right
thats right
but you cant be outrageous
right
if you keep that same format
theres only so long that you can be outrageous
so
yeah
that is for sure
i guess there are a few things around still
but
yeah
but you have to hunt hard for them
sounds like you pretty much agree
yeah
i guess so
been good talking to you
yeah
good talking to you
okay
take care
you too
bye
bye
okay
what kind of cars are you looking at
weve test driven the $unc$oldsmobile $unc$delta $unc$eighty-eight and a $unc$cutlass $unc$supreme and a used $unc$cadillac about $unc$three or $unc$four years old because i get married in a couple of weeks
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i have $unc$two kids
and my fiancee has $unc$two kids
uh-huh
so we need a car thats big enough for $unc$six
yeah
and so i guess it was $unc$two weekends ago we went car shopping and looked around
uh-huh
we found something interesting at $unc$crest $unc$oldsmobile $unc$cadillac up there on $unc$central $unc$expressway
uh-huh
that in addition to getting a new car there they can get you a car thats new
but its been a demonstrator model for $unc$two or $unc$three $unc$thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car
okay
uh-huh
so they call this program cars
and they come with a new car warranty
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
right
thats a real good deal
in fact my dad recently got a $unc$pontiac believe $unc$six $unc$thousand
uh-huh
and he got a demo
okay
and its been a real good car
yeah
and its like new
uh-huh
and it only had very low mileage on it
sure
and so i think he got a real good deal
of course theyre fully loaded usually
yeah
so i think its a pretty good option
yeah
i think so too
the $unc$oldsmobiles that youre looking at are they the demos
or they used
are they new
the ones that we were test driving were the new ones there
uh-huh
uh-huh
now they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in
uh-huh
and then the $unc$cadillac is definitely a used car
or
yeah
uh-huh
the guy said itd been on the lot about $unc$thirty minutes
he says itll probably be gone in a done
and its probably gone by now
no
those things go fast
uh-huh
of course we cant consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are $unc$twenty-five to $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars
yeah
but when theyre $unc$three years old theyre
the price already drops in half
uh-huh
so then it becomes more realistic
right
thats what im thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last $unc$two cars are brand new
uh-huh
or do i look for a used car thats maybe $unc$three years old but thats low mileage and in good shape
yeah
but i kind of worry about getting a car thats that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it
is it a lemon
or is something wrong with it
thats right
but i guess thats a risk you have to take
thats right
you can reduce that risk by having the car checked out
if youre going to look at $unc$fifty different cars you dont want to do this
uh-huh
but if youve narrowed it down to $unc$one or $unc$two you can have the car checked at an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they dont have any financial interest in it
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and then youll have a realistic assessment of what youre getting
uh-huh
about how much do they charge to do something like that
do you know
im thinking around $unc$twenty or $unc$twenty-five dollars
yeah
thats not bad
no
huh-uh
itd be well worth it if youre considering buying a car to find out
i would think so
i would think so
yeah
yeah
its kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago
and i
isnt that a good feeling
yes
i dont want to think about buying a car for a while
i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and hang on to the one ive got for a few years because its almost $unc$four years old
thats right
but its still in great shape
i have a $unc$mazda $unc$r $unc$x $unc$seven
what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for $unc$three or $unc$four years
uh-huh
and when youre ready to get another car just pay cash for it
yeah
i just about could really because i think my car
yeah
if i continue taking good care of it its going to hold a pretty good resale value
yeah
and if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldnt have too much trouble at all
yeah
i would think thats true
could you hold on for just a moment
sure
okay
im on a cordless phone
and i was picking up some background noise
so i just switched the channel up on it
i didnt want to interfere with whatever theyre trying to record
right
right
thats fine
anyway
but i really enjoy the car i have now
and i do want to hold onto it and enjoy it while its not having any mechanical problems whatsoever
thats right
in fact it never has
thats right
and its been kind of nice
and surprisingly enough after $unc$four years im not tired of the car at all
and i want to hang on to it while its still being a good car and while im not tired of it and while im single and can handle a $unc$two seater for now and get that out of my system
yeah
thats right
thats right
because $unc$one of these days ill be getting a $unc$six seater probably too
eventually
yeah
the first $unc$two cars i ever bought
ive bought $unc$three cars
and ive always bought them new
uh-huh
the first car i kept for $unc$thirteen and a half years and got a $unc$hundred and $unc$sixty-one $unc$thousand out of it
wow
uh-huh
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now
that just turned $unc$ten years old
and ive got a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty-two $unc$thousand miles on that
uh-huh
so thats kind of in the way ive done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
uh-huh
but my car is using $unc$two quarts of oil a week now
my gosh
about a quart every $unc$hundred miles
no
but it runs fine
all you hav-
its just very thirsty
yeah
if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay
but thats a sign that im going to have to do something sooner or later
right
what kind of car is it
its a $unc$buick $unc$century
uh-huh
are you going to trade it in on this new one
or
no
my fiance is selling a $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-eight $unc$cutlass $unc$supreme that she has
its actually in better condition than my car
okay
uh-huh
and so shes going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low
uh-huh
so shes going to sell it rather than trade it in
yeah
thats probably the best thing
you lose $unc$four to $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars a trade in
or maybe more than that as ive learned
really
yeah
when i bought my $unc$r $unc$x $unc$seven best offer i got for my other car was $unc$twenty-five $unc$hundred
i turned around and sold it myself for $unc$forty-two $unc$hundred
so
there you go
you can do much better
im glad youre taking care of it yourself
i think trading it in they just use that as additional
they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car youre buying
but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
thats fact
what i think
so
i think youre right
but strangely enough the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price trade in
interesting
but its a place in $unc$arlington
and i think maybe as you get outside the $unc$dallas area
i kind of
i bet you its kind of what i decided
maybe because its outside of $unc$dallas they are giving a little bit better prices
plus i was going through that $unc$t $unc$i fleet discount program
okay
did you use it at the car shop place
its before they had that
okay
i had gone over to $unc$texins
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program
thats right
yeah
and what you could expect they said a $unc$five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything
right
right
so i figured out a price based on that
yeah
thats good
but i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the $unc$town $unc$north $unc$mazda right off $unc$central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was going to be able to get it for in $unc$arlington
uh-huh
right
and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control
yeah
yeah
he said youre going to get a car thats got flood damage or hail damage
and they just laughed at me
and i went the next morning to $unc$arlington
and they gave it to me for that price
and whats so funny
they took the car i knew they were going to pull it from $unc$town $unc$north because thats where the white one was
is that right
and they had already told me we located $unc$one at $unc$town $unc$north
so it was that same car
my gosh
yeah
unless youre selling car with hail damage and flood damage i got the car off your lot for that price
and you laughed all the way to the bank
i did
and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the $unc$two $unc$thousand mile checkup
uh-huh
that they required you to do
and i took it to $unc$town $unc$north
and sure enough i saw that guy
and he recognized me
yeah
he said hi $unc$dana
and he kind of looked down and saw that car
and im sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day
yeah
of course when the place in $unc$arlington went and took the car because i told him theres a place in $unc$arlington thats going to give it to me for that price
thats right
he said no theyre not
yeah
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to $unc$arlington
so im sure he knew
such a deal
i loved it
i sat there
and i just had the biggest grin on my face
ill bet you did
it was kind of nice
$unc$dana its been really interesting
i appreciate talking with you
yeah
good talking to you too $unc$don
okay
have a good evening
okay
good luck in your car hunting
thank you much
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what kind of hobbies do you have
mostly what i do
i do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing
and then i read a lot
uh-huh
i like to read too
i was trying to think of some while it was talking about it
and then i
it took so long for someone to answer
i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it
oh
but yeah
id say reading is probably $unc$one of my biggest ones because its the type of thing that you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it or if i had the space
uh-huh
i live in a pretty small apartment
and i would have to put stuff away
i have $unc$two cats
so i couldnt really leave it out if i was working on something
uh-huh
reading is a little bit easier to work around
yeah
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go any space
thats right
i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing
thats true
i do the same thing
you get so involved in what youre reading
what types of crafts do you do
i do a little bit of woodworking
i used to
i dont have the equipment here
we moved to $unc$dallas about a year ago
uh-huh
and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment
uh-huh
and i did some of that
here ive mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand sewing and quilting and
what else have i done
things to hang on the wall
uh-huh
mostly just stuff that i can use right around the house or give away as gifts
uh-huh
right
ive been making a lot of quilts not a lot but several quilts lately
uh-huh
i enjoy sewing and needlework also
ive made some small things cross stitch things
and back when i was in high school i worked at a needlework shop
uh-huh
and i used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that
and i still remember how to do it
its just been so long since ive actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that
but i have recently done some cross stitch
uh-huh
and i enjoy doing that
its just the same old thing
its just getting the time to do it
yeah
ive done some cross stitch
but i never count right
and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or something
uh-huh
it never has worked out completely
yeah
it takes a lot of concentration
it was the type of thing
i was making some little things for $unc$christmas
and i also made a little thing for a baby gift
and i thought i can do this while i watch t v
wrong
right
no
you must pay all attention to what youre doing
it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be
it took me quite a bit of time
i though this wont take long at all
but i was wrong
uh-huh
it took a while to do
but it was fun
i enjoyed it
yeah
the first project i started out $unc$one was a big one
it was of a lady
and she was kneeling
and it was about $unc$fifteen by $unc$twenty maybe
my gosh
and i
it was just too much to start with
and i still havent finished it because i stopped
and i thought i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done
uh-huh
yeah
and there were so many different shadings and colors
and it was just too much to begin with
and i think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it
yeah
thats pretty understandable
and ive done some of the crewel and something similar to that
uh-huh
but it doesnt have the specific stitches
anyway its a little bit more loose and not quite as structured
and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that
uh-huh
more like embroidery or something
im trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby i dont even watch t v very much
i was tonight
but
yeah
i was reading when you called
yeah
how about movies
do you like to go to movies
yeah
i do like to go to movies
and i have a v c r
so i like to rent movies
and right now i have the movie channel
so ive recorded quite a few movies off of that
just ive kind of got a collection going of tapes now
and whenever i go visit my parents theyre always saying bring some of your tapes
they always borrow a few of them
i was over there
they live in $unc$duncanville
uh-huh
and i was over there at $unc$easter
and they said bring some tapes with you
so they are always borrowing my tapes
yeah
but
we
i like to do stuff with plants
i have a lot of plants in my apartment
and ive got a pretty small porch
but its
ive got a few planters out there that ill
in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there
and then in the summer ill plant petunias
or something thats colorful
and that blooms a lot
but havent done that yet
uh-huh
i kept thinking that it was going to get cold $unc$one more time
but i think were probably past that now
i probably should go buy some
yeah
i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening some
im not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that
yeah
its the hard work
yeah
i like the planting and watering is okay
its so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers
its so beau-
we dont
we live in an apartment also
uh-huh
ive got a few plants here
but im not really knowledgeable
i feel real good if i water them
and they continue to grow
i feel like ive accomplished something
uh-huh
so i enjoy it
but im just not experienced enough with
yeah
i dont know too much about it either
mines pretty limited to my little porch plants
and then the ones in my apartment half of which dont look real healthy
but i dont always get direct sun except in certain spots
yeah
and so thats probably my problem there
but
have you tried growing any fruits and vegetables or anything
i guess vegetables are in pots and stuff
no
i never have tried that just because i dont have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony
uh-huh
and my other $unc$two pots are
theyre pretty big
and i have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area
so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood theres no room for much else
but my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house
and i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff
uh-huh
but ive never really tried anything like that since then
i considered it last year
and this year both
but i havent done anything about it
uh-huh
so i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch
we get lots of sunlight here
and the porch is screened in
and its pretty large
wow
so i think if id do something be motivated enough to do something i think it would work out well
uh-huh
but there goes that motivation thing again
right
i enjoy playing with my cats
i dont know if youd call that a hobby
but i have $unc$two cats
and i gave them a bath tonight
so theyre a little bit angry at me
can you put them right in the water
they didnt like it too much
yeah
yeah
thats good
right in the tub
and it helps because its the time of the year that theyre shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine
so i thought thisll help them shed
and sure enough boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub
yeah
so theyre pretty content now
but they were mad at me for quite a while
they went and hid after they got dried off
sulked for a while
yeah
i like animals
but we dont have any yet
we have a $unc$nine month old with another on the way
uh-huh
and we thought maybe when theyre a little bit bigger then well
yeah
or get into a house with a little more space
id love to have some animals
uh-huh
but i like dogs
and my husband likes cats
so we havent reached a real agreement on that yet
if we get a place where we can have both itll be great
but until then
yeah
i like both
but since im in an apartment i dont think an apartment is big enough for a dog
to me dogs need a yard even little dogs
uh-huh
they just need a yard
cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine
but i just think dogs need to be outside though
so
i agree with you
i
if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat or even a bird or a fish tank or something small
yeah
now thats an idea
with the small babies
that she can watch but wont take too much care
yeah
because even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something
uh-huh
theyre not as likely to as a dog might i guess
but with little ones id be kind of scared to get anything that has teeth or claws
especially when theyre not quite to the age of understanding that theyre hurting
that
they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk
yeah
and if i was a cat or dog id respond probably by biting or something
i dont know
yeah
thatd be my self defense
but i think we probably reached our time limit
uh-huh
yeah
probably
and im out of good ideas for a hobby anyway
okay
it was good talking to you
thank you for calling
all right
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
do you have any pets
yeah
i have $unc$three cats and a dog
boy
sound like us
we have
go ahead
we just got the dog less than a year ago
so hes still a puppy
what kind is it
hes a mixed breed
hes part $unc$collie part $unc$shepherd and part $unc$chow more $unc$collie and $unc$shepherd than $unc$chow
so you
the only $unc$chow hes got is his tongue
hes got a blue tongue
yeah
oh
hes got little spots on them
we have $unc$two $unc$chows and a miniature $unc$schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig which wasnt by my choice
but i was out ruled
but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb-
but i just love them to death
was the guinea pig for your child
daughter
yes
yes
as if the dogs werent enough had to have a guinea pig
so anyway she enjoys her though
so thats what matters
but our $unc$chows weve had them id say right around $unc$six maybe $unc$seven years
and
really
theyre registered
and weve been breeding them
shes had about $unc$four or $unc$five litters
my husbands always wanted a $unc$chow
but im kind of concerned about having cats and how they socialize with cats which is $unc$one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed
oh
right
because we thought they would socialize easier
uh-huh
my husband had originally wanted an
and his brother has an
and so far hes bitten $unc$ten people
man
goodness
and the people that he got the from used to have cats
and they no longer have any other cats
its telling
we had a cat when we first married no took
yeah
we had the cat first
and then we got the $unc$chow
and bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her
uh-huh
and you would think that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and paw at their face
and theyd just play
and they never harmed her
so they got along great
i dont know how it would be bringing in cat to a full grown dog
yeah
i wouldnt want to bring a cat into a full grown dog
yeah
but i wouldnt feel hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats
right
i think they would socialize easier
i think so too
how old is your child
$unc$five
$unc$five
shes a real
so you had the dogs before you had the baby
right
and i was not really concerned about them harming her
i think a lot of that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
uh-huh
and ours are real friendly
theyre protective
but theyre very friendly and lovable
uh-huh
you think theyre lapdogs
theyll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything
and
what color are they
the females red
and the male is black
i bet the black ones pretty
yeah
hes a big old thing
and i was concerned about the female mainly
and as luck had it she had puppies the same week my daughter was born
so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about
about your baby
yeah
and that
yeah
i think that really helped my daughter since shes little has been playing with them
and they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever
and shes grown up with them and loves them to death
and they love her
so
yeah
i think its good for kids to grow up around pets as long as they dont have any allergies to them or anything
i do too
yeah
but i think it really helps them to understand when they go to other peoples houses
and they have pets
i see so many times kids just
they mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings
yeah
that or the other extreme
theyre terrified of them
and i hate that
yeah
yeah
and they shouldnt be
some maybe
but our miniature $unc$schnauzer shes just a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly
and a lot of kids are scared of that which i understand because she is a lot of movement and everything
but when she calms down theyre so scared of her
its
that bothers me because shes the friendliest thing
she wouldnt harm them at all
and thats mainly people that have never had pets around their children
so i think its a good idea to have them
in the past weve had birds too like $unc$cockatoos and parrots and the big white birds with the orange crest on top
uh-huh
ar-
the $unc$cockatoos are those the big ones
yeah
yeah
weve had those
and those are neat
theyre very messy yeah and loud
are they
a lot louder than a dog
a dog you can tell stop barking or whatever
yeah
but the birds its hard to keep them from squawking or whatever
but they were neat enjoyable animals to have
weve thought about getting an aquarium partly for the cats
uh-huh
i think the cats would really enjoy it
yeah
with a lid
yeah
yeah
of course
but so far we just
and starting up an aquarium
were thinking about getting a saltwater
yeah
they
and theyre so expensive to start up
yes
yes
they are
and in your the luck of keeping them alive through those first few days
yeah
yeah
the saltwater fish have so much more color
and theyre so much more beautiful
i know they are
the freshwater tanks just
really to me theres
most of them really arent that pretty
no
i really dont care much for them
right
i dont blame you there
i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than
i dont know
those fish are just beautiful
just so
you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
yeah
yeah
rather than just little fish
but i dont mind having
$unc$wren
my daughter had a little goldfish about a year or $unc$two ago
uh-huh
and it finally died
and that was neat
and theyre
she cant play with it
you can just look at it
yeah
yeah
you cant roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
and
yeah
i wouldnt dare have a goldfish here because it would probably be in a small bowl
and then my cats would knock it over
yeah
i have to be real careful about where i put things
uh-huh
if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
no
no
theyre always up where theyre not supposed to be
yes
yeah
and thats hard
thats just like kids
they know that theyre not supposed to do it
but theyre going to do it anyway because they know theyre not supposed to
thats right
and theyre so independent
i love having them for that reason
yeah
yeah
and until we got the dog it was real easy to go to town for $unc$three day weekend or whatever
sure
and now its like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while youre gone
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
that is hard
and i
we knew it
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog
we just saw him
hes so cute
oh
lets take him home
yes
and then the first weekend we had him we were in a $unc$two bedroom apartment
uh-huh
and my husband went out of town and left me with the brand new puppy
fun
and i had to work $unc$twelve hours that day
no
and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom
and i put paper all over the floor
when i came home i opened the door
and there were chunks of carpet padding everything all over the place
oh
no
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
no
i guess you didnt get your deposit back did you
i had the carpet fixed
good
i didnt even tell the apartment manager who got it
okay
no
bless your heart
but that was my first real experience with a puppy
when we had our family dog growing up i was $unc$eleven or $unc$twelve i think when we first got him
uh-huh
and i wasnt really involved in the paper training and teaching him commands and stuff
sure
yeah
so this was to me a whole new experience
yes
it is
only it wasnt like cats at all
no
no
i wish it was
i wish they were in that instinct
but they dont
our only problem with our $unc$schnauzer shes an indoor dog most of the time
uh-huh
and we found shes right at a year
and we finally got her house trained and everything
her only problem is trash
if you do not pick the trash up the container and put it on a table or chair or something shell knock it over
uh-huh
i dont care how full she is
so its not like shes hungry
its just she wants to get into trouble
my cats do that if i through anything away thats any kind of meat or anything like that
uh-huh
anything that they think is good
theyll get into the trash
yeah
and then it doesnt matter where you put it and where you hide it
yeah
and how tight you have the lid down on it
theyll get into it
ive come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor
i hate that
and the cats just looking at me like sorry
yeah
you shouldnt have left it there
i couldnt help myself
i just hate that when she does that
i just
and she knows its wrong
youll walk in the door
and shell cower and go hide under the table
uh-huh
so she knows she does wrong
but she continues to do it
so
yeah
the problem that were having with our puppy right now hes actually not really a puppy anymore
hes like $unc$sixteen months old
uh-huh
but hes still chewing
is he
the last thing he chewed up was when we
okay
all set
do you want to start
i can go ahead and start
sure go ahead
in $unc$dallas theres definitely a crime problem
i know its worse in the larger cities
its kind of a concern for me
in fact at the moment im thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment
and its
i am single and female
you definitely are going to worry about the location and accessibility of people to be able to break in
i live on a third floor now
but im real concerned that i dont want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that
and the
do they have many buildings that have security there
some buildings do
it depends on the location
the area i live in right now is real good as far as crime rate is concerned
and we dont have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards
yeah
yeah
i went to $unc$dallas when i worked for $unc$t $unc$i in $unc$abilene
and im a little familiar with the city area $unc$forest $unc$lane and through that off the freeway
uh-huh
and it didnt seem like it was that congested in that part
because to me where we live out here in the north east there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
uh-huh
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than $unc$one family in a house with the people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language
uh-huh
and theyre going to the big cities
it makes it very difficult
uh-huh
it really does
and ive seen the same thing that youre talking about much more crime than ever before drugs of course a big part of it i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i dont know
a lot of younger people into more violent crimes
yeah
yeah
thats really sad
you got young boys or girls at $unc$fourteen or $unc$twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever
uh-huh
theres a lot of that going on in $unc$dallas too
yeah
yeah
its really sad
it is
and i dont know if its the family thing where theyre not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and the kids arent getting the attention that they need or the television
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i really think that were falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
i agree
i think that people are getting off too easy
theyre getting paroled too easily
theyre just getting put on probation or something because the prisons dont have enough room
so they get lighter sentences
yeah
and some of those people they dont deserve to be let loose
and they had
in fact on the news last night we were watching this man who lost his $unc$ten year old daughter
he ran out to the store for a few minutes
and he had left her home alone
now $unc$ten years old
shes old enough to be alone for a few minutes
yeah
and while he was gone he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store
thats what it was
and someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these $unc$two men went in raped the girl murdered her and the whole bit
my gosh
and $unc$one of the men got i think it was $unc$seventeen years
and the other one was in for life imprisonment
uh-huh
the one that was in for the $unc$seventeen years actually served $unc$seven
and hes out
thats terrible
and the man said that if it werent for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to $unc$mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not think a thing about it
uh-huh
and i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands and that innocent people
yeah
i shouldnt say innocent because actually if they commit a crime that theyre in the same circumstances
but
uh-huh
the reasons that theyre doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it its like $unc$two different things
yeah
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things
yo-
i dont know
right
its a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
i like the idea that if someone is from a foreign country and they come to this country and commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
uh-huh
uh-huh
especially if theyre found guilty of the crime
uh-huh
once they have been arrested
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
uh-huh
thats it
we dont take care of them
we dont support them nothing
uh-huh
they go right back where they came from
right
we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is
so let their country take care of it
exactly
and
we dont have i guess too much trouble in $unc$dallas with
i guess we do have a lot of people come in from $unc$mexico that cause problems
but
but theyre so close
i dont consider mexican people in the same category with especially people who come from cultures that dont have the same kind of moral upbringing that we have
yeah
uh-huh
you take asian countries or the eastern countries where women are in the background and the men are in the foreground
uh-huh
and its like they live back in where we came from $unc$two $unc$hundred years ago
uh-huh
uh-huh
weve advanced beyond that
and i think that their mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing
you know what i mean
uh-huh
it was amazing
i went to the $unc$far $unc$east back in $unc$october to do some training for $unc$t $unc$i
and i
uh-huh
some of those countries were so safe it was unreal
$unc$singapore is supposed to be very safe
and in fact $unc$tokyo
and i thought $unc$tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
yeah
but they
at the $unc$t $unc$i there i said is there any area i should avoid
and the guy said let me ask another girl here
and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where $unc$dana shouldnt go by herself or anything
and she thought for a few minutes
and she said no
and he said is there any place you wouldnt go by yourself
she said no
and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
wow
and somebody will turn it in
and nothing will be missing
they said they can just about guarantee that that would happen if you did that
i thought boy in $unc$america if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again
wow
you better believe it
if
you wouldnt even have to leave it
yeah
thats true
it would get snatched right off your arm
thats true
but i was thinking boy in $unc$dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldnt go by yourself at night id have to set them down for about $unc$five or $unc$ten minutes to list all the places out
sure
i couldnt believe that she couldnt think of any place
they said apparently the crime is just
thats amazing
whats the difference there
do you know
im not sure what it is there
i know what it is in $unc$singapore is they have the death penalty
and they really enforce it
i believe in the death penalty
i really do
for drugs they enforce the death penalty for that
theyre just very very tough
and i guess maybe thats the way $unc$tokyo is too or $unc$japan is too
theyre just very tough on criminals
yeah
yeah
i think that were too easy
uh-huh
and we take the civil liberties stuff too far
uh-huh
people that are in prison we didnt put them there
they put themselves in that situation
uh-huh
yeah
and as far as them entertaining the rights that they should have
uh-huh
we educate them
we feed them
we take care of them
and they no sooner get out on the street and theyre back in again
uh-huh
im not saying theyre all bad
but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
uh-huh
right
i think that they should be put away
right
and if theyre overcrowded they shouldnt have gotten theirself there in the first place
get rid of them
exactly
i think that thats the whole key here
this plea bargaining baloney where they plead to a lesser crime or they plead guilty or tell about someone else and they get less time
uh-huh
uh-huh
or if theyre in there and theyve got $unc$seventeen years and theyre on good behavior for every year theyre in they get so many less that they dont serve the full penalty
uh-huh
i really think were going to far overboard with all of this
yeah
i agree because its not fair to those of us that deserve a safe life to have to
yeah
same with drunk drivers
right
i think its too easy for them
uh-huh
that if the laws were harsher and were enforced
uh-huh
you have to set an example
you have to start somewhere
uh-huh
and i think that people know that theyre going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that theyll be out on the street again
uh-huh
an i feel bad for the policeman because hes out there every day facing these people this craziness people with automatic weapons and all this other stuff and trying to do a job
uh-huh
right
and lets face it
what do they get paid
right
not much
$unc$twenty $unc$thousand dollars a year if theyre lucky
i wouldnt do it for that
yeah
huh-uh
and especially not in some of these big cities
in $unc$dallas theyve had
theyre up in the top $unc$five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty
and thats really sad
it really is
and theyre the first ones that take the brunt of everything
uh-huh
and im not saying that theyre all good either because theres good and bad in everything
uh-huh
but theyre already have $unc$three strikes against them when theyre out there
uh-huh
because theyll arrest someone and go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence
and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them what they say
okay
what go ahead and tell me about your home
my home at the moment is an apartment
is that right
yeah
i work here in $unc$germantown
but i live in $unc$pensacola $unc$florida
thats interesting
i own a home in $unc$pensacola
and lets see
we are to compare homes correct
okay
yeah
my home is typical for the area
i live in a development
its a relatively i would say
god it sounds like im bragging
no
thats okay
but its upper middle class kind of an environment
okay
its a $unc$two story colonial which my wife and i designed
thats neat
it has around $unc$thirty-two $unc$hundred square feet $unc$five bedrooms and so forth and so on
wow thats large
and i would imagine in terms of size and so forth its relatively typical for the area
it might be
i would say its probably midsized for the area
there are some smaller
and there are several larger
uh-huh
but based in terms of in that area of $unc$florida its what now
it is probably $unc$ten years old
thats not too bad
yeah
thats still fairly new
and so its
in terms of cost and size and so forth it
the housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country
lets say compared to $unc$maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a $unc$million dollars
but
youre kidding
do you mind if i ask what its worth down there
what its
i really havent
when we built it $unc$ten years ago it ran around a $unc$hundred and $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollars
okay
so i havent really priced in the market
so i
it sounds like
from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand
uh-huh
$unc$dallas is a very marked up area
although right now its a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything
uh-huh
the economy around here is real poor
i thought that was on the upswing again now
no
not really
uh-huh
the area itself the $unc$fort $unc$worth $unc$dallas area has become kind of depressed because theres been so many layoffs with big companies including $unc$texas $unc$instruments
yes
theres been tremendous amounts of layoffs
so really housing is real bad
the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad
but housing is still real bad
uh-huh
yeah
$unc$pensacola has
its really is a buyers market there now
yeah
this is
and it isnt because of the
there has been a lot of speculative building i dont know perhaps not in $unc$dallas
oh
but im sure people in $unc$galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it
$unc$pensacola is a $unc$navy town
uh-huh
and home porting was a possibility a few years ago
oh
they were expecting an influx of something on the order of $unc$fifty $unc$thousand people or more from the $unc$navy
wow
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels
thats no longer the case
so do you think
it was overdeveloped then
it is
the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population
wow
and so overbuilding has been a real problem there
so you can still get a good house for a very very reasonable price
and good i would
lets say typical say $unc$three bedroom $unc$two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land reasonable construction would probably run you right now somewhere between a $unc$hundred and a $unc$hundred and $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollars and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood
yeah
yeah
what about your home
right now were just renting
but it is a home
uh-huh
its a $unc$four bedroom home
it has about i guess $unc$eighteen $unc$hundred square feet
its on $unc$one floor
uh-huh
we have no basement
i dont know
nor do we
but
okay
i wasnt sure
most of the ones up north and everything do
but anyway its also pretty typical for the area
most of this area was developed
this house was built in $unc$seventy-four
uh-huh
so most of the
its almost $unc$twenty years old
and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style
we have a friend that lives $unc$two blocks over
and his house is almost identical to us except his is $unc$three bedrooms and ours is $unc$four
uh-huh
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same
so i think most of them are
there was
it
most areas that are built
there were probably $unc$two or $unc$three styles you could choose from
right
and thats pretty much all the houses in the area for probably a square mile id say at least maybe even a little bit more than that
the housing here in $unc$maryland is just atrocious and in the entire $unc$d $unc$c area
im only about $unc$twelve miles or so from the border of $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c and $unc$montgomery $unc$county
$unc$maryland is probably $unc$one of the most expensive places to
where are you in relation to $unc$sevren
are you close to $unc$sevren
no
we are west
okay
$unc$sevren is east near the eastern shore
i just
if i had
i have a sister that used to live in $unc$sevren
uh-huh
and they bought their home i want to say like around $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-five or something like that
and they paid like
they had it built from
they designed it and everything
and to have it built they only paid $unc$forty $unc$thousand for it
and when they left the area they sold it for a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty $unc$thousand
thats not unusual yeah
yeah
so i just wondered if the whole area was like that or
that area over there is not as expensive as in the immediate $unc$washington area
uh-huh
and so i was just looking
for example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a $unc$two bedroom condominium
and $unc$ninety-two $unc$thousand dollars for a $unc$two bedroom which is essentially a $unc$two bedroom apartment
it was very nicely done
yeah
i would have thought
sounds like a lot of money though
yes
i cant envision spending that much money on something along those lines
sure
yeah
so its
i guess you pay the piper
plus the taxes around here are phenomenally high
right
yeah
for the
and so you on that
its not unusual for example for somewhere around here on what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house
say for example in $unc$pensacola $unc$florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay $unc$three or $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars a year taxes maybe a little bit higher than that now
wow
yeah
but that same house here youd pay almost $unc$six $unc$thousand dollars a year taxes on it
wow
wow thats
so its so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive $unc$twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately the same price maybe a little lower
but the taxes would be perhaps maybe one-third of
really
that much of a difference
absolutely yeah
wow
so
its really sad
yeah
this is $unc$one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
wow
why is that
do you know
they do have such things as extremely good school systems for example
it has $unc$one of the best school systems in the country
uh-huh
because the cost of living around here is so high
oh
public employees make great salaries around here
oh
i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the $unc$montgomery $unc$county $unc$public $unc$schools makes
and im not
this is the figure
he makes $unc$eighty $unc$thousand dollars a year
my goodness
thats
wow
and i
by administrator i think i mean
they did not define it
but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone in that range
what do you think about it
most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i dont have any problem with
no
i dont either
its
it
i dont think its going to change very much
but
no
i agree with that as far as the mess thats developing as a result
as a country the $unc$united $unc$states
i think our hands are tied as far as any further involvement until the $unc$u $unc$n sanctions it
uh-huh
yeah
in fact it really was to begin with
yeah
and i heard a comment on the radio this morning that it gets to a point where if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the internal problems somebody may step in again
uh-huh
but i really think its a $unc$u $unc$n issue at that point because it is internal
yeah
the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the american public goes crazy
uh-huh
and now the fact that were not interfering with the internal rebellion in $unc$iraq theyre going crazy
thats right
thats right
you cant please them $unc$one way or the other
absolutely right
and i think that i agree with you
this is exactly the right course
thats an internal problem to $unc$iraq
it has nothing to do with us
uh-huh
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the $unc$u $unc$n gets involved then its nobodys business
thats right
these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time
all the time
yeah
some of them have been going on for tens of years if i understand it right in places like the $unc$sudan and
yeah
yeah
and its certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years
yeah
and its going to continue
thats right
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power its going to happen all the time
yeah
thats absolutely right
the $unc$kurds have tried it before
theyve gotten their butts kicked
yeah
and this is just another time that its happening
thats absolutely right
theyll regroup out in the mountains
and theyll try it again in a couple of years
yeah
it was
its a very opportune moment for them to try
you
sure
and i dont have any doubt that through some back channels we encouraged it
yeah
yeah
but im not real sure that we promised them anything
uh-huh
i
that would have been stupid
yeah
and i dont think we did it
everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right
i dont think they would have done that
yeah
i agree
but it really doesnt make any difference
this is just another chapter in middle eastern history
yeah
and there are many of them
theres no doubt about it
sure
the $unc$british occupied the place
the $unc$french occupied it
weve done it
its happened so many times
this is really nothing special
uh-huh
and so many of the conflicts really dont have a basis in politics or human rights or anything like that
its religious based
thats right
its mostly religious anyway
and by self-proclamation this is a holy war
and it is right
yeah
and then we go on from there
and
yeah
exactly
yeah
its a mess
its
theres no doubt about it
and
i think $unc$one of the big problems
looking at it from the american publics standpoints they dont understand the $unc$middle $unc$easterners
thats right
they dont understand what
their politics really isnt politics
its religion couched as politics
uh-huh
uh-huh
and theres a big difference
absolutely
we sit there
and we think that they think the way we think
uh-huh
and thats a big mistake because they dont
you bet
you bet
yeah
because theres a complete different set of values
uh-huh
theres different value placed on human life right down the list possessions and everything else
yeah
yeah
and whats right is wrong and whats wrong is right in some cases
thats it a lot of the time
i was stationed in $unc$turkey for a year and a half
okay
and it was tough understanding those folks
yeah
yeah
theyre so completely different culturally and socially and religiously
uh-huh
it was very strange
i believe it
it was very interesting
yeah
yeah
i can believe that
yeah
i dont claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means
but
i
shoot i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts dont have a clue sometimes
thats probably true
thats probably true
they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
uh-huh
im not real sure thats appropriate
no
no
thats
a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
no
but
i sort
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too
yeah
and we make experts by reading books
thats right
and the $unc$japanese and the $unc$germans and everybody else make experts by doing
uh-huh
absolutely
yeah
absolutely
yeah
i guess you work for $unc$t $unc$i
thats right yes
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
right
right
thats an everyday occurrence
yeah
its like our car industry
the only reason our car industry hasnt gone down the tubes is because the $unc$japanese came into it and helped us out
uh-huh
uh-huh
i agree
yeah
its an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures or even accepting them
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it bites us over and over
the
yeah
and until we start changing our educational system weve already been overtaken
but its going to get even worse later
uh-huh
looks whos getting the engineering degrees and the math and the science and everything
thats right
its not us
thats right
weve got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that
uh-huh
absolutely
and where are the engineers coming from
theyre coming from various places
and a lot of them are going back there
yeah
exactly
thats
my roommate is a
hes getting his doctorate in industrial
its not industrial engineering
its human factors
okay
his degree was in industrial engineering
i see
and hes from the $unc$philippines
yeah
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
right
he has no intention of going back to the $unc$philippines because theres no jobs
sure
okay
but i see it all too often
weve got loads of foreign students
uh-huh
and theyre coming here going after the hard degrees
and then theyre going back to $unc$korea and $unc$japan and $unc$hong $unc$kong and everywhere else
absolutely
and theyre applying it there
thats right
and i dont know
to me its amazing
i dont know what were going to do as a country
were going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
yeah
every
the countrys got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that
uh-huh
and the long-range views are just kind of become a thing of the past
yeah
you
and
i dont think there can be anymore long range planning
i think its sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
uh-huh
heres a crisis
lets plug it up
yeah
yeah
i dont know
i dont know what the answer is
its far beyond me
yeah
thats for sure
thats the way things have gotten
yeah
all we can do is keep plugging
yeah
i wonder
i read in the paper just last week $unc$i $unc$b ms unveiling their new laptop computer
uh-huh
at a price tag of $unc$six $unc$thousand bucks i dont know if theyre going to have a whole lot of takers
no
absolutely
be-
now i have the $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$p $unc$s $unc$two
okay
but im sorry i got it
yeah
its slow
there are many better machines on the market right now for a
yeah
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school
okay
okay
and i saved $unc$forty-eight percent
uh-huh
so i said if i can have an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m for $unc$forty-eight percent discount ill take it
absolutely
but up to that point i had always said i would never have $unc$one because i wouldnt pay that kind of money for their name
thats right
but
thats absolutely right
yeah
now you watch
just sure as anything the $unc$japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
the
unfortunately the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get something in your hands
uh-huh
its already outdated
its obsolete
and we fight that battle every day here at work
yeah
yeah
yeah
i can imagine
and
years ago i remember when i had a $unc$t $unc$i $unc$ninety-nine put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other
uh-huh
and things just kept changing so much
and i kept getting rid of them
and i finally said you cant do this
thats right
youve got to buy something and stick with it
so i just
thats right
at an opportune time i got $unc$one that suited my needs
and ive just stuck with it
the only thing ive done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive
okay
yeah
and thats all i plan to do
of course im limited on memory now because ive got the low line
i got the model $unc$twenty-five
okay
so im stuck with $unc$six $unc$forty
but im not a power user
so it doesnt matter
yeah
thats the key whatever works for you
yeah
and if it does the job then thats what you need
yeah
my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
hes looking now to get rid of his
hes got a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six and wants to get a $unc$four $unc$eighty-six this kind of stuff
uh-huh
on this subject of invasion of privacy yes its very easy for anybody to find out about you
your
i dont really like that very much
yeah
the special on channel $unc$thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this $unc$one person went about finding out from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are his $unc$social $unc$security number drivers license any kind of records he may have their credit card and the status of their credit
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff
it was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person
oh
and it was
mostly it dealt with marketing companies these direct marketing associations
yeah
uh-huh
that was the primary subject
thats how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets their habits their hobbies their income
and theyre able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
thats not really good
i dont know
i guess thats an invasion of privacy
im not sure that thats an everyday thing though at least not for an individual
uh-huh
something that i feel is pretty much an invasion of privacy is something thats really so common that its accepted as the norm now is the open office concept
the open office
uh-huh
where they have the little partition dividers throughout a large room
yeah
and people have little cubicles
thats all fine and good
but you dont really have any privacy at all
not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i suppose because you can easily be overheard
right
and they get
i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen
yeah
yeah
there is
and its not just that
its the whole thing about if youre trying to concentrate its rather hard
sometimes its almost impossible to do because your space is not your own space
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i work in a situation like that
and i really kind of have a problem with that
do you work with mixed company male and female
or
yeah
is there anybody who doesnt
there are a few out there
i suppose it depends on who youre working for and where at
yeah
but my own environment is open totally
there are no cubicles
theres nothing to block anything
so yeah
but i guess were changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybodys record
yeah
or the computers the big advent of that i believe because they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button
and it appears in front of them
uh-huh
and you dont have to
i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
uh-huh
thats no secret
and it shouldnt be that way i dont think
yeah
i dont think thats quite right either
its not really government for the people and by the people
ill tell you that
yeah
what do you think could be done about it
the only way it can change is if everybody bands together
its just like we need to get rid of these clowns thats serving in the office
the only thing really that can be changed is for everybody to say weve had enough of you out you go
but i dont see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that
uh-huh
it has to be $unc$one common ideal goal for that to be done
i dont know
its still a free i suppose country insofar as were able to obtain information
and i wouldnt be for total banning of all information
or its mostly the private information that were all concerned about
but its hard to define a lot of those boundaries
yeah
it really is
its
something that ive just had a dealing with is a credit bureau
uh-huh
they take my name which is a very common name
and my last name is even more common
uh-huh
and they check that name against their list
and they find several
and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name
so youve received a lot of flack
they dont even check my $unc$social $unc$security number
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately
and theyre not
theyre so lazy
theyre just not doing it
they just find your name
and they match it up
uh-huh
and that just drives me crazy because theyre
and then they want
then to get it removed they say you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them
and then it takes $unc$three weeks and all
and im like baloney
uh-huh
you messed it up
you fix it
is that usually what you tell them in the letter
no
what ive taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
uh-huh
recently i was reported as having $unc$j $unc$c $unc$penney accounts
and i dont
so i called $unc$j $unc$c $unc$penney
and i said i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency youre using is incorrectly reporting the information that youre providing to them
and they say uh-huh because they really dont want to pay for a service thats not being done properly either
uh-huh
so then they can call the credit bureau and say hey were paying you good money to report this properly
and youre not doing your job
good idea
so thats what ive taken to doing lately
and it seems to work pretty well so far
uh-huh
thats good
any other problems
not that i can think of
yeah
i guess ive just about run out of
yeah
i can probably go on
but its
im clouding up right now
yeah
i probably better let you get back to work
its nice talking to you
okay
maybe again
all rightie
bye-bye
bye-bye
i dont know what the last thing ive done as far as car repairs go is change oil and filter and that kind of stuff
i havent gotten really involved in anything extensive in car repairs in probably a year or so
i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an $unc$oldsmobile
yeah
i had a similar thing that ive worked on cars ever since i was a kid
and that was some time ago
but ive gotten to the point where the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that most of the cars
i try to buy as simple a car as possible
yeah
i know what you mean
so changing the oil changing the spark plugs
and most of them now you dont go through the ignition stuff anymore because thats all solid state or fuel injected
yeah
or fuel injected
and so theres
so there goes the carburetor
and if the fuel injection system breaks down theres no way in the world youre going to work on that
yeah
no
theres no way
somebody once said i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it
and a woman asked me what that meant
and i said that means that i cant work on it
yeah
yeah
basically thats it
theyve gotten so complicated or so high tech that average guys cant really go out in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs
yeah
ive got an $unc$eighty-four $unc$chevy van thats a $unc$one ton van with a camper conversion on it
yeah
its got the good old $unc$three $unc$fifty standard engine in it
absolutely
regular gas engine
and that engine i understand
i can actually work on that engine
yeah
i used to have $unc$chevy van
it was a short van that had the $unc$three $unc$fifty in it
yeah
uh-huh
and basically it was a motor
and you didnt have all the other junk around it
right
and you could get to it to work on it
yeah
i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago
and it was really fairly easy
take the grill out and the radiator out
and you can just stand there and work on it
yeah
the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
thats true
youre right
by the time youve finally got down to it
i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went
thats kind of the way i was
i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went
and i dont think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
a few years ago i had an $unc$oldsmobile diesel
and the
it
after about a $unc$hundred $unc$thousand miles the injector pump went out on it
and i bought it when we were living in $unc$lubbock
when i came back here i brought the car back here
and i dont know diesels got pretty unpopular
and you couldnt sell the thi-
though for what you could get for $unc$one you might as well drive it over a cliff
and the injector pump went bad
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it and reinstalled that
and that was probably $unc$one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
i dont think id know where to start with a diesel
i-
diesels dont require mechanics
they require plumbers
thats true
and
i think the closest thing ive come to a diesel is ive worked for a tractor repair shop when i was in high school
and we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
yeah
and they were nearly all diesel
but as far as cars ive never never been involved with them
the injector nozzle and stuff in the big diesel farm tractors are about the size of your thumb
and the-
yeah
and you can get to them
yeah
you can get to them
and the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
i
ive had a lot of good service out of that car
but i finally gave it to my son
and he drove it literally into the ground
yeah
he was out at $unc$tech
and he finished it off
i guess youre right
the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status
i dont know exactly why
$unc$one of the reasons is
im beginning to wonder where do you get gas at
i su-
i dont know if its still limited like it was
i dont notice it probably because i don-
what
the availability
you mean the diesel availability
yeah
i dont notice
but maybe because im not looking for it
yeah
id bought a $unc$g $unc$m $unc$c diesel pickup and loved that thing
i really liked it
but it turns out a pickup wasnt what i really needed
yeah
and it was the van that i needed then to buy the
traded it in on the $unc$chevy van
but sure enjoyed it
but you got the $unc$three $unc$fifty in the van
yeah
yeah
the $unc$three $unc$fifty regular gas engine
yeah
thats what i like because theyve got plenty of power
and if you treat them right theyre not the gas guzzlers i think that theyve got the reputation to be
uh-huh
im convinced that $unc$detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small $unc$v eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
yeah
co-
uh-huh
im convinced that the small $unc$v $unc$eight like the mustangs original $unc$two $unc$eighty-nine or some of the $unc$chevy $unc$two eighty-threes were good little $unc$v $unc$eight engines that were not gas guzzlers
uh-huh
but they had enough power t- pull all this weight
yeah
and the $unc$four cylinders just dont have it
i think the little $unc$chevy $unc$v $unc$eight when it started out in $unc$fifty-five i think was $unc$two $unc$sixty-five something like that
yeah
not whole lot more than the $unc$six cylinder that i think was like about $unc$two $unc$thirty-five or so
but they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a small block $unc$four $unc$hundred that was the same block just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more an
i think those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it
but
that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
yeah
the $unc$two little cars ive got now
bought a $unc$mitsubishi $unc$mirage here a couple of years ago
and it was normally carbureted
and its fairly easy to work with because theres not just a whole lot in it to go wrong changing the plugs and stuff
yeah
thats kind of like
my first car was a $unc$fifty-six $unc$mustang
and over the years all
i had a $unc$dodge pickup several years ago
and i cant remember the size of the engine
it was a $unc$three $unc$seven or something like that
yeah
but i remember working on those cars
youd open the hood
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things
uh-huh
uh-huh
now you open the hood and its scary
yeah
like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
the friend of ours over here hes got $unc$sixty-five or $unc$sixty-six $unc$mustang the $unc$six cylinder
yeah
and i was look under the hood of that the other day
and like you say you can see the road
yeah
its amazing
if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
my dads got a new
i guess its an $unc$eighty-nine or $unc$ninety $unc$chrysler something or other
its $unc$one of those transverse mounted $unc$v sixes front wheel drive
yeah
and he was showing it to me
and were looking under the hood and everythings nice and clean
and you can see the $unc$three spark plugs there in the front
and i said where are the other $unc$three
and hed never really thought about it
yeah
and he says hopefully i wont have to change them before i trade it off
yeah
its going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
yeah
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics cant do much with them
yeah
when they started with the newer engines
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much trouble because the $unc$three $unc$fifty with all the
actually i guess her-
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last ive paid any attention to it
the $unc$three oh $unc$five was that $unc$v $unc$eight that they put in the $unc$three quarter and half ton van
uh-huh
and it had all the air pump and i dont know all that stuff
right
yeah
the anti-smog pumps
and all the anti-smog stuff
and boy that was really a mess back under there in that van
and all that stuff loads the motor down
uh-huh
uh-huh
so its trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things
but thats $unc$one good thing
ive got a $unc$eight $unc$ninety $unc$chevy $unc$blazer now
and its got $unc$one belt on it a serpentine belt
its that one thats about what an inch and a half wide
yeah
got a bunch of groves in it
i havent had to replace the thing yet
it looks like it would be better than having
ive got an $unc$olds $unc$toronado that i thinks got $unc$six belts on the sucker
yeah
and i had to get all those off when i was replace that water pump
yeah
and i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
yeah
its kind of like the inside dual on a truck
when $unc$one of them breaks its not the outside one
man
its usually that power steering be-
or something thats way back in there
you bet
everything elses got to come off first
everythings got to come off
its a pleasure meeting you
yeah
and well
how many times have you done this now
is this
ive got $unc$five stickers here from $unc$t $unc$i
so i guess ive done probably id say $unc$seven or $unc$eight of them
yeah
i hadnt gotten any calls here in the last
this is the first one in a week or so
yeah
i havent gotten any calls in $unc$two weeks
so i dont know if its tapering off or what
if its winding down or what
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers
finding a taker
so it sounds
its taken them $unc$fifteen minutes at a time
so people are either not
no-
maybe theyre burnt out or
yeah
yeah
let you go
thanks for talking
okay
all right
bye-bye
okay
do you do a lot of cooking in your family
i do some every now and then
i work
and my wifes home during the day
so she usually ends up doing most of it
yeah
when i was single we used to always cook around the house
yeah
do you like to cook
yeah
i really like it
yeah
yeah
theres a few dishes
i grew up with having polish and ukrainian food
really
and my wife she likes italian and stuff
oh
so we definitely have different tastes
so
yeah
yeah
but thats neat though because you get to have different stuff
uh-huh
yeah
im a pretty bad cook
im pretty bad
my husband is really good
he put himself through college working in restaurants
wow
and hes much better cook than i am
so when i was home i still cooked a lot
and i was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff
now i went back to work about a year and a half ago
so $unc$one of the things that he took over was the cooking
and the kids are thrilled
theyre really happy that i dont cook anymore
theyre like preferring it now right
yeah
they say oh dad let dad cook mom
let him do it
but so do you have kids
you obviously have $unc$one
yeah
$unc$two
$unc$uh-huh
okay
you have $unc$two
yeah
$unc$one is $unc$nine months
and the other is $unc$two and a half
$unc$two and half
yeah
thats the hard part is cooking with kids around becau-
i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesnt it
or are you not at that stage yet
yeah
it does
yeah
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we eat
right
and my sister shes the master of the fast order grill
yeah
she makes $unc$six different meals
but
my gosh
like to have $unc$one thing
$unc$one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs
my gosh
i couldnt
and then she makes noodles with soy sauce or whatever
yeah
so all things
boy i couldnt do that
i
but yeah
our favorite
let me think
i was thinking of the $unc$one recipe that we made
i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy
and that was scallop
whats that
really
it has a french name
it basically means that it has a swiss cheese cream sauce with it
and you pour it over rice
yeah
what is that $unc$saint $unc$jack or something
yeah
$unc$scallops $unc$saint something
or yeah
yeah
i cant even remember what the recipes name is anymore
yeah
yeah
but it was basically just ground up swiss cheese and then standard cream sauce base and then the scallops
really
with scallops
and it sounds sort of funny
but it tastes really good
no
no
im from $unc$new $unc$england
so we had a lot of seafood before we moved down here
and that sounds delicious to me
yeah
that sounds great
yeah
but
were just thinking of having a dinner party
we went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game
they had a murder mystery
uh-huh
and you came dressed as $unc$one of the characters
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
uh-huh
and it was really fun
and so we were going to try doing it ourselves
but were trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table
and that kind of interrupted the game
so i was thinking theres this $unc$beef $unc$bourguignonne recipe that ive tried before thats pretty good
right
yeah
and then you can make that ahead
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until youre ready
uh-huh
so thats
yeah
thats another thing
i have a problem with my wife
yeah
she doesnt like the beef dishes
she likes the chicken and fish
yeah
and like i said we always ate beef and pork a lot
yeah
so
i know
my husband did too
his parents are austrian
and they always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
yeah
red meat plenty of good red meat
yeah
yeah
yeah
my dad could eat a meal with out any vegetables at all
my gosh
and susans they had meatless meals
yeah
yeah
my dad wouldnt know what to do
gosh
so do you
course she grew up $unc$catholic
so they sort of come with the
they did the
theres a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have
that you do
right
right
thats just part of it
uh-huh
yeah
my family didnt
but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly
he never
uh-huh
there was dishes that he really enjoyed eating
uh-huh
there were several things that he liked
but it never was really something that he would have chosen
its just that i cooked
so he had to put up with it
right
but there was $unc$one thing that he couldnt stand
and that was soybeans
i tried it like once or twice
and he just could not eat it
so i never
i had
i was limited
i had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans
but
yeah
its hard to get a protein content up then
yeah
yeah
thats true
yeah
i like them every now and then for a change
its nice
yeah
some of the stuff is good
but it was a tremendous amount of cooking
because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure theyre complete
uh-huh
and we had little kids at the time
when i was home with them and it was just so much cooking
i dont like to cook
and im not really that great at it
so it just turned out to be too much cooking
so i guess ill let you get back to feeding your little one there
no
hes all done
hes set
okay
yeah
yeah
i set him down
okay
do you like to bake at all
or do you get into that
yeah
we used to do that
my mom used to go crazy every $unc$sunday until my dad like blew up
yeah
after he gained about $unc$eighty pounds after coming back from the $unc$navy she stopped doing it
but she used to have $unc$two dozen sticky buns $unc$three bread rolls every week
really
no kidding
and the sticky buns of course would last $unc$three or $unc$four days
and that would be it
yeah
then be gone
i know
thats the thing about baking
i dont mind baking at all
and i can do a pretty good pie
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother
and my mother taught me how to make it
uh-huh
i can make a pretty mean pie
but i dont do it anymore because its just too fattening
we had the same kind of problem
if you make homemade bread
uh-huh
its supposed to save you money
but you eat like $unc$three times the amount of bread that you usually eat
it tastes so good
uh-huh
we had that bread that was
you ever seen the starter bread
i cant remember what its called
they call it the amish bread here
but
yeah
its made with
you just leave it out
yeah
and you let it spoil sort of
yeah
uh-huh
ive heard of it
but ive never done it
yeah
that sounds pretty good
yeah
it tasted pretty good really
yeah
yeah
but its the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
and then you add all these other ingredients to it
but
yeah
and then you make the bread
but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something
yeah
right
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
and thats how they continue the thing
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know it always sounded
i dont know how safe that was
yeah
i know it sounded strange to me too
i figure youre baking it
so yeah
yeah
thats true
thats got to kill anything i guess
but
okay
ill talk to you later
all right
yeah
thanks
where are you calling from by the way $unc$texas
$unc$plano
where
yeah
$unc$plano in $unc$texas
$unc$plano
okay
are you in $unc$texas
no
$unc$falls $unc$church $unc$virginia
no kidding
gosh it sounds so close
yeah
i know weve got a good connection
must be a $unc$t $unc$i connection
yeah
yeah
i thought for sure you were in $unc$dallas or something
yeah
i talked to so many people from $unc$texas
thats where practically everybody i talked to is from
yeah
yeah
i think thats why they call me because they want to get people outside the state
yes
theyre trying to get all different amount of people
gee my husband is from $unc$richmond
and i went to $unc$u $unc$v $unc$a
thats where we went
really
yeah
yeah
yeah
i went to school at $unc$west $unc$virginia $unc$university
you did
yeah
but i grew up right here in $unc$falls $unc$church right outside $unc$d $unc$c
yeah
boy wed like to get back over to the $unc$east $unc$coast
ill tell you
its nice over there
yeah
its sort of funny
i have people that want to go to $unc$dallas
really
yeah
$unc$one of my friends here he was just talking how hes thinking of leaving the company and going to $unc$dallas
saying how
yeah
no kidding
things are doing pretty good down here
we tried to move over to $unc$raleigh last year
and there was such little going on in $unc$raleigh
you couldnt get a job to save yourself over there
so we decided well try in a couple of years
but business is
yeah
yeah
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash
yeah
you probably could
$unc$northern $unc$virginia
okay
okay
its good talking to you
nice talking to you too
take care
bye bye
bye
i dont know what you think about the subject
i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that
ive been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody
and i dont know that thats not a good idea
thats not a bad idea
i
that
they probably need to change it somehow
the whole system needs changing
weve just got too many people in there and are putting too many people in jail that probably dont need to be there
i agree
and its another form of sentencing
uh-huh
but on that $unc$one thing i still think it should be a unanimous decision
yeah
i agree
yeah
i think were getting to the point now where theyre going to eventually let it be majority vote
and thats not going to be good
i dont like that
no
no
i dont like that at all
i know my husband served on a jury a few months ago up here in $unc$denton
but it was a drug conviction
and i dont remember
he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it
and i dont remember exactly how much he had
but not selling it
theres a difference
couriering it is what
ther- is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier
and he was a courier
right
and he sat on that jury
and they found him guilty
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything
and they were told during the trial that this is this guys first offense
and hes got this clean record
and they ended up
the jury decided its time to crackdown here
and it was time to do this drug thing
and lets crackdown
and lets really
and they sentenced him to $unc$fifteen years which they thought that that was a good thing
uh-huh
and they sentencing him to $unc$fifteen years
and after it was all over they let me come over in just a second okay sit down with the judge and with the other $unc$two lawyers
and they were told that he would probably serve $unc$three of the $unc$fifteen and that he had $unc$three previous convictions
uh-huh
uh-huh
however they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all $unc$three of them were in appeal
yeah
so the jury didnt know about it
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guys first offense
sure
so well give him $unc$fifteen which will teach him a lesson
but its just horrible since it was first offense
yeah
and hed been convicted $unc$three times before
oh
and the jury was very upset
and my husband came home very upset
he felt that they had been tricked
right
so something
i wonder if a judge didnt have control of that if some of that would change
yeah
the judge might know
or at least it wouldnt hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better
if it didnt we can come back for something else
or
thats true
thats very true
or what weve got
so
yeah
we definitely need a change in the system
and
yeah
obviously what we are doing is not working
its not working too
no
its just piling up on us
yeah
and theres people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form
right
and either theyre in there forever or when they get out its a matter of a few months
right
and theyre going to be right back for the same thing
so the system
were just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes
so
thats very true
yeah
yeah
i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day
and i said i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the $unc$united $unc$states to
and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
uh-huh
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves
right
we
and the-
i know people say it would be cruel to pull our aid from these other countries
and maybe so
so tell them youve got $unc$five years to work out a plan to make it on your own
right
yeah
and we will continue funding you for the next $unc$two years
after $unc$two years well cut it down $unc$seventy-five percent
uh-huh
and after another year well cut it $unc$fifty percent
and in $unc$five years it sh-
by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help
sure
and then we will have the money if we would do that to work on your own system because weve got some serious problems here
yeah
and were trying to heal the world
very serious yeah
its just not working
yeah
your right
i look at the aid presented to the $unc$kurds
and i feel sorry for them
and i know theyre suffering
and i know theyre dying everyday
but weve got kids here in the $unc$united $unc$states that are dying everyday too and being abused and neglected
sure
oh
and i dont know
i just have this problem with trying to heal the world when youre so sick yourself
you bet
so
right
we seem to agree on the jury thing
but well need an unanimous verdict
and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make a decision
yep
i think we should try it like you say
yeah
if it doesnt work we can always come back
but i think it would be a good idea to try it
i do too
so we all agree
good
good to hear from you
you too bye-bye
bye-bye
so i own a p c $unc$a $unc$t at my home
uh-huh
i could never justify owning a personal computer at home
thats quite an expense to look for
who is this
what do you use yours at home for
thats actually a good question
my wife works out of our home
she has an office
and in fact she sits in the office
and she uses it to compose and print out letters
okay
so thats a very regular use of it that she has
uh-huh
and in addition to that i tinker around with it
im a computer scientist
oh
so i write programs to do little things
im actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special
and also im interested in writing some programs that will kind of remind me of things like remind me that $unc$wednesdays is trash day and the like
im a electronics tech
years ago $unc$t $unc$i sent me to their computer school down in $unc$austin
uh-huh
so i learned to repair $unc$one
but i never really learned to operate $unc$one
thats a key thing
thats a
theres really $unc$two issues to that that theres so many software packages available today that just require no programming
yes
so that yo-
in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
but if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
uh-huh
but i think you really hit the nail on the head
for the average person is exactly what he can use it for
and if your wife isnt working out of the home and sending letters
or if you dont want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage
whatever
your issue is then there really
space is a handicap with me
i live in a motor home
i see
and im preparing for retirement
i see
congratulations on that
and im not to far from it another year and a half
yeah
actually $unc$one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
yes
definitely
but just like the computers
uh-huh
remember how they started out running $unc$three $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars
right
the calculators you mean
calculators
i beg your pardon
yeah
they sure do
yeah
i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum
you can actually buy a whole brand new computer not necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars
youre kidding
no
including a printer
i wasnt including a printer
but you can buy a printer now for a $unc$hundred dollars
so make it $unc$seven $unc$hundred
a $unc$hundred
yeah
wholly smoke
a respectable one
yes
uh-huh
of not being particularly interested i dont keep track of prices on them
but that does amaze me
yeah
the prices had plummeted
you can buy just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an $unc$eighty $unc$eighty-eight for about $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars
uh-huh
and then the keyboard is another $unc$fifty
the monitor with the card that drives is another $unc$hundred
and then the disk drive is $unc$two $unc$fifty
what is a good brand a inexpensive
thats the deal is youre not buying brands now
youre buying these knock offs
so theres
probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy $unc$one is theres a magazine called $unc$computer $unc$shopper
uh-huh
its a big magazine
its $unc$twelve inches the narrow side and $unc$seventeen inches the tall side
wow
and its probably an inch thick a $unc$thousand pages
but the magazine is full of these computer mail-order houses
and theyre all competing with each
uh-huh
so you just flip through there until you find a $unc$eighty $unc$eighty-eight computer
its the original p c
so its
we call an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m p c compatible
and youll find the monitors $unc$forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for $unc$twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me
and you mix and match
and then you do it by mail-order
but theres no real brands
its probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board
i see
how do you go about getting $unc$one of those a catalogs
theyre available in the $unc$b $unc$daltons that type of thing
uh-huh
youll notice that although its a magazine its large
and like i said its about an inch thick
uh-huh
getting back to the p c
ill tell you
i ya
first of all i dont like a machine thats smarter than me
and secondly i did learn this much about computers
they are pretty stupid because they add $unc$one and $unc$one up and come up with $unc$ten
in binary
thats right
theres great
anyway thats $unc$one ever my favorite jokes
yeah
$unc$one and $unc$one equals $unc$ten
yeah
thats great
course its kind of an inside joke
yeah
you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary
i understand
thats great
thats a good joke
so what
do you work with a computers at $unc$t $unc$i
i did for years
and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
and just recently ive changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
uh-huh
now i type that $unc$one
but i dont use it anymore
uh-huh
i just recently started using $unc$one in connection with my work
uh-huh
yes
i keep track of an inventory here
uh-huh
and of course now that is where a computer is very handy
yes
i agree
and its my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
yeah
im with the $unc$q $unc$r $unc$a lab qualification and evaluation
i see
thats fascinating
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated
uh-huh
and theyre dated
so i have to keep up with them
and its very handy doing it on the computer
yeah
i just run a printout every week
and it puts me right up-to-date what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned
uh-huh
so a
it is handy
right
and i must admit that up until i did start using $unc$one i had very little interest in computers
yes
but they are amazing
yeah
they certainly are
so lets see
so i guess with respect to the question
yeah
i guess weve kind of covered it
i think we did
great
nice little conversation with you $unc$jack
yeah
$unc$mike you take care now
good day
good luck to you
thank you
same to you
i guess ive had to return something
but cant decide
mostly its been because i didnt like the color
uh-huh
or im not sure whether ive had to return that many things
im having a problem right now with a computer that weve just returned
are you
for me its actually a pretty good topic
okay
good
so well talk about that some
yeah
we could talk about that
and then we could talk a bit about just quality of products in general if theyre better or worse like if they last longer or something like that
right
okay
im going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like youre
i-
let me tell you just a little bit about myself
for years i did all that shopping and whatnot
but for the last $unc$four or $unc$five years ive had eye problem
oh
and ive had $unc$two cornea transplants
shopping is no fun anymore
i can imagine
i dont
i cant see good enough
and its hard to tell what im doing
and its just aggrav-
you cant read labels
and you cant
i just thought of something we have to return
good
there you go
all right
itll come to us
okay
okay
are you ready
yeah
$unc$laurie all right
right
all right
tell me about your computer $unc$laurie
i think that sounds fascinating
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project
and we called up the company and asked them details on it
we bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper
uh-huh
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with
and they were very happy with the system
and they felt theyve gotten a good price
and we went in
we explained what we needed
and yes
we had to go across the $unc$george $unc$washington $unc$bridge to $unc$new $unc$jersey to meet these people
uh-huh
and so we went there
we told them about the stuff
and the guy said that the computer would fit our needs
and we
these things wont make any sense to you probably
but he told us we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer
uh-huh
yes
and its called a user boards
or slots is what its called
uh-huh
and he told us theres $unc$four $unc$sixteen bit slots and $unc$two $unc$eight bit slots available for the user
and we can put full size cards in there
and so we said great
well buy it
and we put in our order
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer
and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it
and theres only $unc$one slot we could put it in
lovely
and at this point we only have $unc$one board
so it wasnt so bad
so we used it a bit
but we tried to figure out whether we could put $unc$three in because we really need to be able to put at least $unc$three in
and
no
the computer was supposed to have $unc$two
it has them
but the problem is that you cant put the type of card that we need to put in it in it and even though they told us in advance that you could
i see
they told us there would be no problem because the salesman just doesnt really know
i see
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it
they probably didnt know what they were talking about
right
thats completely it
the salesman didnt know
right
so we went back in
and we struck an agreement with the people
who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards
okay
so they did that
and we said are you sure this will work
we dont want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesnt really work anyway and $unc$et $unc$cetera
and they were doing it at their own costs
so we said fine
and we went back
and we talked to the person a second time and things like that
and then we get the computer home
my husband goes to pick it up last week
and we couldnt go get it sooner because i just had the baby
and lifes just a little bit complicated
uh-huh
uh-huh
and he goes and gets it brings it home
first of all theyre missing components of it like cables so you cant really test it out
and then second thing we still cant put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it
jeez
and now were dealing with having to bring it back again
and they say they can do something different and change some connectors
and we hope so
but its a hassle
yeah
it really is
you know its just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on
right
and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction
right
i think thats the worst part
i
so some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation
and they said you dont have to pay for it yet
thats an advantage isnt it
yes
it really is
i think theres a lot not to be said for credit
but thats $unc$one thing to be said for credit
how it gets you some muscle where you need it
yeah
right
and so
and i think thats really important
because these guys if they give us a hard time were going to say you look
if you cant fix this to our satisfaction were just returning the computer
yeah
thats right
thats right
and if we do that
i just tell the credit card company dont pay the charge even though theyve already paid it
thats right
no
but theyll just undo the credit that they did to them
yeah
they will
thats right
they will
yeah
they will put the kind of clout on them that you cant really do
right
yeah
and
we
$unc$hal bought me small little jam box kind of thing
so id
i have my $unc$ninety-three year old mother living with us
and so she doesnt remember anything
but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help
uh-huh
and i thought if i had a nice little tape recorder so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace i figured this will be good
uh-huh
the first time i turned it on i was recording
and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing
no
okay
so after that then you couldnt get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
uh-huh
and then on the other side when i loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to videotaping they were doing
and she says its wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far
and so you cant get it to run the right way either
uh-huh
so
what brand is it
do you know
yeah
so i wish i could tell you
i really dont know which brand it is
its
but i was wondering
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy
we werent buying on $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m p c
yeah
and i was wondering if you
no
i think this is maybe a name brand
and i suspect that its probably just a fluke
i have the papers and everything
and were going to just take it back
but
uh-huh
do you buy it at some major store
yeah
i think it was like a $unc$highlands or something like this
$unc$highlands
chain down there that i dont know up here
do they have $unc$highlands up there
nope
dont they
this was a regular electronics store
uh-huh
so i dont think there will be too much problem
but i guess im not sure whether i think things are not made as well
i think they deliberately sometimes
i think a lot of things are not made as well
dont you
what are you
wel-
of course its hard to think of an exact example
yeah
but i jus-
thats good
theyre getting kind of a attitude of not
yeah
i like electronic stuff
yeah
for $unc$one thing i know their work
cars i think are not made as well as they could be
yeah
yeah
i think thats right
the fact that
because i
they want people to replace it after a couple of years
right
the fact that they have competition with the $unc$japanese and whatnot sometimes dwells on a fact that
ive known people who have had $unc$toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them
uh-huh
they may cost a little more
but they dont have to take them to the shop every other day
yeah
i had a $unc$toyota
and i loved it
yeah
my $unc$toyota did really well
it did a good job
so part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in the kinds of things we do so we make them better
good
yeah
and it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up
people
i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship
the people just dont care about what theyre doing
no
yeah
the whole
nobody cares nobodys really paying
yeah
attitude is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and on
right
give me my paycheck so i can go home
what im doing right
i think thats too bad
and its a shame too because when you get right down to it most things if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough
there isnt any way to get paid enough
yeah
but if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction
so whatever youre paid is enough
yeah
and also i think
i do research
and so im used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done
uh-huh
and you get satisfaction out of it
thats right
but i think things come both from the individual side and also from the company side
i think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction
because the companies that give the attitude that
youre the last one hired
so youll be the first $unc$one fired
and we just want you to do your days work
yeah
and we dont really care about you as an individual
yeah
when youve got that type of attitude on it the people dont care about their work
no
and so
it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately
starts with the $unc$one person that
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay
little value just in whatever you do
yeah
that the value is in doing it well
doing a good job of it
and
okay
$unc$jay where do you live in $unc$texas
i live in $unc$dallas
in $unc$dallas
right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a uh it goes east and west and a north south tollway
whats that the $unc$i $unc$thirty and $unc$central express
its
no
its called $unc$six thirty-fives the highway
okay
yeah
its the looper that goes around the city
right
and then the tollway is called the $unc$dallas $unc$north $unc$tollway
yeah
just moved here about a month ago after $unc$twenty-one years $unc$two miles to the east
is that right
how about that
so its a very different house from the typical $unc$dallas house
its a new home
its about $unc$eight years old
about $unc$eight years
its a duplex type thing very modern and very open and light
oh
uh-huh
so its different than the long $unc$texas ramblers
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
we live in a brick story and a half
whats your house like
$unc$cape $unc$cod style i guess youd call it
great
yeah
and have a big sun room on the back of it
so its got a lot of openness and light also
no
it doesnt
it doesnt have
thats what my wife really wanted
and so
with openness and light
yeah
thats
i understand that
i would love that too
our last house wasnt too bad
but it was just too traditional
uh-huh
and so if
yeah
this is very traditional
the next time probably a year and a half from now were going to try to build
uh-huh
so make $unc$one really contemporary and very modern and very open and very light
uh-huh
do you have children at home
no
i have $unc$three in college
$unc$three
boy
they usually get back at least $unc$two of them for the summer
but
you still need space plenty of space
still need a little bit of space
we have a lot less than we had recently
uh-huh
already cut back
uh-huh
how big is your place
its about $unc$twenty-five $unc$hundred square feet i guess
thats good size
its $unc$four bedrooms and $unc$two baths and that
yeah
we had
it has $unc$one wing built on thats a kitchen family room and then the big room on the back
yeah
we had $unc$four bedrooms $unc$two and a half baths in the place we just left
uh-huh
so now were down to $unc$two and $unc$two
$unc$two and $unc$two
uh-huh
uh-huh
so it wont be terribly wonderful when the kids are home
but it wont be that long because we not sure how long theyre going to stay or whatever
right
uh-huh
i was just reading an article that there were $unc$nineteen $unc$thousand properties available in $unc$texas for sale by the $unc$resolution $unc$trust $unc$corporation
yes
repossessed
yes
and if you can find $unc$one in the right area you can really pick up a steal
i guess so
we really didnt go that route and didnt look
but the planning of them
and the housing market probably still going to even go lower
there are many houses for sale just by the regular route
uh-huh
thats discouraging if you own property
yeah
and we just decided sell
and we got a pretty good price for what we had
not as good as it would have been say $unc$three or $unc$four years ago
few years
uh-huh
but that was just the timing
right
our daughter and son-in-law moved back up here hes from $unc$texas but course shes from here about a year and a half ago and had their house on the market down there
uh-huh
and they never did sell it
so they stayed $unc$six months
and she got her job back and he got a job down there
oh
because
yeah
theyre not moving very well
huh-uh
for sure
nope
and thats a good example of it
they live in $unc$rowlett
yeah
i know where that is
weve been here for $unc$twenty-five years
have you
im from $unc$missouri
and my wifes from $unc$kansas
so i teach at a college here
uh-huh
so its sort of home now
uh-huh
what college are you teaching at
im at its called $unc$brookhaven $unc$college
its $unc$one of the community colleges
oh
and its just about $unc$two miles to the west of where im living
uh-huh
so its very nice very convenient
the only one i know is $unc$richardson
yeah
$unc$richland $unc$college it serves $unc$richardson and $unc$garland
$unc$garland
uh-huh
and thats about $unc$nine miles to the east of here
yeah
so its good to hear from you
i enjoyed talking to you
and i hope we did them some good on their little computer dealy
i hope so
right
and have a good life the rest of it
okay
thank you
same to you
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
have a big family i guess
thats a start
i guess so
ha-
how old are you
$unc$twenty-five
so
okay
so you have been to some family reunions perhaps
i just got married
right
every $unc$four years on $unc$one side of my family they plan on having my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids
how long in advance do they let them know
we plan on it
its the third weekend in $unc$august
uh-huh
so its every $unc$four years
and so
so they all know it
yeah
and then arrangements are made during the $unc$summer for food and whos staying where because a lot of people are from down here in $unc$texas
uh-huh
uh-huh
and a lot of my family is in indiana
thats where im originally from
yes
so we usually meet at my uncles cottage at the lake and make a couple days of it
that sounds like fun
do they all have the small children too that come
yeah
pretty much
so all ages
yeah
and theres some my age
and then there are some a lot younger about $unc$four generations i guess
my husband on $unc$one side has an extended family
uh-huh
and they dont ever plan it like you do
uh-huh
i think if you can count on it every $unc$four years then people have it in mind
so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about $unc$six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because theyre rather socially active too
uh-huh
yeah
and so it seems by doing it about $unc$six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there
if they dont theyll say were planning to go to a certain place that weekend with somebody else
and were already locked in
but $unc$six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them
uh-huh
my parents are the youngest of very large families
oh
therefore they dont have many people left
yeah
and the few previous ones ive had
i havent known many of those people
but in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family
and thats been very nice
with
i have $unc$one sister and $unc$three brothers
uh-huh
and theyre only $unc$three out of $unc$five of us who have children
oh
so we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other
yeah
and thats kind of nice because my husbands family reunions are so large
uh-huh
and they dont see each other very often
we dont really know many of them
yeah
thats kind of bad
it really is
theyre fun
theyre a lot of fun
yeah
but still theyre not done on a regular basis
and you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before
yeah
its fun getting together with immediate family
a lot of my cousins are real close
and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that
so
those are the ones that are in $unc$texas
no
or you go to $unc$indiana on that
the ones in $unc$indiana
uh-huh
uh-huh
where in $unc$indiana
$unc$lafayette
$unc$lafayette i dont know where
i used to live in $unc$indianapolis
yeah
its a little north of $unc$indianapolis about an hour
yeah
yeah
its very pretty country in there i think
its gorgeous
uh-huh
so
i
when is your next one scheduled now
its like the last one was my high school graduation
the next one was when i graduated from college
so i guess about $unc$two more years
yes
and do you think youll have a baby to take back with you
maybe
i dont know
maybe
$unc$two more years
i dont know
probably
you need another milestone
yeah
i guess thats what
ive been married now for about $unc$nine months
so that was another milestone i guess
yes
im sure
and then all of your family probably has not met your husband
yeah
hes from $unc$indiana
is he
so they all met
yeah
and your both living in $unc$sherman
yeah
do you work to $unc$t $unc$i
uh-huh
uh-huh
and does he
no
hes trying to get in med school
so
uh-huh
we dont either
but i have a friend who is working on this project
really
yes
and
are they getting all the data they need
i dont know
i have a hard time getting people on the telephone
really
getting through to anybody
sometimes i call off and on all day
but anyway i guess were supposed to be talking about family reunions arent we
but i got off that
weve kind of exhausted everything i guess
yes
i think we have been talking probably about $unc$four and a half minutes
okay
and we both look forward to going to our next reunions im sure
yeah
but it has been fun talking to you
you too
thank you
and maybe ill talk to you again
okay
good
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
all right
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
yeah
few are basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
uh-huh
yeah
i grew up in sixties and early seventies
and my mom didnt work at all when i was growing up
she didnt start working until i was well into high school
uh-huh
so i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays its a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids
yeah
true
mine taught kindergarten
but she was always
i guess her schedule was shorter
so she was always home
always home by the time you got home
yeah
yeah
that statistic i guess has been growing every year
its like something around $unc$sixty $unc$sixty-five percent or so now
uh-huh
im not sure what the future holds for that
whether
it seems that theres a grass roots effort or whatever going on
i clean houses part-time
uh-huh
and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that dont work
thats unusual
theyre all
i think its kind of a new movement
its going back towards
women have come into the work force in the last $unc$twenty $unc$thirty years
and now theyre wanting to go back to the old days where women stayed home with the kids and try to give the kids quality time
uh-huh
and i think youre going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby
yeah
i think with the salaries that
a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are vice-presidents of companies
and i think with this it seems like its more the upper-class people
uh-huh
i dont see it as much like in my situation where i dont have children yet
but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids
but realistically im realizing thats probably not going to be possible for middle-class people to be able to live just on $unc$one income
yeah
that is tough
yeah
were looking at that now
my wifes about $unc$six months along
uh-huh
i think its going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
uh-huh
its going to kind of go along with the $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w in the driveway or in the garage or whatever
true
and the quarter of a $unc$million dollar home or whatever
yeah
im surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home
i would think it would be women that were working full-time
yeah
believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home
theyre real active in volunteer work
uh-huh
$unc$one of the women is real active with $unc$muscular $unc$dystrophy and does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis
but its almost like a job
she just doesnt get paid for it
i guess thats good that theyve got something to keep them active
yeah
when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home
or is she going to go back to work
yeah
were going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
what do you think
that
i would like to be able to do that
yeah
we think its that important
and i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction
im a counselor and a therapist
uh-huh
and i work with adolescents
and i see some of the problems the kids have when they dont have a real good family structure
yeah
i see a difference in even the generation before me were mom was like $unc$june $unc$cleaver or whatever
uh-huh
where the attitudes were a lot different
as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
there wasnt a lot of the drugs and alcohol and a lot of the things that are going on in todays society
uh-huh
i think morally it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards
true
the husbands roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure
and with women working so much theyre kind of pulled out of it too
yeah
so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
yeah
thats true
and thats contributed
and i think youre going to see a lot more of that in the future
yeah
maybe thats contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time
so if there was some way for women to stay home even if they could work
there are a lot of jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would at least in some ways bridge the gap
uh-huh
yeah
i think that in the future the family unit as it once was known is going to be nonexistent
what do you think
about
that as far as
do you think theres going to be still a family unit
or do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting
the balance
i dont
the divorce rate keeps hovering around $unc$fifty percent or so
and it got higher than that for a while
thats hard to say
families are such a strange configuration anymore
i see a lot of families where
in the back
i grew up about the same time you did
uh-huh
and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
uh-huh
nowadays its not the case
kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
and $unc$one of the reasons i guess is because theres so much more income in the family with both parents working
they get bombarded with junk
and they dont have to do anything around the house
they never learned to be responsible when
yeah
the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while
and they come back
and you got $unc$twenty and $unc$thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
so
yeah
you create a bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
yeah
so its not a real functional situation anyway
so i dont know that that trends going to change the single parent type families
and the families as long as weve got so many other crazy things going on in society
yeah
i think that eventually the family units just not going to even exist anymore
like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think theres going to be more single parent families than there are $unc$two parent families
uh-huh
thats pretty sad
yeah
it is
i guess unless theres a major swing in the change of whats important to people probably keep going downhill
and i dont know
we feel that we can make it on $unc$one income
it may be tough
but we may have to give up on some things
i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
yeah
and it will make the strain worthwhile
yeah
i think so too
i need to go ahead and wrap it up
okay
it was really nice talking to you
ive enjoyed it $unc$stephanie
and thanks a lot
uh-huh
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
have you grown up in $unc$dallas $unc$stephanie
no
ive only been here for the last $unc$ten years
where are you from
i grew up most of my childhood in $unc$germany
in $unc$germany
and
we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
theres a place id like to visit
so we travelled all over $unc$europe when i was very young unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate
thats neat
uh-huh
i was grade school age
my husband took a bicycle tour about $unc$five months right after the second world war
and so weve seen lots of pictures of the beautiful spots and areas
that would be to me a really nice vacation because im not in physical shape for something like that but i sure would work on it if i had an opportunity like that
yeah
thats neat
what kind of vacations do you like
my husband and i are scuba divers
h-
so we both like to go to dive resorts
we went to $unc$hawaii on our honeymoon
uh-huh
and we dove there
but we did about $unc$six dives while we were there
and we were originally planning on going to $unc$cayman last year
uh-huh
uh-huh
but we werent able to get enough people together for the trip
we had to have $unc$eleven people for this package deal
uh-huh
yeah
and we couldnt get enough people together to go
so it ended up falling through
yeah
we were going to get a really good price
when our children were younger we lived up in $unc$new $unc$jersey and used to like traveling into upstate $unc$new $unc$york and camping
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing
but weve never really did any diving or anything
little bit of water skiing
snorkeling
really
but not much of anything else
my husband and i both like water
uh-huh
so any vacation that we go on is usually close to the ocean or something like that
its got to be the water
right
when we were in $unc$jersey we used to go down to the $unc$jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot
they had a really nice beach areas there
yeah
after we moved away from $unc$germany we moved to $unc$new $unc$hampshire
uh-huh
and i lived there for $unc$seven years
i see
and i really enjoyed that because the mountains were real close
thats a really pretty area too
uh-huh
we like the white mountains
and unfortunately i didnt really get to go skiing much while i was there
yeah
i went skiing once
yeah
we loved the $unc$new $unc$jersey area too because the lakes were really pretty close
you could drive within $unc$twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really
uh-huh
and then we werent too for from the $unc$appalachian $unc$trail
we did quite a bit of hiking
which is kind of fun
are you a hiker or not
not so much
not really so much
if there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved i would be happy to go hiking
uh-huh
but we never have really planned a vacation around places to go hiking
so your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive
yeah
our next vacation will be scuba diving
im sure
you have any children
no
not yet
okay
then thats probably $unc$one of the reasons our
we had little children all the time
yeah
so some of the things are not quite as adaptable
yeah
its a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have children
yeah
it is
you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too
and
yeah
so i think wha-
yeah
and diving is something that
especially for small children
i think the minimum age for diving legal anyway would be probably about $unc$sixteen
yeah
$unc$eleven or $unc$twelve i would think probably
but maybe $unc$fifteen even
yeah
i know that $unc$one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family
we go wherever somebody is that we havent seen for a while
uh-huh
so thats kind of
we just came back from $unc$grand $unc$rapids where we saw $unc$one of our sons graduate with his masters degree in social work
and so that was fun
and the summer we have a reunion in $unc$salt $unc$lake area up by $unc$park $unc$cities where were going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together
so
that sounds like a lot of fun
ye-
our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too
yeah
that there were several $unc$hundred people
and they all kind of met at a central place
i didnt go
but it would have been a nice vacation
weve moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country
i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe like a small camper
uh-huh
weve travelled in a big one
i hate them because theyre hard to jockey around
but maybe a pickup with the back on
or something like the $unc$volkswagen $unc$vanagon ive heard is really nice
yeah
so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes
but you wouldnt want to do it all the time
yeah
we have enough friends here and there
i would just love to just drive through the $unc$united $unc$states and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and
uh-huh
my dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up
uh-huh
hes retired
uh-huh
hes in his sixties
and he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just not be settled anywhere
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think that would real
just see the rest of the country
and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for maybe a month maybe go
uh-huh
he does that quite a bit
and
he hasnt lately though because hes been ill
yeah
but hes been known to be gone for a month or $unc$two at a time
and hell say this is my itinerary
im going here here and here
and ill be back in about $unc$two months
yeah
there are a lot of neat places to visit in $unc$america
thats for sure
i havent been much to the south
i havent been in $unc$georgia or $unc$florida or $unc$mississippi or $unc$alabama
i guess those are the only states i have not visited
but up the coast in $unc$maryland and around there where the early history is theres some
$unc$johnstown and in that area is just really neat
interesting things to
so
uh-huh
have you been to a lot of the different historical sites
yeah
we took a trip around to the $unc$civil $unc$war battle grounds and things back in $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty when it was the centennial or something
uh-huh
i believe it was
had about $unc$three kids then i think
but that was a really fun interesting trip
we read $unc$bruce book before we went
and so we were ready to look up the places we read about
yeah
i think right now while my husband and i dont have any kids well probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things
yeah
and then eventually when we have kids
yeah
his folks did a lot of traveling across country
they went to the $unc$grand $unc$canyon and did things like that
camping is fun with kids
if youre
yeah
once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones
but even some little ones do pretty good
but when they get a little bigger they can help
yeah
thats a fun way to cut costs
and its enjoyable too
very restful
i find
yeah
i do enjoy camping
yeah
i find the outdoors very relaxing and kind of a change
as long as i have a shower nearby im fine and electricity
yeah
im with you
i need my creature comforts too
yeah
it was great to talk to you
it was nice talking to you too $unc$beth
okay
see you later
bye-bye
okay
bye-bye
what kind of painting are you planning to do
i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
uh-huh
and its a rent house
and i decided its too expensive to rewallpaper
so i decided im going to paint
uh-huh
and ive been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint
and im thinking about maybe sponge painting them either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look
what would be interesting
uh-huh
yeah
ive never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments
but they look very interesting
and you get some beautiful effects with them
yeah
$unc$one of the books that i bought where its describing the sponge painting said you can layer different colors
and
yes
yeah
ive seen that done where theres
i saw $unc$one that was kind on an ecru undercoat
and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color
uh-huh
and in between there was sort of a rust put on very sparingly
ugh
and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
yeah
what im trying to do is ive got yellow tile in both the bathrooms
uh-huh
so i want something thats going to tie that together
and im changing the fixtures out to make them wood
im going to put wood in there
yeah
that should be nice
so its going to have kind of a country look
uh-huh
and i havent even decided as far as what kind of paint to buy
i dont have an actual instruction book
so im really in kind of the beginning stages right now
its going to be a big experiment
yeah
i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
yeah
because you might find that its beyond what youre willing to put into it although i think it could turn out really nice
yeah
yeah
yeah
ive
i havent ever done fancy painting
but i sure did my share of just regular painting
ive painted several houses inside
no-
i never painted the outside
uh-huh
inside
what kind of paint do you normally use
we used a latex wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork
and my job was mostly the woodwork
okay
uh-huh
my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers
and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine trim work where id use a small brush and try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
only $unc$one of our bathroom has a window in it
so im hoping that it wont be too much of a problem
uh-huh
im wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i think
i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
no
im planning on taking it off
i have heard that theyve got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off
i tried to get wallpaper off once $unc$twenty years ago with just a scraper and wet sponge
and it took forever
i would not recommend that method
okay
if you can rent a steamer if its modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble
thats something thats worthwhile checking into then cause i
if its really old you dont know what its put on with
its hard to tell
its
the patterns look like theyre $unc$nineteen sixties style
yeah
and i know the house was built around the mid fifties
uh-huh
so it may be the original wallpaper
could be
yeah
if its vinyl it should be easier to strip too
if its paper it will probably shred
in $unc$one bathroom its probably paper
its silver and yellow and white
uh-huh
the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black
this was in a bathroom too
and the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white
and the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background
and then it had vivid almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
thats kind of an odd color for a bathroom
it was awful
it was absolutely hideous
and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it
and a guest went in there
and he said its a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations
really
after looking at all these design magazines and stuff im thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of tie in our comforter with a color thats kind of a burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design
uh-huh
uh-huh
and im not really quite sure
i dont know if maybe im biting off more than i can chew
id say tackle $unc$one project first and see how it goes
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
yeah
the bedroom would probably be the easier of the $unc$two because it would be just plain painting
sure
it wouldnt be any kind of special effects type thing
yeah
it would be just plain paint
its not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time
because if you use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out all the parts that you dont want to slop over onto you dont have to be quite as precise about how you do it
and it can be done a whole lot faster and with rollers and modern latex paints
okay
you can wash up easily because theyre water soluble
uh-huh
and they dry fast
so you really dont have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
and then if you discover the little tricks and tips about how you get through corners and how you do trim and how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when you pull it up
it peels the paint off when you take it off
yeah
not
if you leave it on for weeks it will do that
if you take it up the next day it should be fine
you want it to get dry but not just real hard
yeah
okay
you dont want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard
thats the problem
yeah
it will come up a lot easier if you dont wait too long
and i was told
i always used the nice wide masking tape
but ive heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it rips as you pull it off for $unc$one thing
really
okay
and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work
you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape
but use good stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
okay
i really appreciate all the helpful tips
i think you just made my project a lot easier
i wish you very good luck with it
and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business
the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets
and i decided that was too much to tackle
id hire a professional
if you were closer id tell you you could come over and supervise
if i were closer i might
i hope your project turns out great
and i really think that its exciting that youre going to try the sponge painting
i think that could give it a
well see how it goes
i may just be flat painting over it
of course thats the other advantage of paint
if you dont like it all you do is put on another coat
yeah
i guess wed better go because our time looks like its about up
yeah
i need to go to the dentist
so
okay
bye-bye
its was nice talking to you $unc$kathleen
thank you
bye-bye
i think i get most of my news in headlines from the radio
and then i follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion
im from $unc$new $unc$york originally
and now that i live in $unc$florida
i live in the $unc$florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime
uh-huh
and i feel that the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times
ive always read the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times when i was younger
and i try t-
now that it has a national edition i read that
i guess i do watch $unc$mcneil $unc$lehrer on $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s because i lean to that coverage
uh-huh
and i guess im
i like them
but they take so long
i dont always have time
yeah
there
its a whole hour show
its an hour show each evening
and we turn it on when we start dinner
we seem to start dinner around $unc$six and finish it up
uh-huh
i find that im leaning on
i travel a great deal even overseas
and i find that i lean on $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff
and im quite satisfied with the way they put it out
i dont believe everything they say
but its coverage
yeah
i think $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n does a pretty good job
i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the $unc$gulf $unc$war
yeah
yeah
and they seemed to have the best coverage
they had more information sooner than most of the other networks
yeah
i
$unc$peter $unc$arnet was reporting direct from $unc$iraq
i think this is scandalous the way everybodys picking on him
yeah
i think he reported what he saw
yeah
and if you didnt like it that was just too bad
i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted
but i think they said that frequently enough that you shouldnt criticize the man for giving us $unc$one perspective
yeah
yeah
no
thats right i think so
and i guess when it comes to magazines i dont read
i used to when i was younger
i subscribed to $unc$time and $unc$u $unc$s $unc$news and $unc$world $unc$report
i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper
or i also subscribe to something called $unc$world $unc$press which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the $unc$world $unc$press
uh-huh
which sort of gives you a different slant than
its not as slanted as the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times or as biased perhaps as the local paper
yeah
but that i guess and the radio
i listen to $unc$p $unc$b $unc$s radio a lot
and i also listen to these $unc$twenty-four hour news stations when im driving
i
yeah
we have a $unc$c $unc$b $unc$s $unc$twenty-four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work
yeah
and
do you read
are you from $unc$southern or $unc$northern $unc$california
northern
im from the peninsula
yeah
what is that
$unc$palo $unc$alto
the $unc$san $unc$francisco paper out there is the major paper
its horrible
yeah
and thats a terrible paper
the $unc$san $unc$francisco paper is just wretched
so i subscribe to the $unc$san $unc$jose $unc$mercury $unc$news
is that pretty good
$unc$palo $unc$alto is about midway between
its a whole lot better than that $unc$san $unc$francisco paper
and
what is that the $unc$chronicle isnt it
yeah
theres the $unc$chronicle and the $unc$examiner
oh
but theyre both run by the same peo-
yeah
they really are probably the worse papers ive ever read
i
theyre just horrid
yeah
so we read
can you get the $unc$l $unc$a paper up there
thats a pretty decent paper isnt it
or
we can
but i dont like it
yeah
so we subscribe to the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times and the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal and $unc$mercury $unc$news
yeah
yeah
thats another one i read
i forgot that
i read the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal
not as in depth as i used to because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
but
yes
again i read that $unc$two columns on the front
yeah
i agree with you that the problem seems to be they dont have enough time to do all the stuff
i feel pretty well versed in what im doing because i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports although i watch that
uh-huh
i spend a lot of time reading about these things
im quite interested
i find it very exciting for the coverage we have now today
yes
and i think we do get pretty good coverage
i dont feel that the american people is being shortchanged by the news coverage
if anything i think they list-
we almost have too much
i dont know
i hear a lot of criticism about listening to the $unc$dan $unc$rathers of the world and taking their word for it or their comment
i think they slant things
but
i cannot stand $unc$dan $unc$rather
i remember him when he was a local newscaster in $unc$houston
no kidding!
wow!
and i hated him then
i didnt know that
yeah
and i would not watch that man for money
yeah
and he and $unc$barbara $unc$walters just really turn my stomach
yeah
was he
so i watch $unc$peter $unc$jennings and $unc$tom $unc$brokaw sort of alternately
yeah
how do you feel about it
i guess i got to say if the subject is do i feel that were well enough equipped to
i dont know
if it said that i feel im well enough equipped
do we get enough news or something like that
yeah
to
do we get the news that we want
yeah
and i do
i really think
yeah
i think i do too
i think you got to segregate some of it
yeah
thats about all i have to say
okay
nice to talk to you
nice talking to you
bye-bye
bye-bye
we
taxes
everyone thinks taxes are too high im sure
but i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
what do you think
yeah
i think so
i think im a little out of the ordinary in that i think im more worried about the national deficit than a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something
and i dont know what to cutback on to get that settled
at this stage its hard to tell
and i know im out of it in terms of taxes
so im think that we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do for $unc$texas
and
at this stage i think weve taxed property almost to the limit because the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that its precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them
yeah
i think so
yeah
i know
i live in $unc$richardson
yeah
and its up over $unc$two $unc$thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
yeah
yeah
but now were getting public services the schools the hospitals
and if it werent for the taxes were putting in there look what the schools could cost you
yeah
yeah
yeah
now i
when we moved to $unc$richardson $unc$one of the reasons we chose it was for the schools and realizing that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to go for that because we supported the
yeah
then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent
and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
yeah
yeah
$unc$one of the
i dont know which one it is down there whether its $unc$hobby or the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition
if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
yeah
i think thats right
yeah
that would provide possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things
yeah
the so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount
but eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even
i dont know about that
i
yeah
i quit $unc$ten years ago
so i couldnt afford to start again
i see
okay
no
yeah
that would be true
that would be true
but
i know
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think
but all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the $unc$one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for $unc$dart which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
yeah
and even if it isnt going to provide you with any services in that its not doing to provide a route from your home to a business for instance
this is a thing
i think its like back east
you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities
you cant come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it
if we had been like a $unc$chicago or a $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city or $unc$philadelphia or someone like that and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and construction costs were cheap you could afford it
yeah
yeah
but now digging tunnels under $unc$central $unc$expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive
and
yeah
and the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
absolutely
whereas in $unc$dallas here those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the $unc$dart
and for instance all the office buildings and stuff that are out here in north $unc$dallas as opposed to downtown
to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the metroplex to both those centers of business plus everything else thats scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area like $unc$new $unc$york does
yeah
yeah
yeah
just take like in $unc$chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere
yeah
$unc$new $unc$york
and some people dont even own a car and know how to drive a car
yeah
right
right
someone made the analogy with $unc$texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse
an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street
most $unc$texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
yeah
and im just as guilty as anyone else
yeah
yeah
i drive to work every day by myself without even any thought of car pooling
yeah
right
and most people are that way because theyre used to not having public transportation
yep
yeah
so but here again i think i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for $unc$five years before they turned a spade of dirt and doing all these studies and the things
yeah
yeah
we saw about them traveling to $unc$san $unc$francisco to see whether they wanted or $unc$twelve foot wide cars or something
i felt that was a little wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
a little bit much
yeah
yep
yep
the c-
thats about all i can say at this time
yeah
i think so
i think that will probably do it
so
okay
its been real nice talking with you
good enough
bye
bye
okay
do you own a p c by the way
im guessing you probably do
i dont have one in my home here
my parents have one
and they live just about $unc$three miles away
so we use that one
i see
and my in-laws also have one
and theyre almost as close
right
theyre in $unc$richardson
uh-huh
uh-huh
and what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them
usually word processing something such as forms for things
yeah
also i have a $unc$nine year old that ive been home schooling for the last $unc$three years
and we got
the $unc$one that my parents have is an $unc$apple $unc$two $unc$e
uh-huh
and i have a sister-in-law who works in the $unc$fort $unc$worth school district
uh-huh
and so she got me copies of several of the $unc$apple for school programs
great
yeah
and so we use those
and theres some
whenever we go over and visit $unc$grandma the kids love to play the computer game
so thats part of it
sure
my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things his resume his letter
yeah
hes been applying for jobs and things that type of thing forms for his photography business and that kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly
yeah
im
my father had a software company
and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
uh-huh
and were hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here
yeah
but theyre kind of older
right
so im not sure that well be able to get too many other programs for it
yeah
yeah
im a writer by profession
and when i was first here in $unc$dallas or in $unc$plano this is been like $unc$fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because i thought theyre so wonderful
i have $unc$one of those
yeah
then
mines broke at the moment
but
yeah
ours really needs to have some work done on it
but then my husband worked at $unc$t $unc$i
this has been years ago he doesnt work there anymore but he got the $unc$t $unc$i professional and brought that home
and i learned $unc$wordstar on that
and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter
yeah
i learned $unc$wordstar
i did some typing for my father when he had the company
uh-huh
and so i learned that on there too
that was
yeah
have you ever used $unc$wordperfect
or
i havent
thats the $unc$one that my father
i guess i have used it once or twice
uh-huh
its the one thats on my father-in-laws computer
right
hes got on $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
yeah
yeah
thats probably where youve used it
so thats the program that theyre using there
uh-huh
yeah
i have that on my computer here
and also i do some work at $unc$u $unc$t $unc$d
and thats what they have there
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and already know the software
and i dont know from my own experience
$unc$wordperfect is just so much better than $unc$wordstar at least the version of $unc$wordstar that i used to have
it may be improved by now
but
thats what ive heard
yeah
$unc$wordstar was never very intuitive to me
you
some of the commands just had nothing to do with what they did on the computer
but
uh-huh
like going forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just didnt match with the kinds of keys you were using
yeah
you had to memorize it
yeah
and
but $unc$wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways
and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of research or anything like that where you have to use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes
thats neat
yeah
and if you put a footnote in the middle if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
how wonderful
so its just
i had heard that that was a better one
yeah
yeah
and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything
and it was just awful
so i dont know i think we have just become really spoiled
but i think its a nice kind of way to be spoiled
yeah
yeah
i agree
so i have not really paid much attention because i
clock
although i think weve probably been talking at least $unc$ten minutes
so unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
not too much
what kind of things do you write
i was a technical writer for many years
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company
i was a tech writer
and he was an engineer so i did tech writing for a number of years
go talk to $unc$daddy about it
excuse me
sure
go on and talk to $unc$daddy about it
tell $unc$daddy i unplugged it for you
but you dont need to drag it down the hall
got a problem
$unc$daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged
trying to figure out what all that was about
yeah
but i have
that was the majority of my writing although i have also done free lance magazine writing and some educational writing
and for a while i had a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman who is an artist
so i did some advertising and p r
but
actually im not working anymore
im a graduate student
so im doing a lot of writing
but now all of the scholastic majors though
yeah
ive done a lot of different kinds
but i just know right now that i couldnt have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers
so thats been really great
so im real spoiled
yeah
im anxious some day to have $unc$one here
yeah
im
and they just talked the other day about setting something up again
so hopefully pretty soon well at least have the word processing
uh-huh
yeah
my $unc$nine year old ive decided to teach her how to type using the computer
good
so
thats great
yeah
yeah
ive
those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on
and it seems like its getting earlier and earlier with the children
thats right
so i think that that would be a real advantage to her to have that and do it early
uh-huh
yeah
so d-
weve been writing a story together
neat
and i wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it
yes
right
great
and so i decided if shes going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
right
so well slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in
thats great
thats a skill that she can use for the rest of her life
so might as well start now
yes
yes
i agree
$unc$nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly
this is really going to be fun i think
yeah
and my husband is a ham radio operator
and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the
$unc$steve did you go to college
yeah
in fact im still going
thats good
so you probably could give some great advice
i dont know about that
but in fact im in the process of trying to choose a $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d school
uh-huh
whats your interest
your
computer science and cognitive science
uh-huh
so
thats similar to what
im in a $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d program right now
i see
and my area of expertise its information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than computer science
but my area of expertise is human computer interaction
yeah
and i think thats $unc$one reason why im part of this study because im working with voice systems
yeah
yeah
so good luck
i guess we should talk about giving advice though
what type of advice do you think youd give to a parent
to a parent
yeah
the thing is when youre a kid and the kid at that age especially if theyre going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want
uh-huh
yeah
and choosing from my experience i thought i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want
uh-huh
but i dont know
at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school
the size of it or
yeah
i think thats more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change
yeah
i know very few people that started in $unc$one field and stayed with it
they
i think thats what you just said having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school
i think thats much more important
id advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs
that some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer
but some of the larger small schools i guess around $unc$three or $unc$four $unc$thousand students can offer a broader range of curriculums and things
yeah
so if the kid does change they dont have to transfer
or they dont have to
i dont know they dont have to give up years of credit transfer and things
yeah
thats disruptive
yeah
i normally
and parents hate to hear this
because i actually teach college
i hate to talk to the parents
$unc$one of the reasons is because the kid doesnt know exactly what they want
and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if its not going to be your career vocation because youll get better grades
i think most employers would probably rather hire a $unc$three $unc$six in history to be a salesman than someone with a $unc$two $unc$oh in business administration
yeah
does that make sense
yeah
yeah
i see what youre saying
yeah
i always tell them that you should major in something youre going to get good grades in because thats always i think more important overall
yeah
i dont know
give me $unc$five minutes
yeah
youre at the office now
yeah
at work
yeah
yeah
im just getting ready to go to lunch
yeah
thats like what we were saying though
would you advise a private school or a public school
it would
whats the trade off there
what
i tell you
i live in $unc$maryland
and the public schools here are pretty good
i teach at a public school actually
and i know that the $unc$s $unc$a $unc$t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the private schools
and i would full time at a public school
and then right now im teaching part time at a $unc$catholic institution
i see
and i think im getting a better caliber of student at the private school because i think their parents pay more
and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
where at the public school i dont think as many parents are college educated
and i think because it costs less the kid doesnt take it quite as serious
th-
its the minimal cost
but i think you can get a good education at public or private
but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private
i
yeah
you have to look around at the school
i think the bad part is that most parents or kids dont know what to look for
yeah
yeah
i think i would agree with that
in fact im going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose
uh-huh
a particular institution might be better for my area
right
uh-huh
the $unc$university of $unc$small $unc$town in $unc$arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area
uh-huh
right
yet if i go to $unc$u of $unc$i or $unc$c $unc$m $unc$u or any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better
but its the same thing
theres what will the name recognition get me kind of thing
right
yeah
does it have a $unc$big $unc$ten football team
or
yeah
yeah
thats usually the basic criteria
yeah
yeah
is it a $unc$pac $unc$ten school
yeah
but i think
yeah
im at the $unc$university of $unc$maryland so in this region though i go to a smaller branch of the $unc$university of $unc$maryland my diploma will still say $unc$university of $unc$maryland
it doesnt differentiate on my diploma though i would put it on my resume what program i went to
but i think im actually at a smaller program
im not at the big $unc$college $unc$park campus
thats the big one with the football team
yeah
so i think youre right that theres difficult decisions there based on name recognition
when i first was applying for graduate schools i applied to some big programs in this area like $unc$stevens $unc$institute of $unc$technology which is recognized in the $unc$northeast as $unc$one step below $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t in a sense
yeah
so its got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school
yeah
and technical people know that
but i don-
yeah
i think youre right
you really have to think about that for the job
i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelors
and when i
i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs
i was going to be a teacher
i was just a high school teacher
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of
yeah
but then when i went for graduate work or for a new job people said to me $unc$shippensburg $unc$state where is that
yeah
yeah
and when i went into higher education even at other universities they werent aware of it
yeah
so i think yeah
thats important
i think it depends on if you want a regional job or a national job
you need that first job or so out of school too
yeah
yeah
i guess another thing that concerns me is it seems like everybody today is still in that job market
and where was i at
in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school
but there is also a whole other dimension the growing up while youre going to school part
uh-huh
yeah
and actually in the $unc$midwest especially a lot of the schools like $unc$university of $unc$missouri will have a main campus like $unc$columbia which is big multi disciplinary
right
and theyll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field
so youve really i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything
uh-huh
right
yeah
depending on your technical areas
yeah
yeah
i could see that
but i know that at $unc$university of $unc$maryland where i am in a $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d program i havent even met someone outside of my area of information systems except for
does your family normally have a reunion
do you have $unc$one
thats been
on my fathers side weve really there
uh-huh
on my mothers side weve had several
its not really on a regular basis
uh-huh
but usually sometimes every few summers
all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
right
so theyre pretty much just reunited always
uh-huh
so its just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
it might be a good time for you to start a tradition
i know
thats
you could be responsible for that yourself
do that
thats true
sure
how about your family
in my family lets see last $unc$october was the $unc$forty fifth annual reunion
wow
youre a pro at this
the first $unc$sunday in $unc$october the $unc$jordan family gets together
thats good
and all of the descendants of the $unc$civil $unc$war veterans come together
and they come as far away from $unc$california
and theres usually between a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty and $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty people
and then where do you meet
theres a big community hall in $unc$vernon $unc$texas
okay
and that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the $unc$texas family
okay
do you have relatives in $unc$vernon then
uh-huh
okay
right
uh-huh
a lot of the older family lives in $unc$vernon
right
all of his direct descendants have now died
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
so were talking about second and third great children here
right
i took them up until this year
theyre grown and gone from home now
so they take their family
right
but lets see
that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather
okay
so it would be the second great grandchild
and so they
okay
so this town hall that you meet in is that like a
its a community hall
its a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in
okay
and you just bring the covered dishes
every family brings a dish of some kind
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years
$unc$potato salad and
we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them
thats good
and we choose to bring congealed salad
you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad
right
and most of us are very conscious of sanitation aspects whatever youve got to carry for any distance
right
i always take home baked bread
thats nice
that happens to be my specialty for that family
i do other things very well
right
but there are others in the family who do them better
do they always have the $unc$one person in the family who everyone thinks they know how to make this the best so thats what they get to cook
uh-huh
thats good
i had a professor in $unc$anthropology at school who studied family reunions
so i learned a lot about them
i havent been to a lot
uh-huh
but we talked a lot about the rituals
uh-huh
you all equated the family reunions as with the $unc$protestant
uh-huh
it was the $unc$protestant version of the $unc$catholic pilgrimage
uh-huh
it was an interesting theory
she talked about the $unc$catholics
its all family centered anyway
so you usually are living where your parents live
and its all
you dont have to come home
so the $unc$catholics would make a pilgrimage in older $unc$europe
but when the $unc$protestant ethic happened in $unc$america there were people who ever went out and went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
uh-huh
right
but she had
it was interesting
i dont know how valid it is
but she talked about that and how the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and about the bread and the ritual placement
do you have a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every year
is there kind of a
salads go first and things like that
its
we have kind of a core group that serves as quote officers of the organization
right
and they plan the reunions
the organize who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there whos going to rent the tables whos going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer
and each year its done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
thats pretty
we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member
and theyre entered into a wonderful scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone
and it keeps the family alive even though its very fluid
sure does
thats wonderful
and theyre very dedicated to that
and its been really wonderful
it helps you hang onto your roots
yeah
i wish wed
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging
my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family
his family was very scattered and very diverse
right
and i got to talking to him
i said how is his nephew doing
i dont know
i havent talked to my brother in $unc$three years
i said well hows your brother doing
i dont know
my son keeps in touch with him i think
but i dont
right
i said hey wouldnt you like to know whats happening with these people
yeah
but im
its too much trouble
so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but $unc$one to our place down at $unc$lake $unc$tawakoni
wow
youre just
thats incredible
liked to kill me because i didnt have that group cooperation
i did it by myself
right
and nobody brought covered dishes
we had a great big fish fry
and i fixed a salad in a number $unc$three tub
right
and it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just $unc$one or $unc$two people helping
and we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them
and i told him
have you done this repetitively or just once
we did it that year
and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there
we sent invitations
we said please let us know if youre coming
it was when his step father had died the year before
and it
his mother was alone and so they came to support her
and then $unc$one by $unc$one he began to lose family members
thats
we had a problem with that
and it was difficult to hold them together
and then of course he died $unc$two years ago
so that family has gone down to $unc$one brother and $unc$one sister now
and it
i think thats what happens when they get scattered
the family unit falls into disrepair
right
was our problem
the first major reunion was probably $unc$six or $unc$seven years ago
uh-huh
and then the second reunion people who maybe had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought its not that big a thing this year
uh-huh
and so it kind of wound down
uh-huh
and then finally you get the $unc$shreveport relatives there but no one else
so that
uh-huh
those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive
theyll send out news bulletins
$unc$two or $unc$three times a year youll get a news bull-
hey guess who got elected to the legislature
or guess who our local sheriff
okay
okay
i
my children as a matter of fact are all grown now
so i am assisting them with their children in their selections
uh-huh
great
so
great
my children are grown
but theyre teenagers
uh-huh
so i have $unc$three children ages $unc$fifteen $unc$seventeen and $unc$twenty
uh-huh
and i guess about when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working at a preschool and doing some work
uh-huh
and then i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool
so i am around not a day care situation but in the child care environment
uh-huh
uh-huh
so
i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in todays environment than the one on $unc$one care is
uh-huh
when my children were growing up up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a home with a lady who kept $unc$two or $unc$three kids
and i felt like that home environment was very important to them
yeah
it was important to me
yes
and i feel that they had that $unc$one on $unc$one thats so necessary at that age
uh-huh
it is
however in todays environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because thats the way our young people are dealt with
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
in other words therere more people
theyre dealt with in packages
yes
yes
thats an interesting point of view
i
seeing the children in the school the way i do we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as $unc$three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at $unc$twelve months maybe and were even in there $unc$one day a week which is all our school provides for the under $unc$three year olds
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but still they have an opportunity to be with other children
absolutely
and it is true
but as far as looking for a place i think its very important to have very caring people to take care of the
absolutely
without a doubt
in a school if youre going to have the structure and youre going to have the large numbers youre going to need really
uh-huh
i recently stopped by $unc$mcdonalds
and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center
and of course she had just gotten her degree
and she was so enthusiastic
and she was excited about it
and she was going to accomplish all of these things
yes
yes
however when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal
yes
it is
and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really dont want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment
yes
thats right
that maybe
yeah
that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that
absolutely
and thats what i had the opportunity of doing
uh-huh
and i could concentrate on the creativity and really having a lot of fun with the children and providing them with a great atmosphere
uh-huh
they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that they pay
yeah
they are to be there ahead of time
theyre there early to receive the kids
and they have to be there at sometimes $unc$six oclock in the morning
thats right
which is
yeah
and then they have to work until the place closes at $unc$six $unc$p $unc$m
and then its their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they dont have cleaning crews in most of those
yeah
yes
thats true
thats true
and she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
yeah
yeah
and she
because people cant pay to provide and
uh-huh
uh-huh
ours is a church
and so we dont have the expenses of a building
uh-huh
we share the expense with the church
but we dont have enough
sure
taking care of a whole building and that responsibility
uh-huh
so it is a lot different
i know that when my youngsters were small
my older son was adopted
so he went into child care at $unc$two weeks
my goodness
and my younger son went into child care at $unc$six weeks
yeah
yeah
so they were in that environment actually up until they became $unc$seven and $unc$nine
uh-huh
and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them
however theyre going out into the school environment now
theyre under a lot of other influences
i need to be here for them
i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one who influences the way they develop
yes
so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their learning experiences and their development
you did
yeah
yeah
i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them
uh-huh
yes
yes
but when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that theyre going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
so i di-
thats different than most people do it
a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school
i know
thats right
once they get up in sch-
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but
i just felt very strongly about that
and i did not work as a matter of fact
my son was in the second grade
and when he started at $unc$skyline $unc$high $unc$school i asked him $unc$son where do i go to sign up for the $unc$p $unc$t $unc$a
and he said $unc$mom dont do that to me
please dont do that to me
so i knew it was time to go back to work
but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys
yeah
yes
thats true
and i was just really grateful i only had $unc$one bad child care experience
it was in a home
the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it
she was from $unc$argentina
uh-huh
and she was going back home
and i couldnt just wait for $unc$three or $unc$four months and then bring them back to her
yeah
so i had to find a new place
yeah
and i put them in this home
the kids cried when i took them
i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them up
dear
they were always cranky and irritable
dear
so i just took off and went there $unc$one day
and the children were left unattended in a room
they were not well cared for
how awful
so it didnt take me long to take them out of that place
yeah
yeah
but thats the only bad experience i had
the rest of the time they stayed in $unc$la $unc$petite $unc$academy
uh-huh
and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
uh-huh
they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didnt learn
but theyre going to learn it sometime
but for the most part they did have good care
yeah
yeah
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them
and in $unc$one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the $unc$y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because ive always been afraid of the water
uh-huh
yes
however my older son came home
and he said $unc$mom i dont like that man
said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had to get my face wet or id never swim
gosh
dear
boy
it didnt take me very long to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them
yes
and she said kids do exaggerate
but she said lets go ahead and send him another day or $unc$two days
and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly whats happening
good
yes
okay
what were you saying
do you work around children when you work
no
no
not at all
i work with computers
with computers
yep
they what
okay
do you ha-
$unc$one thing i
but you have friends that have children
i have some friends that have children not that many actually
uh-huh
what is child care like in $unc$new $unc$york
what is
i do not really know
excuse me
too much about child care in $unc$new $unc$york
does the company you work for have child care on premises for employees
excuse me $unc$one second
huh-uh
no
not at all
in fact my situation is a little bit strange
i was a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in $unc$france for awhile
and i have just come back and was doing consulting work
my
so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now
a sabbatical
and i might
i hope you can stay as long as possible with it
yeah
hopefully i can do some consulting work at home
and if i can do that it will
yeah
yeah
ill be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care
but i might start to go crazy with it too
right
it is a little
i miss the intellectual stimulation
right
but at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now
and
i think it does when they are real little
and they are changing every day
yes
theres
and you just miss the little things
yeah
and
i do not think i would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was $unc$one other child with a person
uh-huh
uh-huh
i would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young because i think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need
uh-huh
thats right
maybe if i needed to work part time like $unc$four hours a day i might do that cause you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time
but i just think that when theres $unc$two year olds running around the care givers are going to pay attention to the $unc$two year olds
thats right
and only when the infant screams are they going to go there
thats right
and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
right
and i play with her most of the time she is awake
and i think that is so important
right
it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother
yeah
such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important
right
and
our oldest grandson when he was $unc$eighteen months old went into a $unc$montessori day care system
uh-huh
and they took infants starting at $unc$six weeks
and they have a program that was devised by this $unc$montessori person
and a certain type of stimulations
and theres times of day even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things
they deliberately keep the room not real bright
uh-huh
and they have different things they will put them down on the floor
and of course they never have more than $unc$five
and they will put them down on the floor
and i think $unc$one of them was a little mirror
and some were just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids
uh-huh
and theres something about their eyes
yeah
shes just been doing all kinds of stuff where shes
how old is she
shes $unc$two months now $unc$nine weeks
yeah
and shes just drastically moving her eyes from $unc$one side to another and things like that
uh-huh
and shes just started that yesterday or the day before
uh-huh
uh-huh
so every days are different
uh-huh
and i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older
and i will probably be going back to work around $unc$january whereas she will be about $unc$eight or $unc$nine months old
a little older
and so i think she will be at a
i have heard its a rough age to put them into a
it is because thats when they are clinging to $unc$mama
yeah
so you might have a real problem with that
i think it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying
but i think it
so it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place
yeah
we are just going to have to see how things work out
but thats unusual
but i am trying to leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she is used to other people taking care of her
uh-huh
is it your parents or your husbands parents
my parents
my husbands parents are in $unc$france
so its a little bit harder
but during
shes met them already
not that she will remember them
but shes met them
right
right
thats nice when
i have $unc$three grandchildren
another $unc$one coming in $unc$september
and i
if they were where i could not get my hands on them i am afraid i would probably go crazy
uh-huh
i like that
are they all nearby
but if you do not have to put them in child care thats an ideal situation for you is to stay with them
as
or you can set up your work program and your husbands so that $unc$one of you is there all the time
yeah
thats wonderful for the child
but
if i work part time that might be doable
right
and if you do decide to go with child care you really need to look at what your options are and look at what they offer
drop in at times that are unexpected
yeah
the
right now the situation is so tight at many places that its even hard to have a choice
incredible
but since this is
people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i just find that incredible
and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon
and she is intending to stay home with the baby
and maybe do some free lance type work at home
and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i am hoping i can leave my daughter with her because my daughter will be about $unc$six months older than hers
that would be wonderful
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
it will be a little rough when she is a very very little infant
uh-huh
uh-huh
but when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families
and so she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day
and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work and not be bothered
right
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
we might be able to exchange that way
uh-huh
and so we will just have to see how things work out
but ideally i think business should have the day care centers there whether its the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether
i do too
they hire a couple of people
and parents come down to supervise or whatever
really well trained people
right
yeah
and have some kind of real good program set up so that when you go you can be assured that if theres an emergency that person in charge knows $unc$c $unc$p $unc$r or first aid
yeah
and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the right toys and the right setting and have an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule
yeah
thats real important to little kids
yeah
shes
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet
and its probably my fault because i do not have a real schedule now
uh-huh
but
they adjust to what the parents
yeah
shes been staying up late at night and sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
uh-huh
you know that works until they start school
right
and thats a problem
society is geared to a day person
and its
i have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this
they stay up until all hours of the night
all right
why dont you go ahead first and tell what kind of car youd look for in your next
i think i would like something like an economy car that gets really good mileage and one thats really reliable
i think probably not a brand new car
but maybe something like a $unc$nissan $unc$sentra or something like that
uh-huh
something my husband
and of course it has to have air-conditioning
absolutely
air-conditioning and a radio $unc$a $unc$m $unc$f $unc$m and a cassette player
and what else do i want
does it have to be a special color
i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice
a navy blue or a
it sounds like something your husband would drive right
yeah
thats what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work
yes
i dont think were looking for another car right now because we just bought $unc$one
but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts of course
and we wanted air-conditioning and a $unc$five speed
and that was kind of iffy
but that made it better economically
so
i think thats something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic
yeah
well probably have to look for another second car sometime
and wed look for about what youre looking for
but probably real cheap too
it wouldnt be a used car
but no
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
uh-huh
would you like $unc$four doors
or doesnt really matter
probably that would be a good idea
yeah
yeah
its hard for people to get in with a $unc$two door sometimes
thats right
so if we wanted it to take people out thats a good thought
i
that hadnt crossed my mind
it would be fun just to win $unc$one wouldnt it
yes
i would go for that
that would be great
all right
i think thats all that we need to say
thank you for calling
all right
well talk to you later
all right
bye-bye
bye
yeah
are you there
yes
okay
do you know the question for today
yes
its about why there arent more people that are voting and participating in
and what is your feeling
do you think this is vital important
absolutely
okay
do you
i think that its kind of discouraging to
i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing
and its really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not
a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea even that theres an election
and these are people that are registered
i have worked in some campaigns
and its the most discouraging thing in the world
im originally from $unc$oklahoma
and up there if they miss $unc$three elections then they have to reregister
and i have often wondered if maybe that would help the situation
i dont know
thats a thought
can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people
i dont know
i like that idea
i had a thought just a second ago
but it slipped my mind
thats all right
probably $unc$one of the reasons that people dont vote more is because they dont know the candidates
and i think sometimes
thats $unc$one thing that i have learned working in elections and things is sometimes even when you work for someone you dont really know what theyre like
i know theres been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for
and when they got in office it was just a disaster
and im not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them
im not sur-
the only thing is if they dont vote they have no right to complain
absolutely
it is
i dont know why we are so complacent
but im going to vote each time
right or wrong im going to cast a ballot
and then if im unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion
thats right
so there was something else i was going to
and im like you
ive just lost a train of thought that i had
but they have been little more effective in $unc$oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it
if you just skip $unc$one election
no
$unc$three
$unc$three
you have to skip $unc$three
uh-huh
and of course they can be a long time apart
but
i think thats an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it
of course
and this is not $unc$one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting
no excuse
im not sure if im familiar with that or not
okay
im sure all over the $unc$state of $unc$texas now you have $unc$three weeks to go for absentee balloting
uh-huh
and you dont have to be sick out of town or anything
there is no excuse
anyone can go and vote
i think thats great
do you
actually my husband has run for office before
and sometimes its nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because if youre going to be tied up that day campaigning or whatever it might be that just kind of takes that load off
you can just go ahead and get that taken care of
and
but that is an excuse i could live with
uh-huh
but this idea of anyone wel-
i am so bitterly opposed to this
if youre busy that has always been a legitimate excuse if you are incapacitated ill health
uh-huh
but to have the expense of
lets see
they have $unc$five $unc$six people at my polling place
they can come from all over the city
and i dont know why we couldnt have duplicate voting on some of this
hopefully once theyve checked them off the list
they do have to check them off a list when they vote
yes
i know
so hopefully they couldnt
but is every list checked as thoroughly as a
we
back in
when i lived
this is a subject that you never think youll be assigned to $unc$one that kind of comes up when youve lost the other subjects
no
as i was sitting there i thought the weathers been perfect
i dont know much to say about it
its
for the balloon festival here in $unc$plano it was just gorgeous
im from $unc$plano also
are you
it couldnt have been better
thats right
it didnt foul $unc$one launch
and thats kind of unusual
and its kind of cold in the mornings
so you dress up warm
but by
right
thats the only thing wrong i can find with it
i just got back from $unc$dayton
i spent the weekend in $unc$ohio with my family
how fun
and the trees are changing color there
i miss that
yeah
so that
as soon as we got out of the cloud cover
of course it wasnt sunny like it is here
it was real gray
yeah
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds
and i saw all those trees
it just really made me realize how much i miss the $unc$fall
yeah
i dont complain weather wise though because it was also $unc$thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning
and the high was only $unc$fifty
and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
ooh
so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things
thats right
yeah
im from $unc$utah area
and they have tons of canyons where the leaves change
and theyre gorgeous
yeah
you could spend every weekend of the $unc$fall going to a different area
we did that when we lived up in $unc$michigan
we went up to the upper peninsula
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
and then on leaf weekends which is this time of the year its bumper to bumper traffic
people as
whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road
yeah
its kind of hazardous for driving
yes
thats for sure
but i cant complain
i dont know if ive been spoiled
ive been thinking its getting cold sooner than normal
weve only lived here a couple of years
i think it is
and my family said that in $unc$ohio there was just an article on at the t v news that they are $unc$three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and the first frost
everything just happened $unc$three weeks early this year
well have to see how it goes
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal
but then were back to being warmer than normal this week or last week
so
just so we dont have $unc$one of those famous ice storms in the $unc$spring
i dont have to live through any of those really
a bad
nothing comparable i guess to what youve had before
ive only been here just a short time too
so i havent been through any of those either
so i have in $unc$michigan
but in $unc$michigan you can get $unc$twelve inches of snow
and life goes on
youre right
so as i understand it here if theres anything theyll call off schools and close businesses
they get ice
and no $unc$one can drive on ice
right
we used to think they were pansies
but then when you decided what ice was
right
the real definition of ice
so i think weve discussed it good enough today
i think so
it was good talking to you
it was nice talking with you
maybe well get the next time
okay
take care
okay
bye-bye
bye
hello
hello
hi
hi
my names $unc$gail
im calling from $unc$texas
im $unc$sandy
im in $unc$texas too
what a deal
took long enough to find you
really
yeah
seems like they take forever any more
did you hear what the topic was
yes
did she tell you
okay
yeah
great
if youre ready then ill just go ahead and start
okay
okay
hold on
okay
i guess were supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
yeah
seems like to me everything is just changing so much that its almost like you cant keep up with things any more
and everyones striving so much to make it equal between men and women
personally im a stay home $unc$mom
and i like it the way it used to be
so am i
are you
i think its kind of coming back around to that dont you
that theres a lot more people that stay home now than before
but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do
yeah
i dont know
i think sometimes some of the womens lib though is kind of like they wanted it all
and you cant have everything
uh-huh
theres no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be
yeah
and to me thats more important
how many kids do you have
$unc$two
$unc$two
uh-huh
are they young
or
$unc$five and $unc$two
$unc$five and $unc$two
i have $unc$two
and mine are $unc$two and $unc$nine months
so being home is real
i just am fortunate because i dont know a real lot of moms that get to stay home
and its just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning whos a working mom
and these people have secretaries and these high power jobs
and it just seems like
she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
and i just dont agree with that
i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and being more family oriented than not
it seems like everybodys always so busy with everything that theyre doing that theres no time for this and that and the other
and i hope it just doesnt get to where theres more and more women going into the work force
i agree
but i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you should stay home otherwise your children arent going to turn out or whatever because thats not fair to the single moms that have to work
yeah
or if they wouldnt be able to make ends meet not working or whatever
uh-huh
i think its got to be a personal choice
and its nice that we could have the choice to stay home
yeah
i find that whenever im in a group of people and were discussing things
just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadnt seen in a long time
and everyones all interested in what everybodys doing
and i had my baby with me
and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me
but its like here these people are
theyre going to school getting degrees making all this money
and they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages because i didnt have really all that much to talk about where career and things like that were concerned
and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes
yeah
which is too bad because obviously i dont get paid for my job
but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home
yeah
thats what i figure
im worth a lot just for what i do every day
but i dont know
this is kind of a
at least here ive noticed
im not from here
im from $unc$colorado
but ive really noticed that there are a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home at least in the circles ive travelled and in the church that i go to
that
men dont treat you like you dont know anything generally speaking
yeah
and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as job sharing or even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff
and i think thats really important that they do that
yeah
and they realize theres a need for that
and i dont know
i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work
and it wasnt where i had to be there every day
but we were going to the doctor once a week
so i dont know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
yeah
yeah
i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem
definitely
do you see anything wrong with public school systems
yes
i do
i think im concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way
i think maybe weve given our teachers a almost impossible job
i agree
do you
do you have children in the public school system
yes
and i taught for $unc$fourteen years before we moved to $unc$texas
is that right
and the $unc$one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much
i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children
you were a bookkeeper
oh
everything had to be documented
and i had file cabinets that werent filled with neat stuff for kids
it was filled with documentation
no
yes
i have $unc$three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back
and im just really in a dilemma if thats what
i love to work with children and to teach them
me too
but im really having questions if i can deal with that system and have a good conscience about what i do
i dont think its the teachers
i think its the system
i think so too
but
theyre so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency
right
and its not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best
shes always worried whos looking over her shoulder
and
what childs going to say something some parents going to overreact to
thats right
i know
thats true
its hard on the children too
i think because the teachers are overworked
and just like a $unc$mommy thats overworked youre not at your best
thats right
do you have children in the system
i have $unc$two
i have in the system
$unc$one is in ninth grade
and $unc$one is in seventh grade
and them
im home schooling my kindergartner this year
oh
we live in a district that has open classrooms
and i wasnt particularly comfortable with that for her
yep
are you in $unc$plano
yes
yep
i am too
you too
and i have $unc$one in ninth grade at $unc$clark
and $unc$one at $unc$hendrick this year
and my sixth grader came from an open classroom at $unc$matthews
and the very first year i taught back in $unc$seventy-three we had open classroom
and it didnt work then
oh
and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here
still at it
the explanation i was given about
they seemed to admit that it wasnt working
but they didnt have the money to restructure
but looks to me that it wouldnt take really that much money to at least come up with some kind of partitions
partitions
or just to face the children different directions or to do something
just
yeah
i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school
goodness
so he spent all day in this $unc$one large open area
oh
so i didnt really care for that
it seems like the schools in $unc$michigan were much better than they are down here
were they
that was our last tour in $unc$michigan
we were from $unc$north $unc$carolina
and of course $unc$north $unc$carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education
i think they rank about forty-ninth
oh
but our children got a very good education there
uh-huh
they were in the magnet school program
from the time they were about third grade they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons
but a lot of their classes there were only $unc$eight or $unc$ten children in their classes
wow
and it was wonderful
yes
so im coming to $unc$plano thinking gosh its going to be really great
its ranked so much better
yes
thats right
we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system
isnt that interesting
i dont understand how they get this reputation unless its just that they spend a lot of money
i dont know
probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
i guess so
my son is at $unc$clark this year too
so were
as a freshman
yeah
yep
and hes pleased with his classes
i dont guess ive been in the high school long enough to know what to expect really how to judge it
yeah
my daughter seems to be having a good time
she was absent with strep throat the last $unc$three days
and i ran over and picked up her report card
and she did very good
and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect for a freshman to have
thats good
yeah
shes not bogged down
but yet she has some every night
$unc$eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesnt have any
so thats interesting
but his grades i havent seen them yet
but supposedly theyre good
so
yes
you always hear how good
now my sons at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful
but who knows what hes going to bring home
thats right
i did hear the end of the prompt this time
was that you that we didnt hear the whole prompt
yes
yes
and it said do we think that certain crimes should fit certain punishments
and i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that i really wish that there was some way to send a message to people about child abuse and things like that
uh-huh
that
those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment
too often i feel that people get off without
yeah
i agree with you although i will say
im not sure
i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have was because they were abused as children
and the parents are saying hey wait a minute
we didnt do anything like that
uh-huh
and i guess before id like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be an absolute certainty like caught at it or something
uh-huh
right
right
or if they severely beat up on a child i would have absolutely no problem at all with
yeah
i dont buy the routine theyre just sick
or they were abused when they were little
uh-huh
forget that
yeah
sometimes they even wonder when criminals plead temporary insanity for crimes that are so severe and then they get sent to a mental institution
uh-huh
and they play loony for a while
and then theyre back out in public
but i cant see that either
i dont feel that that should be any excuse at all or any reason to not use capital punishment
yeah
yeah
i agree
i agree
because we
i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody i was crazy
so my family may say that on occasion
who knows
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and too they can always be blaming the other person
she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet shouldnt be an excuse
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess a lot of
and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some $unc$miss $unc$america was abused by the man she loved
and
thats the new one
is that the new
i just happened to see the headline on it
and i couldnt realize if it was the husband or the father or what
but i thought if children are being abused im wondering how our school system is failing that theyre not even seeing this
if it was that severe that when theyre later in life adults that its all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasnt shown up at all when they were younger
and that kind of worries me with my kids only being under $unc$two and not having to deal with that yet
but still
youre right
and yet did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this
never
no
and i lived in $unc$california which i feel like $unc$california
anything can go on in $unc$california
ye-
yes
but i was from conservative $unc$wisconsin
and there was nothing on it
which makes me wonder if its as prevalent as some of them claim
yeah
its
you just dont know
and it all
unless theyre caught in the act or the child is very badly beaten up it comes down to a $unc$one word against the other that type thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
$unc$texas is capital punishment for
it used to be just capital murder
and now they added mass murder
are those the only $unc$two things that we
i really would have no idea i dont really know
because i have a feeling it is
and i think there ought to be more things added to it
uh-huh
that would be pretty lenient in my opinion
yeah
i
killing a child or kidnapping
and possibly not
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt
if they release them $unc$two hours later he probably doesnt deserve the death penalty
yeah
that
or ive heard when i
okay
ill just go with you first
what kind of eating out do you enjoy
okay
i like dining out
of course it means that i dont have to cook
right
but im a divorced woman
i have $unc$one child
uh-huh
and when we dine out we go to medium priced restaurants
uh-huh
i dont particularly
i think its sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant
do you go home cooking like black-eyed pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria
not really
we go more for the chinese and italian and stuff like that mexican stuff that i cant cook
me too
uh-huh
mexican
uh-huh
we do too
we do the same
yeah
what are your favorite places
i like chinese food
uh-huh
theres a little place down on what is that $unc$coit $unc$road $unc$chinese $unc$pavilion or something that is really good
uh-huh
and i like it
and i do like chinese buffets
yeah
weve gone to $unc$august $unc$moon
and we think that was real good
uh-huh
but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to $unc$taiwan or $unc$may $unc$dragon
uh-huh
and those are excellent
theyre really a nice place you could take someone to eat
right
its not the rinky chinese decorations
uh-huh
but its a very elegant nice place to eat
uh-huh
very often we go out for fajitas
thats
my husband has just gotten stuck
oh
and we go to $unc$on the $unc$border and lots of places that have i think
uh-huh
and some of those and get fajitas
and hell just eat chips until weve got $unc$three or $unc$four baskets coming back
uh-huh
and then last weekend we went out for $unc$italian also
and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
so we went to $unc$el $unc$sorrento
ha-
yeah
have you ever tried pappasitos
it was fun
you know what
thats real funny you said that because we were coming back $unc$sunday on $unc$central from church
and $unc$bob pointed to it
and he said i keep hearing good things about that place
were going to have to go
it is delicious
thats what he
tha-
in fact youre about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that
uh-huh
so i guess well have to do it
its
you always stand in line when you go
thats what
but its worth the wait
$unc$d $unc$magazine said that
it said there was always a line
uh-huh
but thats a good sign
uh-huh
and have you ever tried the $unc$macaroni $unc$grill up on
yes
we did
my kids didnt like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna
uh-huh
and most of those things were a little more northern $unc$italy
right
and they like just the traditional
theyre not very
theyre the $unc$spaghetti $unc$warehouse type
yes
they are
exactly
exactly
right
the place of the seventies
yeah
yeah
but my little girl likes $unc$spaghetti $unc$warehouse real well
uh-huh
yeah
most kids do
its real entertaining for her
w-
do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing
not really
a steak is something that i cook at home that you grill out
uh-huh
yeah
and i really dont particularly
im real curious to try this $unc$one that has such commercials that $unc$del $unc$lincoln
and what is that guys name
they do those real corny commercials
theres $unc$one over there in $unc$addison
i cant remember his name
anyhow its some
steak
yeah
its some famous steak place over in $unc$addison
theres a second one downtown
and they have these really corny radio commercials
uh-huh
but their steak is supposed to be wonderful
so i had not tried that
my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
uh-huh
and it seems like ive been
we found those $unc$one time
and then they discontinued
it was over in $unc$addison
and then they closed up
yes
so most of these places are pretty much just theme restaurants around here
right
i think thats what really goes right now in the $unc$dallas area
uh-huh
of course next to downtown up around $unc$mckinney and everything theres a different class of restaurants up there that i cant even touch
uh-huh
thats exactly true
thats right
thats right
yeah
thats right
it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have $unc$one meal up there
thats e-
yeah
thats right
uh-huh
but
i had a friend who was taken to lawrys downtown for prime rib
uh-huh
and i havent been
we usually dont go for beef really anymore
uh-huh
where
weve gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that thats usually the way well go if were not going lasagna
right
uh-huh
yeah
when i go out its normally to get some specialty type of food
uh-huh
besides chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home
uh-huh
i know
i understand
and really theyre a lot better than what i get in the restaurant
thats right
and save you some money too
thats right
saves you a little bit money
whats your childs favorite place to eat
favorite place
she has a lot
$unc$taco $unc$bell
yeah
theyre easy
yeah
thats right
yeah
thats right
mine enjoy that too
they like to go pretty much where we like to go
and theyll
uh-huh
and then our favorite thing on $unc$fridays we generally order pizza in
so not $unc$pizza $unc$inn but pizza to our house
right
right
uh-huh
so weve done
is there anything else youd like to discuss about it
no
not that i know of
i think its come to an eye conclusion
so ill talk with you later
thank you
uh-huh
thank you
bye-bye
bye-bye
now were ready
do you have a personal computer
we have one
you do in your home
yes
yes maam
i do not have one in my home
i use one all day at work
but i dont have one at home
do you wish you
do you find you use it a lot
i dont use it as much as my children and my husband do
actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college called micro computers $unc$one $unc$o $unc$one
and were just touching on data base spreadsheets and word processing and just different kinds of storage
and were just kind of touching on a basic computer
uh-huh
uh-huh
what kind do you have
we have an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m compatible
its a $unc$gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs
uh-huh
uh-huh
that sounds interesting
yeah
what kind of a computer do you use at work
i have a $unc$p $unc$s $unc$one $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m type
uh-huh
and i use it all day at work
and i put all my personal stuff on it at work
uh-huh
so i really havent had a need for $unc$one at home
but probably if i didnt have access to one all the time at work id want one at home
right
i worked on my airline $unc$apollo $unc$focal $unc$point computer for about $unc$four years which was different
uh-huh
yeah
but i didnt
what is that tracking the flights and things
right
right
how long are we supposed to talk on this
they tell us when were through
okay
okay
this is my very first time
they come in and tell us
have you just started doing this
really
yes
theyll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now
and its time for you to wind up in the next $unc$thirty seconds or something like that
okay
its not more than $unc$five min-
uh-oh
but im going to ignore that
thats a call on my other line
so im just going to ignore it
okay
but
okay
i have that too
its kind of a hassle when you have this
but other times it
where do you work
i work at $unc$texas $unc$instruments
you do
yes
of course
i sure do
of course
thats why youre making these calls right
no
im doing this at home
im already home for the day
i see
this is a pretty good deal
i cant do it at work
i work in the legal department
so im pretty busy
uh-huh
but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents
we use $unc$word $unc$perfect $unc$lotus
uh-huh
you do know $unc$lotus
thats great
thats something we want to learn
yeah
its really
i love $unc$lotus
i think thats about my favorite
ive heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it
uh-huh
thats great
it really is
and i know theres still a $unc$hundred things i dont know how to do on it
uh-huh
but you learn something every time you use it
i have a question
on this survey or whatever i volunteered for
uh-huh
do i start calling in myself
or do i wait for people to call me
you can
did they give you a number to call
right
and $unc$eight $unc$hundred number
you can start calling in whenever its convenient for you
but you can only make $unc$one call a day
only $unc$one a day
yeah
if youve talked to someone like youre talking to me now and i place the call this counts as your call
right
so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow
i see
okay
so then do you get the $unc$five bucks
or do i
no
we both do
we both do
thats a
didnt they ask you for your i d number when you answered
right
i had to put that in
okay
so you both do
thats a pretty good deal
from what i understand
why are we doing this
its for research
actually im doing this for a friend of mine
its a research type project on voice activated electronics
uh-huh
oh
to
its
its almost like a voice command computer type thing
they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
uh-huh
uh-huh
theyre doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this
i dont know everything about it
thats wonderful
but they try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this
and that way they can check voice patterns
i see
different kinds of voices and things
uh-huh
and get the computer where it recognizes voices
wonderful
see thats why its interesting because im going to say you have an accent
i probably do because ive
and i think that i dont
to you
but
i was born and raised in $unc$texas
have lived here forever
so i probably do
and youre in what city
im in $unc$richardson
its right outside of $unc$dallas
okay
$unc$one of my sisters lives in $unc$plano
uh-huh
and thats right outside of
richardsons right between $unc$dallas and $unc$plano
how about that
i probably went through $unc$richardson then
you probably did
and then i have a sister that lives in $unc$austin
uh-huh
but
what are you doing way in $unc$washington
were actually all from $unc$nebraska
they just are recently moved there
my brother-in-law is $unc$director of $unc$admissions at the $unc$university of $unc$texas in $unc$dallas
uh-huh
thats interesting
yeah
and then my sister works at the $unc$air $unc$force $unc$base
uh-huh
so i imagine they use personal computers
actually yes
they both have personal computers
do they do their correspondence on it
i think they just send $unc$christmas letters on it
uh-huh
as far as i
mostly my $unc$one sister uses hers for her children childrens games
uh-huh
what i believe is $unc$one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that we do not have enough discipline
uh-huh
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
uh-huh
uh-huh
i agree with that
when i went to school i know i was scared to death about being disciplined
you were
and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different
uh-huh
uh-huh
i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
yeah
yeah
yeah
from what i understand they act up pretty bad
yeah
thats right
thats right
what grade is your daughter in
my daughters in the fourth grade
uh-huh
uh-huh
and theres children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and when i went to school that just wasnt put up with
no
uh-huh
they always had a paddle in our school
uh-huh
they just dont do that any more
i know
but the school systems afraid of getting sued and all sorts of lawsuits im sure because of things like that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and i also believe even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid
and we still dont have enough money put in toward public school
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems
yeah
wasnt that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it
yes
supposedly thats what its suppose to go for
and well just have to wait and see whether thats approved or not
uh-huh
i dont know your feelings toward that
i guess we shouldnt get into that
and what else
i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire
uh-huh
i have heard stories from other parents that i know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
uh-huh
no
really
yeah
ive heard some horrible stories about high school teachers
uh-huh
and to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school
uh-huh
thats basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system
with what they have to work with i think theyre doing a pretty good job right now
i do too
i think theyre doing real good job
uh-huh
so
but then what do i know
i dont have any kids
no
none at all
yeah
okay
so this is probably a real hard subject for you
yeah
yeah
okay
i guess we can discontinue our call now
okay
it was a joy in talking with you
it was good talking to you too
okay
thanks
well see you
bye-bye
bye
what do you know about latin american policies
i think theyre kind of ambivalent really
i just have a feeling that weve kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations
uh-huh
half the time we dont know who to support
that and maybe its tough for a big powerful nation to deal with countries like that that depend on us so much without running their country for them
right
but
thats just it
its got to be tough
but you still have to let them know how you feel
right
i guess my concern no matter which side we take were going to have supporters and were going to have antisupporters i guess for lack of better term
and like you said theyre such small countries that were bound to upset somebody
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
yeah
it worries me that the economy of so many countries in $unc$south $unc$america and $unc$central $unc$america depend on something that damages people like cocaine from $unc$columbia
right
and of course im sure we have some enemies down there who wouldnt care what happened to us
right
but thats a tough deal
thats true
and it
i dont think that
maybe its im reflecting how i feel about it
but i have a feeling that we really dont understand basically the competing factions in lot of those countries
and theyve been hammering for the last you know $unc$ten centuries
sure
and its still going on
and we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how some times
yep
thats about the lump sum of it
i was speaking with a woman
i believe she was from the $unc$honduras or $unc$guatemala or somewhere in there
no
she was from $unc$el $unc$salvador
yeah
and she was from a relatively wealthy family
and when the $unc$contras came into power of course with
gosh darn whats his face
hes in $unc$florida jail now
$unc$marcos
yeah
yeah
no
$unc$marcos is $unc$philippines
yeah
im blank on it
you know who im talking about
i can see his face forget his name
yeah
i know it
anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybodys property just assigned it to himself
yeah
kind of nationalized it for himself
right
right
so shes been a real strong supporter of the $unc$sandinistas and has been trying to back the $unc$u $unc$s government in that respect
and in that respect i have to agree that i think were taking the right stance because they were a democracy turned
yeah
dictator
yeah
right
yeah
basically a dictator fascist
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing
unstable
sure
what do you think of this $unc$u $unc$s free trade agreement were working on with $unc$mexico
i think its long overdue
uh-huh
i just
theres so much difference in the economies of the $unc$two countries i have a problem with whether its going to work or not
it seems like theres
and i
this may be unfair to $unc$mexico
but it seems like theres a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times
uh-huh
$unc$mexico
the mexican government is trying
and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to make themselves americanized i guess which is great because thats what they basically need to do
yeah
the big problem with the $unc$united $unc$states is we have our basic $unc$nine to $unc$five schedule
yeah
and we dont have the $unc$siesta
yeah
and the cultural differences its whats really hurting the mexican people because theyve had their way of life
and weve had our way of life
and
i think their version of the good old boy network going that
has a lot
let me just start by asking what you think of this $unc$middle $unc$east affair weve got going on
i think that its time that we concentrate more on whats going on within our own borders than whats going on in the $unc$middle $unc$east
i have to agree with you there
i think that for once we shouldnt even be at these $unc$mid $unc$east talks because with the exception of our hostages we shouldnt have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is
just let these people fight it out
i agree
weve got so many domestic problems
and what does it cost these people over there
absolutely
so how about the $unc$soviet $unc$union
what do you thinks going to happen there
the break ups
i think thats great
im glad to see that
but again i dont want to see us pour a whole lot under any circumstances because i dont know
im a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something its worth more to them than if you give it to them
and so im not much in favor of it
but im glad to see us advising them
uh-huh
that doesnt seem to cost a whole lot of money
thats right
thats right
but im ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda
even if it doesnt work at least he is somebody who is working on that problem
and i havent seen that in the last $unc$eleven years
so they dont seem to have a clue
all ive seen
$unc$reagan obviously wasnt too concerned with the domestic side of his political affairs
i think bushs kind of followed suit
international is important
but weve got a budget deficit that just wont go away unless it gets seriously addressed
and then theres the homeless issue
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think
and we wouldnt have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that were spending
i agree
once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the world bank as far as aid is concerned
right
and i think theres a limit
and we passed it a long time ago
i agree
weve been writing off way too many country bad debts
yeah
thats another thing i dont understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
to me that just doesnt make any sense
as much in debt as we are
i know it
i dont know
i think its definitely time for a change
but i dont see anybody
i dont understand too why we have to have $unc$democrats and $unc$republicans
and its either $unc$one way or the other
it seems to be were turning into a black and white society
right
you either do it this way
or you do it that way
and theres no in between
thats right
youre either liberal or youre conservative
and it obviously isnt working
i think it wouldnt hurt
and i know the $unc$independent partys been trying for years to get a real force in $unc$congress
but youre right
theres just too many issues that come up that our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because its a democratic issue or its a republican issue
yeah
and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel i think we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
i agree with you
of course we have the national embarrassment in our state $unc$jessie $unc$helms
and as soon as we can get
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he just lines up people against him
so its not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions
hes usually on the $unc$ninety-eight to $unc$two side
hes the $unc$one of the $unc$two that votes
hes $unc$one of the $unc$two
yeah
hes very ineffective i think
lets see
$unc$senators are in for $unc$six years right
right
and when did you guys vote him into office
unfortunately $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety
youre stuck
yeah
were stuck with him for a little while longer
but unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great
i hate
okay
what do you do on your yard
typical lawn stuff
$unc$saint $unc$augustine with a little $unc$bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas
uh-huh
uh-huh
and really all i do to it is
in fact i didnt even fertilize it this year
i just mowed it
and i mow it with a mulch mower so the particles fall down
comes back in the yard
yeah
so you dont have any one do your yard
you do it yourself
i do it myself
yeah
we do too
have a lot of people trying to do it for me
isnt that the truth
a flyers on every door every day
hey i need the exercise
so what the heck
thats right
my husband does the same thing
he does the yard
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower
but i keep putting off learning
hey youve got the right idea
thats right
but i had recently gone out and planted mums
we had decided to paint the front of the house about $unc$three weeks ago
and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about $unc$fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloways
uh-huh
and put out yellow and bronze
and theyre just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town
and she says those are going to die just the first frost
she said you should have done pansies
and i went now you tell me
yeah
so the first night that around halloween
and we went out and covered them with a sheet
and they did okay that first night
but the second night we were at the movies and didnt do it
so i guess ive lost them
i havent gone out to check yet
yeah
i dont blame you
i wouldnt want to look at them
no
listen
but the worst problem weve had here with this grass was about the third year we were here
i guess it was about $unc$four years ago
and we did not know in $unc$august to put down whatever it is for grub worms
uh-huh
and the next spring i guess in that $unc$march every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed wed have big whole patches come up
have you ever seen it what grub worms do
yeah
yeah
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it
it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt
so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything
it took a lot of money and a lot of time
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every $unc$august is put down that $unc$diazinon
yeah
you think thats what it was
yeah
we found them
okay
yeah
we found them
we dug under there about an inch
and you could see them
theyre real fat little white things
and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
yeah
yeah
those kind of brown what we call $unc$june bugs
yeah
but in the
uh-huh
and some people call them $unc$may beetles
yeah
$unc$june bugs is what id heard them called
so occasionally i find them in the flower beds
they said that every yard has some
yeah
but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
so thats the number $unc$one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
yeah
i had some of that problem
but mine was freeze
yeah
that too
$unc$two years ago or last $unc$christmas is that what youre talking about
yeah
yeah
yeah
im still replacing that in the back especially under the trees kind of slow and as you say very expensive
yeah
$unc$uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i caught $unc$wolfe with $unc$one of the sales where they have those big blocks for $unc$fifty cents
and i bought about $unc$twenty of them
yeah
i guess you did too
its what theyve done in the spring or the fall
i put
that was late
that was like
yeah
because i started to say theres different times they say its okay to do it
yeah
that was like $unc$september i think
yeah
and i had to water it
yeah
gosh
keep it damp
my
out here we dont have as many trees in $unc$plano
at least the area where
were over by $unc$collin $unc$creek $unc$mall
but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the $unc$pittosporum all died
and all those variegated things died
so we pretty much go with that dwarf $unc$yaupon and that $unc$yaupon holly
and they just live
yeah
theyre pretty tough
yeah
you can stand those
$unc$pittosporum is kind of borderline here
uh-huh
and usually itll do pretty well
but every once in a while we get $unc$one of these really cold deals
yeah
and it zaps it
its kind of like $unc$one of these
wax leaf ligustrum is the same way
same way
uh-huh
they warned me of that one finally
and i said you need to either read $unc$neal sperrys book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there
and we didnt know the difference
and every year we learn $unc$one more thing that we didnt know before like about these mums
yeah
okay
next year ill do pansies
your list is growing
and my backyard we had it really nice
and then my husband wanted a $unc$labrador puppy
and so it was about
i guess hes $unc$three now
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio
yeah
gee
so its like our backyard is just kind of like
as long as he wont damage it fine
and if theres anything hell hurt we just dont put it out there any more
yeah
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds
yeah
uh-huh
very much
but
i had a small vegetable garden that
you did
it did pretty well
its on the apron of the parkway out behind the garage
uh-huh
and our garages come in from the alley
so do ours
yeah
and its a little piece of land over there
what did you grow
i had tomatoes and peppers
and i had okra
that is amazing
and by the fence i had cucumbers which didnt do real well
yeah
they kind of came out looking like gourds
put them in a salad though
and you say i made it though at least its mine
but i had squash
i had zucchini and yellow crook neck squash
yes
i guess my initial view is our tax burden hasnt gone down in recent years despite tax cuts
uh-huh
but among industrialized nations we have $unc$one of the lowest in the world
and in
of the matter
you get what you pay for
if were going to have national health insurance which seems likely its necessarily going to involve more taxes
i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes thats the direction we should look
right
i guess i kind of have mixed feelings
you always sit there
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it
and you wonder wheres it all going
wheres it all going
and we have such a huge national deficit
and i guess a lot of times theres questions wondering if its doing a whole lot of good
i know theres a lot of social programs out there that need help
but you kind of always wonder wheres the money going
$unc$one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund
uh-huh
but that is a particularly regressive tax
its a tax on the first dollar earnings
and $unc$senator moynihans proposal to cut there i think makes a lot of sense
im sorry
i couldnt
i think $unc$senator moynihans proposal to cut the social security tax which isnt really going to beef up the social security program could make a lot of sense
right
right
yeah
i agree with that
as far as other countries i dont keep up on it too much as far as what theyre do-
i know
we were in $unc$ireland last year
uh-huh
and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here
but as far as other countries im not up to par on
yeah
i think $unc$japan is probably about equal to ours
uh-huh
and other major countries are higher
our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to $unc$canada not so long ago
uh-huh
and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services
and its a real
right
theyre real trade-offs there
right
yeah
and you sit there and wonder
i guess this doesnt really have to do with taxes but just money in general and wondering if youre going to have enough when you retire to live on
i
thats a scary thing that theres no real knowing about
theres a lot of inflation risk that isnt taken care of in most private pension plans
uh-huh
yeah
thats true
but are you involved with the legislature up there
or which
no
im at the $unc$national $unc$institute of $unc$standards and $unc$technology part of the $unc$commerce $unc$department here in $unc$gaithersburg $unc$maryland
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
i was just wondering since you said $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
and you picked this topic
i was just kind of curious
i didnt pick it
you didnt
i dont really recall
i may have filled out on the form
but i certainly have the feeling ive been given topics different from the ones that i mentioned before
did you
i havent placed any calls
did they automatically assign the topic
yes
yes
when you place a call topic is given to you
i didnt know that
i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic
because i havent made any calls yet
ive just received some
you should try it
i didnt realize that
okay
yeah
because it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who youre talking to
many of the subjects are taxes especially
$unc$one thing that has kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the level of the defense budget
exactly
and that same subject
hello
my name is $unc$donna
and im calling from $unc$plano $unc$texas
hi
this is $unc$laurie
and im in $unc$garland
okay
would you like me to go first
sure
okay
i have $unc$three children $unc$two who are in regular school $unc$eleven year old an $unc$eight year old
and then my little one $unc$three year old is in a $unc$university of $unc$gymnastics
its a preschool
uh-huh
and i think it was really hard to pick the right day care or preschool or mothers $unc$day $unc$out
i guess you can classify them all together
uh-huh
some of the qualifications that i look for was the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic in there and what the qualifications of the teachers were and if the place was clean and the hours
uh-huh
and just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
right
we dont have any children
but were going to have $unc$one next year
congratulations
thanks
so thats something that im probably going to be looking at maybe in the future
right
we havent quite decided if im going to
im working part time now
and i dont know if ill be doing that or what were going to do
or staying home
but if we do then im going to need to find somebody
and our church has a mothers $unc$day $unc$out program which they started last year
uh-huh
and we know a lot of people at the church
so i would feel very confident with leaving my child there
thats a very good place to start i think
uh-huh
yeah
the mothers $unc$day $unc$out programs
and thats where $unc$shannon had started in a mothers $unc$day $unc$out program
uh-huh
and the churches always have i think a pretty good program
and you have to make sure that you apply pretty early because a lot of places have very long waiting lists
uh-huh
and another question to ask is if theyre state certified if the teachers have their masters degree in child education and child development
okay
uh-huh
what kind of a structure is it going to be
when your childs a little bit older like a $unc$three year old youd be more concerned with if theres a type of care that its torture for them to lay down and take a nap
uh-huh
is there a mandatory nap time
time uh-huh
what they do at shannons school is have a video tape going
and they lay on these little mats
and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones
and the other ones get up and go do something else
uh-huh
so she doesnt have to necessary take a nap there which is nice
right
uh-huh
its kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately
thats true
and so i guess its such a growing concern
but then theres a lot of good things you dont hear
right
and sometimes when the childs a lot younger before $unc$three years old the church is a good program
and sometimes you even consider having a private person come to your own home when theyre real little or something like that
right
and another consideration is whats the ratio of teachers to children
to children
right
because that makes a difference
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day
just your child or do they just put any child in any crib
uh-huh
you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed
right
right
im sure that whatever you decide youll be happy with
yeah
and its exciting time to have a new one
yeah
were pretty excited
i bet
thats wonderful
yeah
but we have been thinking about that
but its a little ways off in the future
uh-huh
but i figure id probably start asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be before you can bring them in
asking
right
some places take them as infants i guess like $unc$eight weeks even
uh-huh
theres a place to look into
a friend of mine whos a nurse was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place on $unc$fifteenth $unc$street
up
its in $unc$plano somewhere where
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to like $unc$two years old
and its supposed to be really a
some places just specialize in just real little ones
right
and then other ones are the older children
uh-huh
but it is a difficult situation i think
when theyre little its almost easier to leave them because when theyre $unc$three and theyre cry
hi
my name is $unc$donna
and im calling from $unc$plano $unc$texas
im $unc$jay in $unc$dallas
okay
i find exercise kind of a task i guess id say
i go to aerobics $unc$two days a week
but i also have $unc$three kids at home
so they keep me pretty busy
that keeps you plenty of exercise
yeah
that gives me plenty of exercise
but i enjoy walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family
excuse me
thats fine
and yourself
i have
i walked and run almost every morning
ive sort of stopped here with the weather change
but its about a $unc$thirty minute exercise every morning
uh-huh
every morning
my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing
that would
thats fantastic exercise
yeah
he does it every day like a ritual
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if someone invites him to lunch hell not go
but he goes every day
and then hes a runner too
he runs $unc$three mornings a week
he gets up about $unc$five and does his deal
and some days he doesnt
but then maybe hell catch up on the weekend and go for a run
all right
and we
id rather get a bicycle
but i had an exercise bike in the house but didnt seem to use it enough
so somebody sold it in a garage sale
but id like to get a bike and just do biking outside
oh
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here
and i know my husband and i both do it to just keep the pounds off
were getting up in age i guess in our late thirties
so we need to keep exercising just to be able to
yeah
it keeps going
because im fifty-five
and it just gets worse
you still want to eat
but you just
i know
i think you feel better too if you get on some program like that
but
yeah
i go to this aerobics class $unc$two mornings a week
and i take my $unc$three year old with me
theres a nursery there
and its kind of another day out for her to have little friends
uh-huh
and i enjoy the socialization of it
getting to see the same women every morning
right
but there are some parts during that exercise that i think i cannot do another second of this
oh
i know some of it is so tough
it is
and especially when somebodys planning lunch for you and they know whats good for you
i think when we do it ourselves
we take the easy way sometimes
thats true
thats true
so
anyway
okay
thank you for calling
yes
thank you for participating
all right
thank you
bye
bye-bye
guess its logical to ask do you exercise any
unfortunately very little
much less than what i need to
im about the same way
i do a little bit
my job kind of hinders me from exercising
im a night operator here at a industry down here
and i dont really get out a lot to exercise
i am an assistant teacher in business technology
and i think the most exercise ive gotten in the last $unc$three to $unc$four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids questions
it keeps me pretty busy
but its not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going
right
and it really
exercise is so important
it is
and i realize that
thats the way i feel
im used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape played a little basketball and stuff like that
but ive got
now im in college
and i go to school during the day and work at night
i can tell that ive not really done a whole lot
when you exercise what do you do
do you do it at home or a club
or
i usually play at home
we live out in the country
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
or a lot of times were up at the church
well play volleyball
stuff like that
i got a hold of $unc$richard simmons tape
really
what is it
i cant even think of the name of it right offhand with the oldies
the sweating to the oldies
$unc$sweating to the $unc$oldies
yeah
and thats not bad
really
thats pretty upbeat
so every once in a while ill put the cassette in and go with it
right
not often enough to have a routine
right
ill
my little $unc$schnauzer wishes i would get out and walk with her
really
but i dont know
by the time i get home all i want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer
and my fingers exercise more than anything now
right
thats the way i am
i just want to sit down and relax
too tired to exercise i did
yes
do you ever ride a bike or anything like that
i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago
and id ride about $unc$two or $unc$three miles a day
but it would last about a couple of weeks
and it got real cold for a little while
so i gave it up
here about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk
walk around
because theyre enclosed
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
right
right
ive noticed people doing that down here too
ill be in town or something
and people will walk around the mall
and its safe
it is fairly safe
thats inside the mall
may be not safe going to the parking garage
yeah
certain parts of it
i know a doctor once told me it
a friend of mine suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
right
right
i used to do a lot of swimming
we have a swimming pool
but its an old concrete pool
weve been having trouble with it the past few years
so we havent got to use it much
but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
the swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
and the water takes the resistance
right
right
and you dont get the soreness
ive done some water exercises
but our pool is not heated
so its
right
you cant do it year round
summertime only
right
thats the way ours is
you dont when its $unc$twenty some odd degrees go out to the swimming pool
no
its too cold
hot tubs are not too bad
but
i could deal with a hot tub
those are nice
what part of $unc$mississippi are you from
im from $unc$laurel
whereabouts is that
thats way down towards the south
not quite on the coast
but were about $unc$two hours from the coast
oh
and you do have cold weather down there
yes maam
it started about yesterday i believe
it started raining and got real cold
ours started $unc$thanksgiving
oh
and from there just
today was pretty
but $unc$sunday the snow and ice came in
right
and there was no exercise
they tell you what our topic was
i think golf isnt it
right
how much of a golfer are you
are you a hacker
you bet
im $unc$fifty years old
ive been a hacker
i think i played better golf when i was $unc$fifteen $unc$john than i play right now
i know i did
i know i did
and
course i know i watch my $unc$thirteen year old play now
and its like they dont have a muscle in their body
i know
its just unreal
im a guy that plays
if i play a lot of golf i play $unc$six to $unc$eight times a year
and thats about it
i figure thats my retirement game
i really
i come from a family of golfers
uh-huh
i was raised by a man my stepfather who with a $unc$two handicap he could get down on his knees and hit the ball further than most people could hit it
sure
my stepfather is dead but my mother who is now $unc$seventy-one i can remember her being i believe a $unc$sixteen or a $unc$fourteen handicap
but all they did every day in their life was to play golf every
theyd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in $unc$richmond $unc$virginia and just play $unc$nine holes of golf
yeah
that was their deal
they
thats what it takes
you need to play that often to get a really good handicap
but i just never could do it
i have a brother-in-law who is an ex-college coach and like a pro
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family
i went to
i decided this past year that i was going to get out and start playing a lot more
and i went after it
and and i really didnt find much improvement
fact ever time id start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would go back up
really
yeah
i think i need to
yeah
i probably need to take some more lessons and practice more often
yeah
spend more time on the
i think im probably the same way
lessons do help
i know ever year we buy
i go to this $unc$ducks $unc$unlimited dinner
its a hunters type affair
uh-huh
and i buy in $unc$austin $unc$texas
i go down to $unc$austin
i live in the $unc$dallas area but i go down to $unc$austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine
uh-huh
and we always buy this weekend at a country club in the hill country at $unc$horseshoe $unc$bay
yeah
yeah
im familiar with it
and we just have a ball
and we play $unc$three days in a row $unc$three different courses
and course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the third course my score has gone from a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty down to about a $unc$hundred and $unc$five
so
yeah
if you play regular i think it makes a big difference
you bet
so that makes a lot of difference to me
yeah
yeah
ive also found too i try to work out regularly
and when i am doing that and feeling loose that i swing better
i get through the ball better
and i also if i
i found as ive gotten a little older here i worry less about my distance
you bet
and i
my control is a little bit better there
yeah
so
thats super
i havent learned to hit the ball easy
and i just sort of
im always wanting to hit it hard
and thats something my stepfather never could teach me just to relax and hit the ball
and subsequently when i do tire out from playing like $unc$twelve $unc$fourteen holes a lot of my energys gone
when i do swing its an easier swing
uh-huh
and i do actually hit the ball better
uh-huh
have you ever tried a $unc$one iron
no
i have a $unc$two through wedge
i hit a $unc$two iron awful lot
off the tee
uh-huh
i dont hit a driver off the tee
thats why i need my driving lessons
i put mine back in my bag this year too
and i used a $unc$three wood rather than a driver
that helps
i had a lot more control on it
i sacrificed distance
but i wasnt in trouble every time i got down the fairway
thats a good idea
i think this next year im going to attempt to play more
and im going to do the same thing
i laid off my woods about $unc$three years ago
and i just use a $unc$two wood off the fairway
and im a fairly strong person
so i get a pretty good little drive
uh-huh
and and i guess control my irons better
if youll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
yeah
absolutely
and i still remember that watching myself and my son
but i think the key is you need to play more often than i play
yeah
i read recently here if youre scoring well you should play more
if youre scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice range
right
i think there is less frustration factor there too
makes good sense
but i
the $unc$one iron is something ive been thinking because my drivers gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start
apparently theyre very difficult to play with
but with practice i would imagine you could groove that swing too
and i play with a fellow that can knock a $unc$one iron
its incredible
yeah
and his accuracy is whats so startling with it
and i
but its an iron that hes really practiced with
he has used a lot
and it would be fun to get that good with distance iron
you bet
my challenge of the game is just if i can get off the first tee when everyones standing around watching you id be great after that
that boy
i just
if i get off the tee box and ive anything from a $unc$hundred $unc$fifty to $unc$two $unc$hundred yard drive through a straight i just want to get down and kiss the ground
and get away without embarrassing yourself
right
because
okay
do you exercise regularly
there is
i am a school teacher
uh-huh
and us
there is girl that went through our school district i teach in $unc$highland $unc$park who does aerobics at the $unc$y $unc$w $unc$c $unc$a
uh-huh
uh-huh
turn that off please
i am recording
my husband just turned on something noisy
uh-huh
any way she comes to the school
and there are a group of teachers
and we exercise regularly for an hour
uh-huh
and we do it twice a week
that is good
and we do aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for $unc$thirty minutes
and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another $unc$thirty minutes
uh-huh
so it is an hour
and then my husband and i take $unc$ten mile walks as often as possible
uh-huh
and not on the nights that i do aerobics
but if he wants to he jogs
but we take the fast walks
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
uh-huh
and so we take it seriously
we enjoy doing it
i enjoy my group at school
it is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself
yeah
uh-huh
i use to exercise regularly
and i havent lately
i have goofed off i guess
i use to also take an aerobics class about $unc$three days a week before work
uh-huh
but i guess my job change my husbands job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
i understand that
so
i have never been able to do it before
the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day
i just want to go home and not do anything
and too i just make myself
yeah
i get up at $unc$five $unc$thirty
and i am at school at $unc$seven $unc$thirty
oh
school is not over until $unc$four
uh-huh
and our class
but it is in the building
oh
that is the big difference
because there are other people around that
you had better hurry
go get dressed
there is motivation around there
and then we can change right there in the building
i dont have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
uh-huh
and i just go
and we exercise
and until then i have belonged to exercise clubs
and i have gone to these gyms like in $unc$plano and $unc$richardson rec centers really where they offer aerobics
uh-huh
and i have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner
yeah
and you are just kind of going ugh
and i have tried it immediately after school
try to get some place and exercise from $unc$five to $unc$six
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late
that is right
that is right
that is a
it is
it is really hard with our life style when you work to
uh-huh
i know some people go during lunch
but by the time i get over the gym and go for my class and shower and get back to work it is probably $unc$two hours or more
uh-huh
and that is just too long
i have twenty-five minutes for lunch
yeah
that is out for me
that doesnt really do it does it
no
i dont think so
yeah
and they are nice because if we are running late it usually
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us
cause they know we are in the building and coming where as at another place you are paying a lot more money
yeah
and it does going to start whether you are there or not
that is right
that is right
so this has worked out real nicely
in fact she charges us $unc$two dollars a session
that is not much
huh-uh
so its
we pay her for $unc$six weeks at a time cause that is a unit in school report card period
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so it is like $unc$twenty-four dollars every $unc$six weeks
oh
that is not bad
huh-uh
it beats memberships at some of these clubs
that is for sure
you are not kidding
they are real expensive
i know
we belonged for a period of time to the $unc$signature $unc$club for about a year
uh-huh
we were paying a $unc$hundred dollars plus month for our family membership
oh
and at first we used it
and then it got where we werent beginning to get out moneys worth
yeah
and they offered lots of things
but we werent taking advantage of them because we didnt have the time to
yeah
so we decided to forget that
uh-huh
that was just a waste of our money
yeah
yeah
we have $unc$one through work
no
but i dont know
i still just dont end up going cause it isnt at a convenient time or i dont know something
but i need to do something
if its only walk the dog or something
uh-huh
i need to start doing that
it does make you feel better
the hard thing is getting going
that is right
and if you have somebody who will do it with you
for a long time my husband didnt want to walk cause he wants to jog
uh-huh
but he decided that maybe
what are you guys having for $unc$christmas
what are we having
lets see
im not planning the menu
youre not
no
we usually go out to either one of our folks
they both live close to
yeah
but i dont know
it seems like a big thing for $unc$christmas is usually ham
funny you should mention that
im a pig farmer
you are
yeah
its kind of a hobby more than anything else
but were going to have wild boar
my goodness
we killed a boar the other day
it was mating with the sows
and you cant use the piglets
so
its about $unc$six months of no use
so we shot him and cleaned him out and had him processed into ham
and were also going to have a little roast suckling pig because ive got $unc$one thats got a hernia
really
and rather than pay the vet $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars for surgery well just cook him and eat him
is that hard
no
i tell you what preparing a little pig is a snap
im telling you real easy easier than chicken
really
yeah
you just
you kill him
you probably
most guys just shoot them in the head
they go
in a second theyre gone
oh
and then you just dip the carcass in boiling water pull it out and we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and gut it and just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and some pineapple about $unc$three pineapples sliced them up and cover him up with wet sacks feed sacks is what i usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
huh
my goodness
and after about $unc$six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there
and its the best eating you ever had
does a boar taste just like regular ham
yep
just like a pig
does it
it has a lot less fat
this wild boar weighed probably about $unc$three $unc$hundred and $unc$thirty pounds
oh my
and he dressed out to almost $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$ten pounds
my goodness
we took the skin and the head and the feet off
and that was about a $unc$hundred pounds of just ham
how many people are you planning on serving at $unc$christmas
were not going to eat the whole thing
eat it all
yeah
it would take a year
but were going to drive up to $unc$kansas $unc$city see my wifes folks
and she
whats your mother cooking for $unc$christmas
yeah
her moms doing brisket
i dont
what is brisket
brisket
its a part of the cow that they used to throw away
its just tough as a boot
oh
and they used to use it for leather i think
my goodness
no
i was kidding
yeah
but its a part of the loin the rib cage
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs
so its really a tough piece of meat
my goodness
but its so tasty you cant stand it
so you just take it
and you marinate it for a couple of days
and that softens it up huh
and then you just put it in the oven
takes about $unc$four hours to cook one
they weigh about anywhere from $unc$ten to $unc$twenty pounds
gee
and were going to have that
what else do you serve with your pig
well have cranberries and hominy
and were big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here
we have black olives and cucumbers and tomatoes
we still have tomatoes
do you
yeah
fresh tomatoes
we just got lots of snow
it started to freeze up around here
theres nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of thats down
its $unc$thirty degrees this morning
really
yeah
but itll go up to $unc$fifty or $unc$sixty almost
my goodness
i didnt know it got that low at night
yeah
its desert
where we are its the edge of the desert
its part of the $unc$great $unc$plains
so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a $unc$hundred $unc$hundred and $unc$ten
gee
and at night it goes down to about $unc$sixty
my goodness
yeah
we get a $unc$fifty degree temperature swing in about $unc$four hours
boy
so everything that lives around here is real tough
thats trees
we got $unc$hundred year old trees that are $unc$twenty feet tall
gee
thats all the bigger they get
theyre just hard as a rock
what
how do you get your main source of current events
until recently i was taking the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal
and i thought that was a good way
but i have about $unc$five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things
its a week or $unc$two late
but thats how im staying up
i either watch the news
or occasionally ill read the paper
do you like how its presented on the news
no
i think the medias a little bit too manipulative
they allow you
they try to lead you too much i believe
and sometimes theyre not very open
i dont know
i think theyre a little bit biased sometimes
like for example the $unc$kennedy rape case
the coverage on that was
when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty
they try to have you form opinions or whatever
and then i didnt like the things that were going on when we had $unc$desert $unc$storm and stuff like that
basically i think they dont present the whole sides of everything
so it makes you feel like theyre wanting you to take their opinion
right
its more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues
yeah
ive noticed that too
and its kind of distressing isnt it
yeah
and ive noticed that they do it just with subtle little words usually just that sway the whole report by just a couple of words
when i was in school i was a communications major
so im well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and so forth
so communications
were you looking into becoming a reporter
or
i was
and i ventured off in a whole entire different field
i went with the state
uh-huh
and i went with the $unc$department of $unc$state $unc$treasurer in retirement disability
calculate benefits
i bet thats a interesting job
yeah
so the
and working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself
so thats another source where i keep up with current events
and
yeah
theres one that im reading right now
its $unc$information $unc$week
it says $unc$a $unc$t and $unc$t to account for the benefits that the $unc$a $unc$i $unc$c $unc$p $unc$a now says you have to show as a liability
its going to cost them $unc$seven point $unc$five $unc$billion after tax charge in $unc$ninety-three to account for that
its a lot of money
and itll drop their earnings by a $unc$hundred $unc$million a year forever more
its a lot of money
yeah
it is
and you have to stay up on stuff
and i bet in your job that you have to
do you read the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal
no
no
i primarily deal with the state employees
but i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the state of $unc$north carolinas budget and stuff like that
and i really know what the budget is
and when they were saying we were so poor and they couldnt pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that
and im well aware of the billions of assets that the state has
and its just funny
so thats
so i dont have a whole lot of faith in the news
course its
they get what they hear from
but its not always i think $unc$one $unc$hundred percent reliable
can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective
i think they need to go into a little bit more depth before they would just report somebody wants to make a statement or something like that
because another example is the aids issue or whatever
someone said i found a cure
they immediately
the headlines on the news or whatever is someone says they found a cure for aids
and then $unc$two months later its discovered its not
before they come out with something like that they need to research the matter i believe a little bit more
i guess they do that so they dont get scooped
so they have the big story
that
yeah
i
it
i think the
lets see
my husband does the majority of the gardening taking care of the lawn and fertilizing
but i tend to all the planting the annuals and the spraying and taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and any kind of decorating for the holidays
uh-huh
ill fix the porch up with pumpkins for $unc$halloween and $unc$christmas
but basically he does all the heavy stuff
and i do all the fun stuff
we have it just opposite here
my wife works at the $unc$t $unc$i
and shes sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow
uh-huh
i see
and we have about $unc$ten acres
and she tries to mow about half of it
wow
wow thats a big job
yeah
it keeps
its doing real well
because when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed
uh-huh
it was bare dirt in a lot of places
uh-huh
and now since weve been mowing it
and of course we water a little bit
thats just too much to water all at once
but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in weve reclaimed a lot of it
sure
i bet its beautiful
yeah
but we dont do much in the way of flowers
we have $unc$one little flower garden that we work with
uh-huh
the rest of it is just wild flowers
wild flowers
and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
uh-huh
theyre about i guess a third the size of palm of your hand
uh-huh
and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush
that sounds lovely
uh-huh
the wild flowers are beautiful
i was thinking about throwing some in the back just way in the back behind the swing sets
or just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty
then you dont really have to have much maintenance involved
yeah
my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing
uh-huh
she enjoys mowing
i cant believe it
uh-huh
i know a lot of
i hate it
uh-huh
a lot of women do
ive just never really
maybe $unc$one of these days ill have to get out there and mow
but my husband takes it on
and ill help rake up the grass
and sometimes ill help him edge
because we dont have that much property
but were on a corner lot
so theres a lot of edging to do
right
and thats whats nice about living more in the country
you dont have to worry about any of that
we dont even have any concrete or asphalt
oh
thats nice
i
this is different for us because the other
in the past weve had homes that havent had any side walks
and its been a little more country with the trees
and we do miss that
if we had a chance to move i think wed move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as far as that goes
uh-huh
yeah
but we do everything together
uh-huh
this spring we got a $unc$thousand pine trees from the
actually this fall i was talking about
$unc$two weeks ago we got a $unc$thousand pine trees from the soil and conservation people
oh
uh-huh
and were in the process of planting
wow thats
and were building a stand just to the north of our house and along the east property line
and i think what were trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like youre not even there
uh-huh
right
so
right
i put
on the other side of the house though thats where we have all the delicate flowers and the mums
and we have morning glory
uh-huh
and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers
and we planted those out by the septic so that they get plenty of water
uh-huh
and we get hummingbirds come in the spring all summer long
oh
that sounds so pretty
and when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
really
they dont do any damage though
they just fly right back out if you have the
yeah
they dont like it in here because theres nothing to eat
i see
and when youre as busy as $unc$one of those babies youve got to eat most of the time
i see
and we got a few
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders
uh-huh
but for the most part gardening for us is
we got asparagus
and weve got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries
uh-huh
man we get the best strawberries that you just cant believe
that sounds wonderful
we just got our last tomatoes
i love home grown tomatos
yeah
theres nothing like them
they just dont have the same ones in the supermarket
these are accidental tomatos
what does that mean accidental tomatoes
last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes
of course youre going to lose some that way
uh-huh
and the seeds go right through them
i see
and wherever they pooped
what are your favorite shows
its doesnt seem like i get enough time to watch much t v
but the ones that are out now
uh-huh
ive watched that sisters a couple of times
i think thats kind of a good show
ive never seen that
havent you
huh-uh
i like that one
and im trying to think
i dont even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch
how about you
i like $unc$l $unc$a law not because its realistic but its entertaining
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do like that
yeah
occasionally ill see that one
lets see
i watch $unc$cheers sometimes and mostly just movies when theres a good movie on
do you
uh-huh
when there isnt a good movie on too
oh
i just like to have the t v on if im home alone or something
uh-huh
have
either the radio or the t v got to be on the whole time
yeah
i do
i kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately
really
ive been home with a
i have a baby
and so ive havent seemed to have gotten out as much
uh-huh
so ill watch a soap occasionally
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you watch any of those
i dont because i work all day
uh-huh
but i pro-
i usually do if im home for a couple of days around $unc$christmas or whatever
after a while ill start watching it
uh-huh
and then on
for a while ill ask people if they know what happened
oh
and then ill just forget it
what ones do you get into
i dont even remember
the last time i watched was back in college
it was $unc$general $unc$hospital or something
uh-huh
and i maybe watched it for a week
oh
but i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the
they wouldnt take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera
how funny
yeah
it was a
i dont get into them that much
when im home sometimes in the day ill watch them
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i was really trying to think
i dont even know if theres any other shows that i watch or else
you said you have kids
how old
i have a $unc$six year old
and i have a
hell be a year old in $unc$january
so you arent a $unc$sesame $unc$street fan
they watch it
my $unc$six year olds kind of
hes outgrown that $unc$one a little bit
but ive started to turn it on a little bit for the baby
uh-huh
and hes entertained by it
uh-huh
so yes
i do watch that $unc$one
supposed to be a great babysitter
yeah
theyre not entertained for too long with it
hes still too little
but yeah
yeah
i do turn that on
and i do like $unc$donahue
uh-huh
sometimes i watch that
i think he has some interesting things on it
i know
what time is that on
i never see it
lets see its on at $unc$four
okay
im not home then
thats why i dont see it
yeah
ill watch that occasionally
hes got some real
i dont know
theres some real weird people that he seems to come up with
isnt it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange
yes
yeah
yeah
he does have some real bizarre things i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
so other than that i dont know
whats that
guess im not much of a t v person really
yeah
i guess it wasnt a real good topic for us
but tell me
is it snowing up there
no
no
it snowed a little bit probably about $unc$four days ago
uh-huh
and they said we werent going to get any more for $unc$christmas
yeah
oh
there is snow on the ground
thats nice
i wish it would snow a little bit more
ive heard its raining there
gosh
weve broken all sorts of records
really
theyve got
we still have some highways closed
and it stopped raining almost $unc$twenty-four hours ago
my goodness
but just phenomenal
i
you see it on the news all the time
but until youve really seen it it doesnt really hit you
yeah
but i was driving home from work $unc$friday
and i saw there were some stop signs submerged up to the writing on the stop sign
and that was just
goodness
it was amazing to me
gee
so there has been some flooding
and
theres been a lot
yeah
its too bad
but the thing is that this happens
in the last $unc$three years its happened at least once a year if not twice but the people continue to move back in the flood zones
uh-huh
gee
so i dont know
you got to wonder how long theyre going to keep doing that for
yeah
i dont think i would
boy
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
yeah
what a mess
yeah
do you work for $unc$t $unc$i
yeah
i do
yeah
uh-huh
this has been an interesting thing to do
have you made a lot of calls
or
ive probably talked maybe to $unc$five people
uh-huh
my husband is doing it too
and hes talked to a few more than me
oh
but its been real interesting and kind of fun
do you get paid for these
$unc$five dollars
$unc$five dollars a call
uh-huh
gosh
i wish i could do that
dont you have to do it as part of its
we cant get paid for it
dont you have to do it
what vacations have you been on that you like
i really enjoyed
i went to $unc$mackinaw $unc$island a few years back
right
its in the middle of $unc$michigan
so that was nice
uh-huh
i like driving to different cities because of the scenery
so that was nice
so you
most of yours is kind of driving
and
yeah
ive been all over the states except for pretty much east
its very pretty driving up north in $unc$wisconsin too
how far do you usually end up driving youre from where $unc$wisconsin
the furthest i drove was probably $unc$texas
and then ive taken a train before to $unc$california
$unc$kenosha $unc$wisconsin
uh-huh
okay
yeah
i have a brother in $unc$minnesota that used to live in $unc$wisconsin
oh
so yeah
thats quite a ways
yeah
it is
ive
we went to $unc$california this last year and liked it
uh-huh
but it was too crowded
$unc$walt $unc$disney $unc$world and other places its just the wrong time of the year to go
yeah
and course you get in any of those tourist traps and everythings outrageously priced
uh-huh
and kind of
you wonder if its really worth it to pay $unc$thirty-five dollars or $unc$forty dollars just to get in
yeah
but theres lots of fun places to see
thats true
i think the scenery kind of
thats something do to to get up in mountains
or
yeah
uh-huh
do you have any mountains nearby
no
pretty flat isnt it
yeah
yeah
i think the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isnt it
yeah
yeah
what vacation have you enjoyed the most
probably when we go to $unc$wisconsin
its pretty fun
theres a lot to do up there
its pretty busy though
you have to like crowds
what is it
its a huge amusement park they have water slides
okay
uh-huh
and its just a big big tourist attraction
the downtown is all little shops and candy shops
and its really neat
i dont think hardly anybody lives there
because its just kind of tourists
probably a city in itself kind of like huh
yeah
its mostly a summer place
summer place
how far away is it
from $unc$kenosha its about $unc$three hours
its about a hour away from $unc$madison
okay
sure
yeah
so thats nice
sure
its a pretty ride up there too
i really like the city $unc$wausau in $unc$wisconsin
its really pretty
its nice out there
i like all the nature things there are to look at
right
and you can probably
youre in a climate thats kind of humid
so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things
our climates real dry
where is that
and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery
most of the lands pretty brown
you dont have as much of the greenery like you have
oh
wheres that
$unc$idaho is where i live
and
yes
okay
its by
i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that im on the phone
its by $unc$boise
you ever heard of $unc$boise
yeah
yeah
and its fine
its nice
its lot different kind of
i lived in $unc$indiana for a while
and its a real different land and scenery than there
its kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that
yeah
i think theres a lot of places down even in southern $unc$utah the canyon lands and $unc$bryce $unc$canyon
and boy theyre gorgeous
yeah
those are kind of fun places
we usually go over to $unc$bear $unc$lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of $unc$idaho and $unc$utah
and the lake goes on forever
and thats real pretty over there too
oh
but i think im kind of a summer vacationer
yeah
me too
me too
unless im going somewhere warm for the winter
right
right
yeah
thatd be nice
whered you
are you presently looking for a used car
as a matter of fact i just bought $unc$one
just bought $unc$one
just within the last $unc$three weeks
s-
what did you get
i got a $unc$lexus $unc$l $unc$s $unc$four $unc$hundred which is made by $unc$toyota
lexus
okay
$unc$lexus is a toyota subbrand
yeah
okay
its kind of their
i was wondering where that came from
because theyre talking like it was an american built car
right
it sounds like it but it really isnt
yeah
its marketed of course its own dealerships
yeah
usually or somebody thats maybe got a $unc$cadillac or $unc$lincoln and $unc$lexus dealership
yeah
sometimes they do that
but its a brand car
yeah
but ive really liked it
it drives just wonderfully
and there is
its so quiet almost cant tell the engine is running
thats their big selling point other than general luxury
but the particular seems to be the quiet ride
it really is
its got pretty good acceleration too
yeah
its got a $unc$c $unc$d player in it
so i can play those
and
was
that wasnt a standard feature was it
uh-huh
okay
but there is not very many options on that car
there is only about $unc$five or $unc$six options
everything else is standard
yeah
you get the impression that
some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the $unc$c $unc$d and the premium sound system
uh-huh
skidding control
you mean the antilock brake system
yeah
its kind of a traction control i think they call it
yeah
its not just antilock brake
i think thats already on most of them
but there is a further traction control
oh
this is probably suspension tied into the brakes
yeah
and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow
it can raise the cars center up a little bit for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in $unc$michigan or somewhere
yeah
yeah
shoot
$unc$mississippi probably doesnt have to worry too much
some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
no
snow doesnt happen very often
if it does people go whats this stuff
yeah
originally im from $unc$west $unc$virginia
we got a pretty fair amount of snow
oh
you had some there
yeah
but i got down here in $unc$june of $unc$eighty-four
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter theyd seen in $unc$twenty years
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
i know
we had this group of surveyors come into a shop i was working in $unc$four or $unc$five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked
but while they were there they set back drank about $unc$four or $unc$five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place had themselves a ball for about an hour
no
the $unc$lexus really
and the moon roof i think is also an option
yeah
although most of them are ordered them with it
but there really is only about a half a dozen things
and everything else is pretty standard
yeah
i did not get the traction control which when you take the traction control and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too
oh
so thats kind of
you go out and get in that real cold car
its a package deal
and you turn that on
and it kind of
but thats only available with the traction control and the other option
yeah
and those $unc$two are sold together
so you have to take a $unc$two $unc$thousand dollar option there to do it
ouch
so i opted not for that
and the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the moon roof and nice floor mats and everything in there
no
it doesnt sound real necessary in $unc$texas
yeah
yeah
i worked for $unc$lincoln
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a $unc$c $unc$d or not in the stereo system
and that was pretty much it
and they had $unc$three or $unc$four basic packages that they offer
yeah
sounds like the $unc$lincoln $unc$mercury dealer i used to work for
they didnt order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got
little $unc$mercury $unc$tracer
yeah
ive been o-
ive been
imagine or not they make a luxury $unc$mercury $unc$tracer
yeah
ive seen that in the dealership
i was driving a $unc$lincoln a $unc$mark $unc$seven for the last $unc$four years before i traded it for this
yeah
and im leasing the $unc$lexus
i usually lease them since i own a business
yeah
i just run it through my business
but it
uh-huh
the $unc$lincoln ride is certainly good too but this $unc$lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before
its just
like sitting in your living room
yeah
it really is
and its got a lumbar support in the seats
adjustable
adjustable power
yeah
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma-
tell me what you think about the $unc$vietnam war
okay
im a $unc$vietnam era veteran
and i was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater
however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation
im of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored
however i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker
but those are my personal thoughts
and i think that if wed let the generals run the war like we let the generals run $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two wed had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
but as it was the politicians ran the $unc$korean conflict and ultimately the $unc$vietnam thing
and we managed to come out losers all the way around
and so this is what ultimately triggered us $unc$united $unc$states per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman
your views
as i understand it and i dont know a lot about it we got in there because of $unc$france
$unc$france was there first
they had
we got into it because of $unc$seato agreement back just right after $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two that we pledged a mutual defense of the $unc$south $unc$vietnamese
and as it turned out they were in a civil war $unc$one with another
and really we
i question us now
of course hindsight is all too clear
sure
so we have to deal with the situation as we played it
$unc$jerry what did you think of people like $unc$jane $unc$fonda another anti-war activist
i
dont get me started on those people
before $unc$jane $unc$fonda did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person
but after
i just dont want anything to do with her any more
because you support your government
right or wrong
okay
right or wrong
i dont think we can determine whether we were right or wrong
because youre having to deal with again
i think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there
uh-huh
i didnt realize that wed signed some type of deal like that
i thought we came in as first advisors to the $unc$french and then they decided to pull out
and
can you hold just a second $unc$terry
sure
$unc$one moment please
sure
wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something
fascinating
well thats not
sorry for the delay
thats okay
yeah
this is
the mutual defense thing was
we
it was complicated
and i dont think everybody knows the whole situation
i dont
but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the $unc$south $unc$vietnamese should they ask
the $unc$french went in and tried their old style warfare and got soundly thrashed
and we didnt do a whole lot better
no
had thought that they had colonies there or something
yeah
that was the old $unc$french colony but see the $unc$french were our allies in $unc$nato
right
and theyre also our allies in $unc$seato which was the $unc$southeast $unc$asia $unc$treaty $unc$organization which has since been disbanded as far as i know
$unc$nato is on the way of being disbanded
but the $unc$french
we go in as an ally to the $unc$french and says yeah well help you out if you get in a bind
they got in a bind and says we dont want to play any more
uh-huh
so we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly operations and then the full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
yeah
im thirty-two
so i bar-
i missed it
seventy-four is when they quit sending troops
yeah
yeah
roughly
yeah
i was just probably $unc$three or $unc$four years
okay
what kind of hobbies do you have $unc$lori
i guess i like to play golf
uh-huh
and i also like to plant flowers and do some gardening and do arts and crafts
uh-huh
where do you play golf in this area
we live pretty close to the $unc$mesquite golf course
uh-huh
we will play either out there or at $unc$firewheel
that is usually where we play
but i have played different courses in the $unc$dallas area
do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf
both
oh
not at the same time
i was going to say that could be difficult
sometimes we ride
and sometimes we pull
we like to a lot of the times just walk for the exercise
but
uh-huh
i find that when i ride in a cart i play better
and i think it is cause i dont get as tired
i think that might be true
yeah
i dont like pulling a cart on firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path
i know
and that makes me so mad
it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
that is the reason i dont play over there
yeah
i like the course but i dont play over there because they dont allow you to pull a cart
right
and i dont think a cart damages the turf
right
the reason why we play over there is because since we are a $unc$garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get $unc$ten rounds of golf for a $unc$hundred dollars
yeah
a $unc$hundred dollars
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are
uh-huh
so that is why we play over there
cause we have got our card
i guess i could use a card too
i live very close to the $unc$firewheel golf course
do you
so you live in $unc$garland then
yes
i live in northwest $unc$garland
right up there near the golf course
okay
we are in south $unc$garland
but next time you go check into it
they have
it is just like a bus card
and they just punch it
it has got $unc$one through $unc$ten on it
and every time you go they just punch it for you
in the last $unc$two years i have not played very much golf because i am involved in $unc$boy $unc$scouts
okay
so i have children $unc$boy $unc$scout age
you must have a son
i have $unc$two boys that are boy scout age
and so i am very active in $unc$boy $unc$scouts
okay
so i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and $unc$boy $unc$scouts is my hobby
yeah
but i
that sounds like fun too
but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again
because my boys are still right at the beginning age
and it is probably going to be $unc$six to $unc$eight years before they go to college
uh-huh
you need to teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
thats right
lessons are expensive though
yeah
well you can teach them
they would probably never make it then
because i dont think
i only took lessons for golf when i was in college
uh-huh
as a course for $unc$p $unc$e you know so i could graduate
right
right
uh-huh
but that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons
and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
uh-huh
right
right
i took $unc$one lesson $unc$one other time
besides that i just try to make the club hit the ball
right
yeah
i know what you mean
i dont want to play strike out
uh-huh
but i have fun doing it
i have some good shots and some bad shots
yeah
it is just nice to get outdoors and do something
so you said you work in the gardens too
do you have special flowers
flower gardens
i like to have
matter of fact this past weekend i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs
so those ought to be coming up around spring time
my wife had just put in a bunch of i want to say they are pansies
uh-huh
she put them in like $unc$two months ago cause they are winter plants
right
and they have been
we thought even with all the cold weather we have had they have been blooming just fine
they do great
i put mine in probably in $unc$november
that is when she did i think
yeah
i think it was $unc$november
and i dont do anything to mine water them or anything
and they just
they do really good
and i guess it was last year or the year before i had some out
and it froze
and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later
i didnt do anything to them
so they are good to plant in the winter time
they last for a long time then
so you can put them out in the spring too
but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they cant stand the hot weather
uh-huh
do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time
will they make it through the summer sun
no
they wont make it through the summer because it gets too hot
but they make it through probably winter and spring
so
yeah
i have got some of those too
cause i love flowers
that is good
yeah
and i try to do some arts and crafts
and i love to go
so you have a $unc$two years old in child care right now uh-huh
yeah
we
$unc$two year old daughter in child care
and we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be real good child care at a pretty reasonable price we think
how about you
do you have any children
yes
our first
and he just turned $unc$three months
boy
so were just starting into hunting for child care
yeah
right now both of us are students
are you
where are a student
$unc$university of $unc$southern $unc$mississippi
no kidding
shes
i was a professor in a university here in $unc$california for a while
yeah
yeah
are you going to put your son in child care in a year or $unc$two
probably
spring semester a year from now hes going to have to be in child care $unc$five days a week more than likely depending on how my class schedule runs
yeah
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester
uh-huh
it will be $unc$forty hour week no $unc$eight to $unc$five type of thing
yeah
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend anywhere from $unc$four to $unc$eight hours a day in child care at that point
right now were trying to avoid it
but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him
i get out of class at certain time
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class
once a day this overlap happens where we cant one of us be home
yeah
yeah
so for about $unc$twenty $unc$thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in
thats a good experience i think
and there are a lot of things to think about
and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good
and they kind of boil down to
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
uh-huh
and what we found to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
yeah
and thats more important than anything else
we could have sent her to a fancier facility
uh-huh
she goes to a home
this is a couple emigrated from $unc$china early in their lives
uh-huh
theyve been here probably $unc$thirty $unc$forty years
yeah
theyve got $unc$three daughters
and they have a loving home
and theyre both there
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
uh-huh
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
yeah
so its a good experience
that makes a big difference
if its good i think its very good for the child
yes
and if its a loving environment i think its very good
and and thats really what weve learned about it
shell have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
yeah
but we feel real fortunate
and we were able to just choose in the marketplace
i dont know what its like around $unc$hattiesburg
theres a lot of child care available but invariably theres waiting lists
uh-huh
yeah
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the their $unc$home $unc$ec $unc$department
yeah
ill bet theyre involved
yeah
they have a subbranch $unc$american $unc$family $unc$counseling
and their people staff the child care center just off campus
but they have a pretty good size waiting list
yeah
so
thats
i know its a real hard thing to do even for people in university communities
uh-huh
out here at $unc$manford they have a real good facility
and there is quite a waiting list to get into that
yeah
so its an important decision
its an industry thats still a cottage industry
yeah yeah
and i think this is buyer beware it is the best way to do it interestingly
a cottage industrys the best way to do it really
because if you over
i think that my own interest in human development leads me to believe that thats a good sign and that private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
because i think what were going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market
as a matter of fact my future is banked on that professionally because i believe that there are pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching $unc$sesame $unc$street and in child care
uh-huh
primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
yes
and its amazing how much good things like $unc$sesame $unc$street will do
its phenomenal
its phenomenal the human operating system
favorite type of music or musician or any
i dont really have a favorite type
i like a lot of different types of music
do you
yeah
i have a tape collection that i like to listen to cassette tapes
uh-huh
but its pretty varied
uh-huh
yeah
how about you
im very varied as well
i dont think ive ever met a type of music i dont like except for maybe heavy metal and that
thats exactly me
the acid rock or the heavy metal
yeah
even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule
yeah
i dont care for that at all
yeah
i dont enjoy rap too much either
that doesnt appeal to my ears
as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i like some of their songs
oh
but as
i agree with the general rule i wouldnt choose rap either
uh-huh
but i like to listen to what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz classical
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont
i like like i said pretty varied music
uh-huh
i have a couple that my husband really hates that i listen to like $unc$billy $unc$holiday
oh
i really love to listen to her
uh-huh
and i even have a tape of $unc$lady $unc$smith blackman bazo
gosh
and theyre very harmonic
uh-huh
they really are
uh-huh
yeah
sure
so theyre interesting to listen to
you might try that
how about you
i listen to specific
most likely i would be listen to jazz or classical music
in college i took $unc$four years of classical guitar
and i played in the jazz combo all $unc$four years
i play guitar for the jazz combo
yeah
so thats where my $unc$two listening enjoyments are
but jazz can get on my nerves after a while
you cant just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff unless youre playing it
its too
you have to concentrate on it it seems
it just doesnt do anything
what about the blues or something like that
blues are okay
i tell you i do like
i grew up on blue grass music
my dad is a big blue grass fan
and so
uh-huh
i wouldnt have admitted it when i was in high school
but i really do like it a lot
so
i like some of it
as far as what they now call country western it doesnt sound like the old country music at all does it
no
it doesnt
it doesnt
some of it sounds more like pop music
yeah
theyve all got the real screechy electric guitars now
n-
yeah if im going to listen to todays country western i have tapes of like $unc$randy $unc$travis and $unc$clint $unc$black
yeah
and i even liked $unc$jim $unc$reeves
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i
yeah uh-huh
or $unc$merle $unc$haggard and $unc$faron $unc$young
uh-huh
that type of country western is what i like to listen to $unc$sons of the $unc$pioneers stuff like that
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i like sound tracks a lot
do you
yeah
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way
yeah
you sure do
think about like the $unc$twin $unc$peaks and stuff like that thats just real recent
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
things like that i like to listen to
i like instrumental things
uh-huh
i have some $unc$spiro $unc$gyro tapes
theyre great arent they
theyre wonderful
yeah
i love them
i have some dulcimer music
i mean like i said thats pretty varied
yeah
it sure is
yeah
$unc$al $unc$jarreau hes somebody i like
hes kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
uh-huh
yeah
i like his
he has a nice smooth voice
yeah
and what i like the most about him is ive gone to see him in concert and he looks like hes having fun
yeah
sure
some people sing
and they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something
but he looks like hes having a good time
hes up there moving around and smiling like hes happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
uh-huh
sure
and he is real fun to listen to
uh-huh
$unc$bonnie $unc$rait i like her a lot
uh-huh
in fact whenever she won her big $unc$grammy
uh-huh
i think it was like $unc$five of them or something
uh-huh
was it $unc$five
or
yeah
something like that
it was last year wasnt it
yeah
last year or the year before i cant remember
but i was listening to a particular radio station
and the $unc$one $unc$d $unc$j said who the heck is $unc$bonnie $unc$rait and why does she deserve $unc$five $unc$grammies
i vowed then that i was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that $unc$d $unc$j can make such a unedu-
this is $unc$archie
hi $unc$archie
im $unc$sharon
have you seen dancing with wolves
yeah
ive seen that
that was a really good movie
probably $unc$one of the best things about it was the scenery
and i thought the story was pretty good too
i think $unc$kevin $unc$costner did a really good job with it
have you ever lived in that part of the country
no
i havent
have you ever visited it
ive visited the $unc$wyoming area
im not sure exactly where dances with wolves was filmed
i think it was the black hills of $unc$south $unc$dakota
could be
i havent been to $unc$south $unc$dakota
have you been up to that
i lived in $unc$omaha for $unc$five winters
oh
okay
and that rolling kind of
terrain
yeah
is fairly famili-
the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics
apparently its going to win everything
really
and i had been told you wouldnt notice that it was $unc$three hours long and all this kind of
thats true
i agree with that
i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it
i think its been nominated for $unc$twelve awards
and all the critics initially said that it wouldnt go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud
so it has surprised everybody
the interesting thing is i had heard that
and i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me its that great
and the thing is it was a good story
uh-huh
right
and i guess thats what i really like
although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour
did you
yeah
have you seen sleeping with the enemy
no
ive heard thats really great though
you have to go see that $unc$one
and how about silence of the lamb
no
go
you must really keep up
i do
i go every weekend
i
those are $unc$two definite must see movies i think
sleeping with the enemy isnt that a
is it a terror movie
or is it just suspenseful
its suspenseful
i dont think its very t-
theres not really any blood and guts in it or anything like that
its more suspense
the other $unc$one silence of the lambs is kind of a gory movie if somebodys not into that kind of stuff
its pretty graphic at points
but i think theyre both excellent movies
do you listen to $unc$gary $unc$cogill
no
is
do you know who he is
yeah
somebody in $unc$south $unc$carolina told me about him
hes the movie critic
youve
okay
hes a movie critic on channel $unc$eight in $unc$dallas
yeah
and he has a talk show on the $unc$k $unc$l $unc$i $unc$f
anyway its on from $unc$seven to $unc$nine or something
and people call in
and if you keep up with movies its kind of interesting
theres a certain a mount of dribble that they do
theyve got a couple of kids $unc$ten or $unc$twelve years old
and they call in
and they review movies
but its
oh
anyway he
its interesting
you listen to him
and then you go watch the movie
in fact people had just seen
i was listening $unc$sunday night a little bit when i was going to pick up my daughter
uh-huh
but anyway it was the
its interesting though
or did he just do it
i think he really
his heart was in it
but i dont think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was
i think it was something that he really wanted to do
he wanted to direct it
he wanted to star in it
he enjoyed the story line
and i think he really wanted it
and whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy
because i think he did a good job
and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver
a little piece of trivia
the guy when he first headed out from the army post
yeah
who
no
i dont know who that guy is
he plays on $unc$murphy $unc$brown
he does
yes
hes $unc$eldon her housepainter
as a recurring character every week
oh
can you believe that
no
id a never put those $unc$two together
thats $unc$one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that
huh-uh
i thought no its really funny
but i thought it
you think back
and yeah
it was him but with the beard and all that stuff
yeah
its
yeah
real scruffy looking
yeah
real scruffy looking
and it was really funny that he winds up playing in the movie
but i thought its good that
it was a lot of fun
yeah
i dont know how long this conversation is supposed to go
but were at about $unc$five minutes
i should think weve done enough
you think so
i havent been watching my watch
i guess
yeah
does it usually cut off
is that what it does
i dont know
why do we end this thing
it used to just automatically cut off
i think it just says hang up
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up
so i guess so
why dont we do that
okay
good-bye $unc$sharon
good talking to you $unc$archie
how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes
we
my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
uh-huh
hes an aerobics instructor and is going to be entering $unc$north $unc$texas for a kinesiology program there
uh-huh
and the
how i met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach
uh-huh
youre a student
yeah
so im an avid aerobics person and just very very athletic
uh-huh
enjoying anything dealing with sports
uh-huh
uh-huh
and how do you feel about it
i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise
i dont feel like i
i dont very often do things for the sake of exercise
i dont feel well unless i am exercising
and i try to do things that involve exercise
but i very rarely do things like
ive never done aerobics or any sort of structured
this is my exercise time
uh-huh
but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that
and i spend a lot of time
and i probably get more exercise than your average person
but its not a structured sort of thing
and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercisings sake
uh-huh
and perhaps its because somehow that implies to me its not fun or something like that
yeah
ive
my
thats the way my mother stands on it
she feels like if its something that you have to do if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes a chore
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
yes
and she doesnt enjoy it when its a chore
and i feel that way too as far as the idea of doing $unc$fifty sit-ups or something
to
uh-huh
uh-huh
youre a calcu-
calculated down
and do your calisthenics $unc$three times a week
uh-huh
but i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
is that why you like aerobics classes because someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore
yeah
and its got
and ive always enjoyed dance
yeah
so it involves
i cant get out to dance all the time
and
yeah
would that we could
yeah
and its more regulated
i mean youre using different parts of the body
uh-huh
uh-huh
so it is like dance
and its structured like that
but you have the music and like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me
yeah
uh-huh
and someone else is telling me okay lets move this way lets move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
yeah
yeah
but im like you
i also like to participate in things like
we just went to the $unc$myererson $unc$symphony $unc$run this past weekend
and that was a lot of fun
and you get to meet different people and just get out out and about
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its something you can all
like our
we did it as a family
so it was quite a lot of fun
uh-huh
uh-huh
and biking
and i love to swim
so i love it when its swimming weather
and
youre talking to someone from $unc$california where its often swimming weather
oh
i didnt realize that
im sorry
im in $unc$texas
i just assumed that i had
this is the first call ive done
uh-huh
and i didnt realize that they were going to reach out to people from all over the country
you wouldnt know that
i
so its actually
its interesting because there are real regional differences
in $unc$california theres almost an assumption unless youre sort of clearly of an older generation or something in your sixties or something like that
im not
theres an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness at least in urban $unc$california
and maybe not
i dont know about rural $unc$california too well
but in urban $unc$california its just
for all i know aerobics started out here
i dont know where they actually started
but the craze really picked up big here
and before that there was the running craze
and they
$unc$california tends to be a bit faddish
but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere
uh-huh
so there must be something to some of them
and
i think people are more inc-
people from $unc$california seem to be more health motivated all around as far as the diet and just your health consciousness
and it just seems like a lot of those ideas generate out of $unc$california
uh-huh
not just exercise but health related ideas
yeah
and i
its curious i dont know why dont know if its
do you
does $unc$california have a
theres a sense of it being a package
i think there is a sense of whole
theres a lot of
youll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever
and the $unc$university of $unc$california at $unc$berkeley puts out the $unc$wellness $unc$letter which turned into a fairly well subscribed to newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
uh-huh
and it doesnt deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything
its on fairly solid scientific ground
its just dispensed with these distinctions
it says all sorts of factors go into health and theres no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they combined them all together
so its had that orientation for quite some time
theres been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach
uh-huh
and
do you think thats because theyve realized that for whole health that you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that theyve incorporated that into their program
boy
do you think the program came first or the
yeah
that
theres a
i can say theres a correlation but i couldnt say which caused the other
each developed a little bit and then would feed off $unc$one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
yeah
the more money they put into it
yeah
and
i can see that
and cause i
knowing
from institutes of learning like that i know that theyve got to get their money somewhere
and somebodys got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it
so
yeah
yeah
exactly
and part of it is $unc$california back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements
and some of them fizzled out
and some of them were disastrous
and others of them had an impact on the society around here
and one of the ones that had an impact was people becoming interested in alternate practices
im not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was similar to a stress management practice or alternates to a m a approved medicine
you have major acupuncture schools and things out here
and you could have them around long enough
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
uh-huh
and before long you get this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of health care and options
uh-huh
and exercise is strongly considered one of them
the irony is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise
and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks
the average person out on the farm now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers
yeah
last thing
or theyre older
pardon me
dont you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-
i sometimes think that its almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city
like everything else
i live in a rural area i see that
yeah
yeah
the rat race to exercise
its frantic to achieve something that a person in a rural area almost doesnt worry about it to such a degree but stays almost healthier
uh-huh
yeah
i think so
as a fit person
youve
if you look at other cultures
i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in $unc$china
and they dont do very much vigorous exercise at all
but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
and they combine it with a meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation
uh-huh
and they seem pretty
they dont have the hard body
they dont have that perfect look
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious
but they live to a $unc$hundred and $unc$ten some
yeah
and thats
dont you think a lot of that is diet too
and a lot of that is diet
thats true
yeah
yeah
they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat for economical reasons not for preference
uh-huh
yeah
and as we can see
im a practicing vegetarian
so ive read a lot of information knowing that to be true
yeah
am i actually
whats that
as am i
are you also
yes
thats good as far as the cal-
is that pretty predominant as far as $unc$california doe-
it is in the urban areas
yes
in the urban areas
for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
uh-huh
thats wonderful
most sort of modern looking restaurants will
yeah
you can
thats great
we
its such a trouble here
you just have to eat at home basically
i was wondering that
because i was actually applying for a job in $unc$texas
and it occurred to me
of course in the cities
yeah
in the cities
we live close to $unc$dallas
uh-huh
so which
you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country
so youre going to have more choices
uh-huh
uh-huh
but in urban areas its steak places
yeah
yeah
and its not a
yeah
its definitely
its changing to a degree and even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic materials and foods and things
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
you dont really have that
you would think
all righty
ill just hand it off to you
and hobbies in our spare time is what weve been selected to discuss today
the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts
and ive been involved in making hat stands and rag dolls and different type hats with flowers and roses and that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff
oh
and i enjoy it
its relaxing
and you kind of get absorbed in it
so the time goes by before you realize anything is going on
and i play the organ sometimes just for my own satisfaction not for anybody elses ears
because im not that good at it
but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
really
how about yourself
hobbies gee whiz
i guess i got too many hobbies
so i never have time to deal with them
really
i like photography a lot
yeah
thats neat
i used to do that a lot
and then i like
we have a new child that will be a year old here next week
so ill take a lot of pictures of her and spoil them
thats great
uh-huh
first one you know how that is
and i play the guitar and a banjo
i mainly play the guitar a lot
i play about every night
and i really love that
if i had a druther
if i could make it on the road id like to play on a bluegrass band or something
because thats
ive
that sounds nice
i like bluegrass too
yeah
ive done it before when i was in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it
uh-huh
and its really a blast
my wife hates it
but thats the way life is i guess
thats the hard part right
exactly
if you can do things together that really helps a lot
yeah
we
shes into aerobics
and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
thats good too
and that went over real well
uh-huh
but thats about it there
its good
and its healthy too
yeah
yeah
we do that too
we have a treadmill and a bicycle and that kind of stuff
we try to get $unc$twenty minutes at least $unc$three for $unc$four times a week
thats great
yeah
thats great
and we like movies
that ki-
yeah
yeah
thats
spare time
with a child its kind of stra-
shes
we have
were looking for a baby-sitter
so weve been out twice in this year so far by ourselves without the child
uh-huh
so its kind of become an issue you could say
sure
hobbies
i like messing around in your house building things and putting cabinets up and those kind of things
yeah
thats great too
uh-huh
yeah
we did some remodeling when we bought a house
we put a kitchen in and that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering
thats fun
its really kind of fun
it is
it really is
especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty
yeah
yeah
exactly
i like things that $unc$two people can do
but i like the quiet of doing things away
kind of gives you some space for yourself
and thats what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create
and i like to crochet and knit
i made some afghans and that kind of stuff
i like doing things with my hands
uh-huh
sounds like it
yeah
do you like to cook
yes
i love to cook
yeah
i love to cook too
im
italian food
really
yeah
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff
were all skinny farts
so i
it
so when it comes to
i like to cook and eat and to have mainly i guess i get to
yeah
amount of people eat and then say man this is really good
uh-huh
yeah
it is
but it just
work in the garden work around the yard of course
do you do barbecues
yes
we sure do
smoke them an-
smoking and all that stuff
yeah
all that hoedown stuff
yeah
yep
all that stuff thats bad for you
i lived in $unc$abilene for a little while and worked in the $unc$abilene plant
sure
yeah
and we used to go to $unc$joe allens barbecue
and that was great
yeah
really great
thats only way to do it
they have some nice stuff down there
i miss it
yeah
its
theres pluses to everything
yeah
but seems like theres just so many things to do down here
i like the sports
i play a lot of racquetball
i did horseback riding too
in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses
and that was kind of for them
but they werent as interested in it as we were
so that was a real
id say probably for maybe $unc$fifteen years we dabbled in that
we always had horses around
and i really enjoyed that
thats great
sounds like you
and i was disappointed when i went to $unc$texas
i didnt see that many of them
horses
yes
yeah
you really dont
yeah
the
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete
i know
i know
its true
theres buildings and concrete and a lot of people
and thats about it down here
and so
uh-huh
yeah
but thats great
sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there
yeah
you too
you too
great
look
i know its probably late for you
okay
i enjoyed speaking with you
me too
have a good weekend
okay
bye-bye
bye
the thing is that i
since im in school i dont basically have a monthly budget because im living off my dad
but the thing is that i have to keep it under control because for example its like the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough
but he controls that part
but then whenever
its like once the semester starts im the one who has to control how much spending there is
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food
so
what about tuition and rent
who takes care of that
the thing is that i live in a dorm
so what happens is you pay $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts
yeah
and then the tuition is also the same thing
so the thing is basically that i spend maybe $unc$thirty-five $unc$forty dollars every $unc$two weeks on groceries
and thats about it
but the thing also is that if you want to go out if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because its like i cant go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend $unc$twenty dollars $unc$three times a week
no
you cant do that very often
so its
for us its like i can spend that money
but its not what i want to spend it on
are you working anywhere while you are going to school
no
okay
because they dont allow me to work since im a foreign student
okay
and so the government doesnt allow me to work
yeah
so all the money comes from home
uh-huh
so you got to make
so how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending
the thing is that i basically know how much i have right
right
and so the thing is that i can tell
i get all my money out of the teller
yeah
and besides one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call international
where do you call to
$unc$argentina
$unc$argentina
yeah
wow
and so the bas-
$unc$one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills
yeah
talk too long
thats
they want me to call down there every so often
yeah
i told my dad $unc$dad listen if you want to save money i wont call so often
he goes we want to keep in touch
so i doesnt matter about the money because we need to hear from you
yeah
so you call him collect
no
because it is more expensive that way
what makes you think so
any
basically the $unc$united $unc$states is the cheapest country to call out of
yeah
and because its considered a luxury in other countries
okay
you just call him direct
and then
right
since its his money anyway
yeah
and you get the bill and send it to him
no
i got money to pay that too
okay
so its basically
its not too much money
and its not too little money
so i wont have to rush a letter to him or something
yeah
because he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
yeah
what are you studying
im doing masters in computer science and computer engineering
and what do you think youll do with that
with those degrees
uh-huh
i can work here up to a year
and
and hopefully get a job after that
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing
or whats the specialty that your looking for
computer communications and data transmissions
okay
so you want to find a data transmissions
youre looking for long distance type stuff
right
yeah
anywhere from local area networks metropolitan area networks all that
and so you have a family right
yeah
i have a wife and $unc$two children
and
and does your wife work
no
she doesnt work
she does
its kind of hard to say now days other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself
okay
and she gets paid for that
so she brings some money in
yeah
she is trying to start her own business where she does that full time alterations and sewing stuff for the public
okay
yeah
and do that on a full time basis here in town
and you have a monthly budget
sort of
were probably like most american families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much weve got at the end of the month
right
and we know what bills have to be paid
and we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget
so
you dont have any problem in overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that
sure
were like everybody else
weve got several credit cards that sometimes instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around $unc$christmas time
yeah
yeah
thats when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff
thats $unc$one of the points which i dont see
i dont give a lot of gifts during $unc$christmas
and i dont like to give any at all
yeah
because the thing is that its like if i want something ill ask somebody
yeah
for $unc$christmas my roommate goes what do you want
and i said i want a backpack
yeah
no
i told him if you want to give me a present for $unc$christmas give me a backpack
yeah
thats something that you can use
right
because i needed a backpack
so he gave me a backpack
and i knew he needed an alarm clock
yeah utilitarian
so i bought him an alarm clock
so the thing was that
right
but
necessary things no frivolous gifts
right
but the thing is especially remember when i was down in $unc$argentina to me it was ridiculous
because you have to
once a year you go out
and you spend all this money on all these people
and some you dont care about
its like
thats true
why bother
yeah
yeah
but the thing is that
especially being a college student your
i dont know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving
yeah
that effects the budget especially around $unc$christmas time
at the end of the semester youve got finals and lots of bills i would suspect
yeah
what about when you have breaks like $unc$christmas or between sessions
for example we had spring break now
and i went skiing
and i spent around like maybe $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars
i expect so
but its like
youve got to budget that though
youve got to save up in able to do that right
yeah
yeah
because its like we were saying lets go eat out before spring break
i go lets not go eat out before spring break
lets see how much money we have afterwards
right
and if i felt like i spent way to much then i wont go out
right
and so my roommate went home
i went skiing over the $unc$carolina mountains which arent anything
but i guess it was worth it
sure it is
any time you can get away and get away from the daily grind
it was a nice place
yeah
yeah
yeah
especially if you live on campus and you dont have a car you just go crazy
yeah
i know the feeling
so lets see how long have we been talking here
$unc$six minutes and a half
okay
is that okay
yeah
all right
all right
nice talking to you
nice talking to you
have a good time
all right
bye-bye
bye
okay
what do you like to cook
i like to cook foods i like to eat
i like to eat italian food best
uh-huh
and i find that thats pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is $unc$one dish meals type things and theyre kind of convenient
uh-huh
that would be good for a dinner party to cook that because you dont have to deal with $unc$eight different things coming out at once
right
is that what you usually cook when you have a party
i usually have parties that are smaller groups
ive never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like $unc$thanksgiving and such
uh-huh
and so yeah
i guess i usually do
i like to cook heavy sauces and noodles and pasta and such
really
that sounds good
fattening
yeah
actually
how about you
what do you like to cook
we
its funny that were talking about this
we just had a dinner party
and we had
our senior pastor and his wife came over
uh-huh
and i catered to their diet is the only thing though
so it wasnt something i really wanted to make
i really wanted to make red beans and rice with sausage
yeah
because im from $unc$new $unc$orleans originally
uh-huh
and i was going to make that red beans and rice with those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff
and theres salad
and then for desert i really wanted to make just brownies
or french donuts would have been good
but its real hard to make them
they dont really come out like they do in $unc$new $unc$orleans up here
i dont know why
really
i dont know if its me or the water or the recipe i have
but
humidity or something
thats what i want
thats what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that
but
uh-huh
kind of like the italian
its really good
but instead i catered to their diet
so i made baked chicken in the crock pot
and it was good and everything
it had all the vegetables in it
but it seemed kind of boring compared
it kind of down played compared to what you would like huh
right
do you find yourself with all the cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you entertain
i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain
because i guess i feel like if theyre on a diet like that im going to honor that
but if its just
another couple came over a couple weeks later
and i made
what did i make that night
i made a roast
uh-huh
and i made
i cant believe this
my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday
no
i cant believe that
anyway but i asked
when $unc$ricky and $unc$carrie came over we made a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit
uh-huh
and normally we dont eat like that during the week because of the calories and the fat in it
uh-huh
but when were having guests we just kind of say oh just do it
and i made blueberry cobbler
and we had extra crust with it
yeah
it was so fattening
that sounds good
but i dont think we gained any weight from it
so
every once in a while i think i feel the same way
when im entertaining i dont take that thing into consideration unless its really really
a lot of women will turn down dessert if its too rich simply because they dont want the extra calories
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
right
i made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over
and she didnt eat it
yeah
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies
i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
yeah
yeah
so ive read a good brownie recipe
thats good
anyway so i guess thats about what i did when i entertained
uh-huh
so do you have anything else you want to say about it
nothing comes to mind right off
so i guess not
okay
it was nice talking to you
okay
you too
okay
bye
bye bye
all right
i would like to talk about just briefly what happened over there in $unc$saudi $unc$arabia in the political context
i think its refreshing to see the support that the president got from the american people
yeah
i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed that
seemed that every other time a $unc$president tried to get support for an action like $unc$president $unc$carter and his thing with the hostage crisis he always did it through rhetoric
right
right
and this time $unc$president $unc$bush did it through action
and he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
yes
or he left almost no alternative
thats right
and it was very interesting how he did it
and im an $unc$air $unc$force $unc$officer
so it was interesting for me
really
id certainly
i think its great that all the support
i have friends of mine from the $unc$air
im an engineer and work in the $unc$rolm $unc$laboratory
right
but other guys here on base
this is a b $unc$fifty-two base where i work
so we had about a $unc$thousand people gone from the base that went over there
yeah
and theyre getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
thats great
if you remember the vote in the $unc$congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
yes
it was
and if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of $unc$democrats may even have opposed it
it was
yeah
i dont know the exact figure
but i would imagine that because of how close the vote was i mean almost certainly would have to be
just based on the disparity of $unc$democrats and $unc$republicans in $unc$congress hed think that it would have to have been
thats right
and i
gosh this whole thing now with all the political cartoons on the $unc$democrats and how theyre in a sad way for $unc$ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
yeah
especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys lets talk about this little while longer
yeah
yeah
how many years are we going to wait
and what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
right
right
i think that was
all those factors played a part in the
no doubt
everyone was discussing whether we should wait longer
but i know that theres a lot of reasons to wait longer
but i think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability
and i think we over estimated it
but still we were really highly concerned about it
i think so too
and we were worried that they were getting dug in
and
and in fact they were so well dug in that when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldnt get turned around in time
yeah
right
they couldnt
yeah
its true
they
$unc$saddam thought he had the whole thing figured out to which way we were coming and what our doctrine was that
had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
thats right
thats true
thats interesting
i think this political situation over there now is
itll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will
today the $unc$turks agreed to support the $unc$kurds which is something theyve never done before and this
interesting
the $unc$arabs all of a sudden are cheering for $unc$baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the $unc$israelis
so its like
$unc$baker is really not very much pro $unc$israel
yeah
i
and did you know $unc$john $unc$sununu is half $unc$arab
no
i think i did hear that at $unc$one time a long time ago
yeah
because i used to live in $unc$massachusetts
but
right
in fact when he was governor of $unc$new $unc$hampshire i believe
yeah
$unc$new $unc$hampshire
okay
i believe he was the only $unc$one of $unc$fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for $unc$israel a few years back
my gosh
and now he is a conservative
but he is not a conservative that favors $unc$israel
and that concerns me greatly
i dont
yeah
id certainly support $unc$israel in their policy in defending themselves and in their handling of their foreign policy
i think the stand they have or the way the command respect i support that
i think that is a positive thing for them after thousands of years
they ha-
i think they in
when they became a country they more or less decided they werent going to take it anymore
and
they didnt have much choice
they could either fight or die
yeah
exactly exactly
and so gee
i lost my train of thought here
so okay
so i cant say that im pro $unc$israel or anti $unc$israel
id like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
and looks that the joining of forces for this $unc$desert $unc$shield and $unc$desert $unc$storm thing ended up being a positive thing
it is a positive thing
however every time an organization such as the $unc$p $unc$l $unc$o says well see if we can work with $unc$israel then they get embarrassed every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
right
and so you basically have mutually exclusive interests
either $unc$israel is going to occupy the area
or the $unc$arabs are going to occupy the area
and im just not sure that theres going to be any easy permanent solution
yeah
somebodys going to
and i think thats the problem the $unc$p $unc$l $unc$o has is that whenever $unc$one group of them decides that theyre going to negotiate or theyre going to do something theyre going to try to make some peace the end result is that there so many factions of them some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split
they end up becoming divisive themselves
exactly
i
its interesting
it is
im looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months
but thats
yeah
i commend $unc$israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks
yeah
i know
thats absolutely unprecedented
that was an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the $unc$state $unc$department
yeah
exactly
exactly
and thats never happened before
no
and i dont know if it will ever happen again
but
may not
its been fun i enjoyed talking with you
yeah
okay
i guess maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
you never know
all right
bye bye
bye bye
hello
hello there
did i reach the $unc$dallas area
i beg your pardon
did i reach the $unc$dallas area
no
youve reached $unc$dayton $unc$ohio
$unc$dayton $unc$ohio
im from $unc$north $unc$carolina
youre from $unc$north $unc$carolina
where in $unc$north $unc$carolina
in $unc$raleigh
raleigh
great
yeah my name is fernando
my names $unc$mary
fernando glad to know you
so do you
howd you find out about this
i was visiting my son down in $unc$dallas
and
okay
he works for $unc$t $unc$i
no
no
but his wife has a contract with $unc$t $unc$i
and thats how we learned about it
$unc$uh-huh
okay
because im down at $unc$n $unc$c $unc$state
yeah
$unc$uh-huh
and so i took a class
and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for $unc$five minutes
right
so are you ready
im ready
okay
lets get started
all right
okay
okay
so what do you think that
what do you think we can do to solve the crime in $unc$america
if i knew that id be a very wealthy person
yeah
but what are the steps
you have to see
the way i look at it you have to think first of all why
or has crime increased
and if so why has crime increased
the problem is that what happens is that as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right
uh-huh
because in the country people still respect the property of other people
right
and so as
and the people in the country dont want as much as the people in the city
uh-huh
what happens is all those that dont have any money in the country move to the cities
and they rush to get the same thing
they say why cant we have the same things that these other people have
and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs
and what we have to do is we have to go get some stuff steal it and then just resell it
its easy
you said the magic word there
which one
drugs
yeah
and that certainly is $unc$one reason why crime here has increased
thats the main reason i think everywhere
because you have deaths
you have murders
and you have people stealing other peoples stuff
and thats
a lot of it has to do with drugs
yes
it doesnt have to do
the thing is that its like you might be standing somewhere right
and lets say youre driving out
and youre driving back home
and its late at night
and you stop by one of these $unc$twenty-four hour gas stations joints
yeah
and somebody walks in there with a gun
theyre going to want the money
and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs
they dont want the money so they can do something else with it
no
they dont want the money for food
thats for sure
right
right
and so
but perhaps not strange but something that many people dont realize is that you can go back as far as $unc$nineteen $unc$fifty-one and $unc$fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids
because im a retired educator
okay
and in $unc$fifty-one and $unc$fifty-two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the $unc$one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on
yeah
so its a problem thats been around for over $unc$forty years
and were just really now trying to figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
yeah
theres a song that i know which says tha-
its like in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-eight $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in $unc$america
and their figures i think are so
its like compared to weapons or stuff like that youre spending nothing on crime in the country itself
what youre doing is you
its like you have other things
you have the aids
were going to try to solve the aids problem while some people are getting killed here and there
uh-huh
and then
yeah
and another $unc$one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be part of the power structure thats keeping us from spending the money in that direction
uh-huh
but those people never get caught
the people that i
thats right
theyll never get caught
their theory is that if im surrounded and im going to be caught im going to try to find my way through
and theyre not going to take me alive
uh-huh
but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
thats right
but theyll
its like
of course i might be the leading drug dealer here
but you wont find me dealing in drugs
theres no connection between me and the people that were caught
thats right
thats right
and they
$unc$one person doesnt know the other person down the line
right
but the guy at the very top the one whos really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing
yeah
because it sure is monstrous in this country
yeah
i was at a party on $unc$saturday
and this guy comes over
he goes hey how you doing
he started talking to me
and this guy was from $unc$jamaica right
uh-huh
and hes got his little brother selling drugs
uh-huh
and he goes yeah i just came up here to work
and i go oh you did you make very good money up here
he goes yeah i make a lot of money
he goes
and in the movie good fellows
yeah
might
did you see it
nope
i only heard about it
okay
in $unc$one part the guy goes out of jail
and within $unc$two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid
uh-huh
and he had enough money to
its like those guys at $unc$one point they had so much money that they didnt know what to do with it
yeah
really
even in our prison systems theyre finding that theyre having drugs smuggled into them
yeah
yeah
that was also in the movie
right
yeah
hello $unc$mary
been nice talking with you
weve been talking for $unc$five minutes
i beg your
weve been talking for a little bit
i appreciate the call
i enjoyed talking with you
all right okay
same here
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
$unc$cindy have you seen dances with wolves
no
i havent
have you
that is a wonderful movie
uh-huh
its not
the length isnt too long
no
uh-huh we all heard different opinions about it
goodness no
you dont even realize it
really
uh-huh
$unc$one that
yeah
it was too long
and they thought at certain points that it was going to end
and it didnt
and it kept going on
and
uh-huh
i thought it was great
really
yeah
ive seen some different clips of it
and it looks good
its just i havent had the time to go to the movies lately
yeah
and i heard a story about theres a certain scene in the movie where theyre on a buffalo hunt
uh-huh
and they have a particular child actor whos being supposedly run down by a buffalo
uh-huh
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was $unc$neil youngs buffalo
uh-huh
i cant remember what they said his name was
but he has a fetish for $unc$oreo cookies
uh-huh
oh
and he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with $unc$oreo cookies
hey
thatd work for me
let me tell you
i thought that was really funny
uh-huh
uh-huh
now ive seen another clip of the guy that plays in $unc$murphy $unc$brown
i dont know his name
but he played the character in it that was very dirty
an-
yeah
i saw the $unc$one clip of him
and ugh
it was first
i guess he was taking $unc$kevin $unc$costner to the site where he was going to be or whatever
yeah
that was rather gross
yeah
the wagon driver
yeah
yeah
but other than that ive heard the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful
yeah
and the costuming was
uh-huh
really
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that the indians all appeared to be wearing new things
really
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
they did very authentic reproductions of the actual stuff
the styles
uh-huh
but they didnt age it quite enough it seemed
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it was a very good movie
uh-huh
i guess i will have to see it then
what have you seen lately
actually have been to the movies
i think the last movie i saw was misery
i didnt see that
very suspenseful
i dont like $unc$stephen $unc$king
i really dont either
but i went with someone
and once i was there i couldnt believe
its an excellent movie
really
yeah
i wasnt sure
because just generally that kind of scary stuff i just dont want to have anything to do with it
its not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful
its not
yeah
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something
no
in the book apparently she cuts his feet off
but in the movie she disables him but not by cutting his feet
she breaks both of his ankles
ugh
and that i couldnt watch
but you could tell when it was coming
yeah
so yeah
that was so that he couldnt leave her
cause she
it still just seems a little twisted to me
yeah
yeah yeah
im not sure i would have enjoyed that at all
well as far as that goes
yeah
you wouldnt like to see anything happen to anybody
but it was just how she got so caught up
her emotions
yeah
and she feel madly in love with this writer
uh-huh
and there was this
but she was a killer
and the character prior to that had been someone that had killed other people
yeah
but no one knew that
yeah
but
so yeah
we just havent had the time to go to the movies lately
i know
we dont see movies at the movies a lot
uh-huh
the last
we did go see dances with wolves
and we went to see not without my daughter
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape
and then we rent them
right
right
now i want to see sleeping with the enemy yeah
yeah
that looks really good too
that looks good
and there were a couple others that i just havent had the time
and silence of the lambs
i
im intrigued by it
but im not sure i want to go see it yet
yeah
i dont think i want to see that either
i know
i dont think i could
i think
we had some friends that went to see it
and they said it was okay
really
so it might not be as
i think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that arent the main aspects
really
uh-huh
we went to see the jagged edge
i liked that movie
yeah
yeah
so it seems like that kind of thriller suspense and not real strange in other ways
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess thats about it
it was nice
okay
maybe well talk to you again
okay
it was nice talking to you
alright
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
lets see
i think
i guess if i call im supposed to start
i think thats the way everybody has done it so far
okay
but anyway i think that we are paying a lot in taxes
but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money
were probably $unc$one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have
the
as far as the quality of the streets the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to all the things that the government does like that i think they need to manage it a little bit better
but i dont think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because theyve been messing it up for many years now
so
i have to agree that
yeah
and youre right
we do have a good government
we do have a lot of things that the taxes are there to support
but i do think theyre mismanaged
and i think that sometimes its i dont know to easy of an answer
it seems to say ill tax them if you cant get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or get all of the waste out of the spending
huh-uh
i dont know what yall are paying in $unc$dallas
but it seems like we pay the state
theres a
the taxes set by the state and the city can add theirs
and the county adds theirs
and were paying almost $unc$eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts
i came from $unc$california
and when i left there we paid $unc$six cents on the dollar
and that was one of the highest in the nation
right
i think its $unc$seven here
yeah
$unc$seven point something
yeah
ourselves is $unc$seven point $unc$seven $unc$five
huh-uh
whole state
yeah
it drives me crazy
im thinking everybody is sitting here screaming about we dont want a state income tax
but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
and they dont do anything about it
right
where are you at
what state
im in $unc$lubbock $unc$texas
really
yeah
yeah
theres
were still $unc$one of few that dont have the state tax
thats true
and i did pay state tax in $unc$california
but my goodness
that
what did you call it the sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
yeah
thats true
you dont sound like youre from $unc$dallas
where do you come from originally
$unc$texas
yeah
i do
ive lived in the $unc$dallas area here since i was like $unc$four
okay
its i dont know an urban area i guess
whatever
i dont know
you just managed to escape the real texan accent
yeah
i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
no
no
ive just lived here
yeah
but i dont know
i do
i can think of all the biblical things about it too
what did they say to
i cant think of the scripture
render unto caesars what is caesars
thats right
even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and $unc$jesus said the money or in the fisher inside the fish
yeah
and i thought of those $unc$two things when i was holding for a long time
were you really trying to find someone at home
yeah
yeah
back then what they tried to do
the would always try to stump $unc$jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself
right
and so thats what they were trying to do with the tax situation
and of course thats when he said well you render unto caesars what is caesars
you render unto $unc$god what is gods
right
and of course there
i dont think they really cared about the answer
right
they just wanted to try and catch him in something
yeah
but i believe in paying taxes
and yeah
like everybody else i try to take as many deductions as i can
sure
i dont want to pay more than i have to
sure
and i get outraged when i feel like they go up for useless reasons
but i believe that theyre necessary
right
i really do
yeah
are
do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work
or
no
not really
i spends a lot of time with our income tax though especially this year and last year
i have been married for just a few years
so ive had to really switch around from the $unc$e $unc$z form to the
$unc$schedule $unc$a
right
yeah
all the deductions and all that
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder
yeah
it really did
i saw that too
i didnt notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions the interest and other things
right
right
were looking at buying a house
yeah
and that was $unc$one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house
and it will help tremendously
yeah
we bought ours $unc$five years ago
and its
the $unc$one thing
it seems like you make those payments every month
and at the end of the year youve paid all interest and no principles
right
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
yeah
theres a thing i just
ive been trying to learn as much as i can about it
if you pay
i know i get paid twice a month every $unc$two weeks
$unc$huh-uh
thats once a month
$unc$huh-uh
i get $unc$twenty $unc$six paychecks which would come out to be in $unc$thirteen months
thats right
so if you pay your rent or your house payment every $unc$two weeks instead of once a month youll come out paying $unc$one month extra every year
$unc$huh-uh
thats right
and if have you a $unc$thirty year note it will take like $unc$seven or plus years off of your note
thats right
my parents bought a home in $unc$san $unc$diego about $unc$four or $unc$five years ago
and they did that
they thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other $unc$wednesday
yeah
and thats exactly right
everyone
though the note is $unc$thirty years she said its going be paid off in $unc$twenty or $unc$twenty $unc$one years or something like that
right
yeah
just because of exactly what you said
right
youre making $unc$one more months payment every year
and thats going on the principle
it doesnt pay any interest
yeah thats a good way to do it
or usually it doesnt
yeah
and when we bought this house we looked at doing a $unc$fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts
huh-uh
it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
right
thats what were looking at $unc$fifteen or maybe $unc$twenty
yeah
were not going to go longer than $unc$twenty
yeah
but were taking our time
were going to try to make our decision by $unc$july
thats good though
we just started $unc$two or $unc$three weeks ago
yeah
and were not going to just kill ourselves
just $unc$two or $unc$three houses a week at the most
thats good though
yeah
is it kind of a buyers market down there
absolutely
yeah
thats good
credit union has $unc$nine percent interest
thats pretty excellent
yeah
so thats
i dont know
we couldnt think of a better time to buy than now
thats good
but anyway i cant think of a whole lot more to say
i cant either
i appreciate the call though
yeah
me too
i enjoyed talking to you
yeah
same here
my wife she went to the school out there in $unc$lubbock
in $unc$lubbock
she was there for $unc$two or $unc$three years before we got married
i guess before i even met her
just a second
okay
go ahead
but anyway
so she was at school out here
she went to school there
what was her name
$unc$cathy $unc$walker
no
i didnt know any $unc$walkers
yeah
good luck in your house hunting
yeah
thanks a lot
yall work at $unc$t $unc$i
i do
you do
yeah
im in human resources
really
yeah
thats interesting
i work in the waiver
do you really
because thats
i work with $unc$elma
really
yeah
yeah
and i used to work
i did all of their capital and financial planning for about $unc$eight years
wow
and then i have been in $unc$human $unc$resources for the last $unc$two years
and i work with those same people all those $unc$nine years
so i feel kind of part of the staff
yeah
yeah
yeah
im turning in a capital request right now
you are
yeah
thats funny thats where youre from
what are trying to get
a machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers
oh
okay
so you work in back grind
yeah
im sort of an acting process engineer
okay
not officially
but thats pretty much what i do
thats what you do
yeah
and do you
right
and
good deal
what did you think of $unc$sam
i like him
hes hard
but we needed that
thats good
yeah
hes
he was very good for $unc$lubbock when he came to
it was the same kind of thing
he had a lot of good results
yeah
thats what he said here
good
hes gotten us into a linear flow that weve never been in before
good
thats been a real big plus
good
hes broadened the devices that were making too which has made us as lot more stable
okay
thats good
anyway it was nice to talk to you
you too
and
theyre are going to interrupt us any minute now
i can tell
i know they will
and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed
okay
yeah
me too
have a good day
you too
bye
bye-bye
okay
why do you think it sounds
do you think we should adopt it
no
i dont like metric system
you dont
i think the country is too ingrained in the inches and just the general background
the history of our country has been inches
and i dont think theres a big advantage in going to the metric system
uh-huh
its going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they dont understand simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and how far away something is
yeah
and its not in our national consciousness to do it
weve always measured things in the english system and everything
yeah
our land is in acres
our people arent going to understand what an amount of something is
right
yeah
i agree with you
i dont think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system
i dont think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in $unc$america
yeah
and also the
i dont know
it seems almost like its a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so well look good to the other nations
because i think thats an area that the other nations especially $unc$europe look down on us like were just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who havent really attained it yet
and i feel its just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us
and its like hey were content with this
no
its probably not as accurate
probably intellectually doesnt
its not as sound intellectually but like you said come on
i had $unc$six years of college
and i dont know the metric system and i dont care to learn it
yeah
and im not some kind of an idiot
i just
and its easy to trans-
we have a computer for just about everything now
and if its necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done
yeah
because im a mechanical engineer
and ive had to work when i was designing packages for people
i had to work both systems back and forth
uh-huh
and it was not hard
and you can get a $unc$cat $unc$cam system that can take any design you want
and you can push a button
and itll convert every measurement on there from $unc$one system to the other in seconds
right
theres a lot of people
youre educated
im educated
my husband is
but a lot of people are flat not educated
and if i have a hard time putting that into my life can we put that off on the other $unc$eighty percent of the population that doesnt have any college
really
or i dont know how much of the
yeah
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they dont have any college probably much at all
absolutely
and if we cant take it and use it easily how can you put that on elderly people and just people that maybe just arent blessed with as much sharpness and mental acuity
yeah
its just
or even have had the chance to go to college or to learn about
yeah
i think its still good they do cover the system
i think it should still be taught in schools
yeah
and they do
i know now because i
even when i was in elementary school years ago we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and basically the other alternate forms of measurements things like that
uh-huh
right
yeah
and thats acceptable
yeah
i think it failed too
because like what you said hey this is ridiculous
the thing $unc$americans have so much stress on them right now
yeah
if you look at the average family its like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas theyre really getting and do all this
really
its like come on lets take the pressure
you know you need $unc$twenty gallons but you need how many liters
yeah
and its just like another thing
yeah
the american family doesnt need any more pressure
just leave them alone
let them measure their drinking water in cups
and leave them alone
yeah
and it just doesnt make that much difference in the average life
and the scientific community and places where its needed thats fine
yeah
and the rest of the world we are
its not
we may not be the top
i dont know if were the top
were $unc$one of the top superpowers of the world
uh-huh
thats
it may be arrogant
but let them come to us
thats kind of the way i feel about it
we can convert
and if they dont like the way we do it just dont worry about it and i think
yeah
its kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak $unc$german
right
it is
because it is another language
yeah
yeah
and instead of saying the world speak $unc$german we found out that we can translate
and thats what i think we ought to do with the metric system
thats funny
thats good
i think we kept it at real good
okay
is that all we need to say
yeah
its been nice talking to you
you too
i think that was good
okay
that was the best $unc$one
usually i get distracted off the topic
you know what i mean
yeah
and well end up $unc$one man was telling me about his grandfather in $unc$lithuania
and we were talking about income tax or something
all right
and i just
good talking to you
anyway i appreciate it
have a good day
bye-bye
all right
like i told you before
and youre talking about credit cards
uh-huh
we put ours up
i had a delightful evening $unc$one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
i wish i had
you should try it
i
it was done for me after a while
i had a business going
and this was back in the eighties
i dont know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that
but i had a coin shop
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up
and it started falling
yeah
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards
and things got worse and worse
and finally boom
you lost your business
yep
gol
what a nightmare
yeah
it was
i ended up going into bank-
it was $unc$one of those things
itll get better next week
things will pick up
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court
you werent charging gold and silver were you
you cant do that can you
yeah
you can
yeah
yeah
i was buying from other dealers
and they take payment any way they can get it
thats a nightmare
yeah
course on merchandise that i was buying on cards i was getting the money back
because i was selling it
i wasnt buying just to hold onto it
but it was things like rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up
uh-huh
i remember before i got married
when you graduate from college theyll send you all those credit card applications
uh-huh
uh-huh
of course you fill them all out because youre honored
sure
and i had stuff for $unc$sanger $unc$harris
and it got up like to couple of $unc$hundred dollars
and i thought well thats okay cause all they wanted was $unc$ten dollars a month
uh-huh
right
yeah
i wasnt thinking a thing about it
thats the way they suck you in
yeah
i was just stupid
and every time they had a sale there i was
uh-huh
because get such good bargains
uh-huh
and i dont know
just today in the mail i got my guaranteed acceptance by $unc$american $unc$express
yeah
weve been getting those
yeah
i went back to school and got my masters
and they started sending those things to me again
yeah
as soon as youre a graduate student they get your name
yeah
they did
and course i guess ive been purged from their records
i used to have an $unc$american $unc$express
back when i had my business i got one
uh-huh
and they goofed up bad on my very first bill
because i was using the $unc$american $unc$express strictly for the travel expenses
yeah
and the bill would come in
and id pay it
and the very first bill i paid it
and then i got this nasty letter from them saying youre overdue pay
so i said it just crossed in the mail
so i didnt do anything about it
$unc$two weeks later i get another letter even nastier
and said were going to turn this over to our attorneys if you dont pay
and i looked at that
and i said uh-huh
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank
so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks
turned out they werent cheeky
yeah
they were i tell you
they dont talk about theyre charging that enormous fee every year
so what is it now
its up to $unc$fifty-five on the gold card
its eighty-five for the $unc$optima
or no
$unc$fif-
no
$unc$fif-
what do you mean $unc$fifty-five
you mean $unc$fifty-five dollars
yeah
for the green card
but then whats the interest
thats the card see
and interest is like $unc$eighteen or something
yeah
yeah
its
of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isnt any
but on the $unc$optima card its
lets see right now its running at about
its not too bad
its about $unc$sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go
yeah
credit cards
theyre dangerous
my parents dont hardly use them
huh-uh
mine dont either
mine dont either
they
my mom has a $unc$mastercard and a $unc$visa card
and thats it
ive got all my gas cards because i dont want to carry money around
yeah
ill do that
yeah
now i do use gas cards
$unc$impact is kind of bad too though
yeah
especially if you forget to record those little suckers
yeah
exactly
plastic is just too easy
thats the whole problem with it
uh-huh
and youre tempted if youve got cash a little bit of cash and you dont have enough for the purchase right
yeah
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash
sure
naturally
thats
i got into all kinds of trouble doing that having been out of the credit game for some years now ive gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it
what are you saying
my husband says i might buy it
but i dont really usually consider that an option
maybe thats how we got in trouble
and
yeah
but its hard isnt it
it is
but im kind of grateful for the experience because its taught me a lot of restraint
it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic
yeah
exactly
i just went out and got a new $unc$v $unc$c $unc$r yesterday with cash
with cash
and its
do you work with $unc$t $unc$i
no
no
i wish i did
yeah
you could have got a discount couldnt you
yeah
i could use a discount
i have to wait for things to go on sale
but theres always a sale
yeah
especially on electronic goods
yeah
especially now
what is that thing i saw
$unc$circuit $unc$world or something
$unc$circuit $unc$city
$unc$circuit $unc$city
have you been in there
yeah
their prices arent that terrific
they used to be
but theyve got to pay for all that national advertising now
its national
uh-huh
i think ive seen $unc$two around $unc$dallas
yeah
theyre all over the country now
what else
they used to be good
i remember when they first opened up
they did have good bargains
i dont know if you have a place there called
or you probably have something similar
we call it $unc$service $unc$merchandise
yeah
in $unc$garland
you got $unc$service $unc$merchandise
uh-huh
yeah
it used to be $unc$service $unc$merchandise was the place to go
and $unc$circuit $unc$city came along
and that was the place to go to get your t v and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price
and actually $unc$service $unc$merchandise is cheaper than them now
so
so much for $unc$circuit $unc$city
okay
what else can we talk about
who do you work for
i dont
im a graduate student
im a professional student
sounds wonderful
it is
we were talking about that just today
its great
we could be just lifelong students
it is great
i love it
where are you going to school
$unc$n $unc$c $unc$state
whats that
$unc$north $unc$carolina $unc$state
so youre on spring break
not yet
ours doesnt start until next week
so where are you
where am i
yeah
what do you mean where
oh
in $unc$raleigh
okay
little
the burgeoning metropolis of $unc$raleigh
what a dead place
is it
yeah
ive got a nice little business at home
and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time
so what are you getting your degree in
human factors
and what do you do with it
not a thing
what is it
its really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them
so its sociology
its more psychology and engineering
my masters is in industrial engineering
so youre working on your doctorate
yeah
lord
$unc$p $unc$h $unc$d in human factors
that will sound wonderful wont it
get you a little plaque
yeah
$unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
a lot of people use human factors
folks
but $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m is what im looking at right now
arent they laying off several $unc$thousand people
they might be
but not at the human factors level
theyre
i heard it on the news today
i could swear it was $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
no
as a matter of fact the $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m or in $unc$carey which is a little suburb of $unc$raleigh just hired $unc$one more human factors person
doggone it
if theyd just waited a little bit longer it could have been im going into the dissertation this summer
how much longer do you have
and get that done this summer
im going to start this summer
i probably wont finish it until the end of the year
ooh
but im trying to get a intern position with $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in
because you
its hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field
why
there has been so much work done already
yeah
thats
that and its limited application in some respects
in the area that were in here theres a lot of places that use human factors people
most
hi
hi
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i took on a painting project in my bathroom
and i had wallpaper up
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that
and it took me all weekend
because the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down
and that had to dry
and then the spackling had to dry a day
and then the painting took another day
you didnt try rewallpapering
you just
no
i just painted
did you use a textured paint
or
no
actually the wall behind the paper was smooth
so i just used a semigloss
and
did you get good results
no
not really
i need to
it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were
yeah
i need to either paper back over it or do something
but it didnt cover it
yeah
it covered the spots pretty good
but it just didnt look as smooth as i wanted it to
we did a
we moved last $unc$august
and were getting a house
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den
and we decided
we went to ive forgotten $unc$one of the paint stores
and they just said you can get by
and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
uh-huh
more or less
after about half dozen coats it looks reasonable
but it kept
the dark
it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling
uh-huh
and it was smooth
and we put this stuff on
and it supposedly textured it or did something to it
but because of the dark behind it it was really hard to cover
and
was it like a primer
yeah
it was something like that although when we got through i wished we hadnt done it
because we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
and we were painting it and trying to make it
and it really was
the advice they give you is
the job was considerably tougher than we thought
yeah
particularly when you try to
i was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood panelling
and they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
and it seemed like it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
and the people quoted $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars to paint it or something
my goodness
thats an awful lot
have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
not inside
when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it
that was $unc$one of the requirements from $unc$f $unc$h $unc$a that the house be painted before we bought it
yeah
and it was fairly reasonable
we have a brick house
but all the trim around the house was
yeah
if i remember right it was like $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars
thats quite reasonable
yeah
yeah
so that wasnt too bad
problem i-
have you tried matching paint lately
no
i havent
my wife
we built a shed over the long way
actually it took
this is not on the topic
but i did finish it
but my wife went to the $unc$home $unc$depot i think it was and took a piece of brick
uh-huh
and she wanted to paint the shed
its a wooden shed
and she took it
and theyve got this machine that matches the color of paint
uh-huh
and they got
and in fact she put some right ba-
she got
they mixed a gallon of it
and its just remarkable how close it will match the paint
and it does it electronically something magic
oh
so they did do a good job
yeah
they
but its electronic
yeah
you put your sample under this thing
and it looks at it and determines the
and its really remarkable
the problem they had
and then they wanted some gray to do the trim
uh-huh
but didnt occur to them that they could have taken a sample from
uh-huh
i forgotten
this is $unc$sherwin $unc$williams paint or something
but anyway its remarkable
thats $unc$one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the
you want this to look like this
and you want that to look like that
and of course if its all white youre all right
uh-huh
but when you start getting into colors
have you had problems getting colors to match
yeah
yeah
as a matter of fact what weve got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue
and the blue even $unc$two years later or so it doesnt match
its the very same type of paint and everything
gosh
so you
so whats your
whats the solution then
i have no idea
i repainted the whole thing
my
at least youll get very good at it right
yeah
you could go back and paint the whole thing over
yeah
this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
because it seems like everybody has to go in and do
ill just do a little bit here and a little there
yeah
although the
it
we almost $unc$one day
we painted the house to
we painted the whole inside
and it had all this dark trim
we thought
we did the $unc$one wall but the other trim
im trying to think
i think we left most of it because it gets to be
they dont do that in the newer houses now
we dont
yeah
the mold everything is white
in a new house everything is white
white
yeah
thats what were trying to get ours to look like
good luck
we wound up selling the house
yeah
actually i dont know whether it made
actually it does
its interesting that the white makes the rooms look bigger
$unc$one of the
in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding like picture frames i dont know what you that actually that are along the walls up a couple of feet
uh-huh
uh-huh
and my wife painted the insides of those dark blue
i see
and it makes the room look remarkably smaller
she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color
the trim is still white
okay
the molding
white
uh-huh
but by
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive
yeah
but it makes the room look smaller which is
yeah
it explains why they have everything white
but maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
yeah
yeah
but
what about the lighting
did it make a big difference
not particularly
because the house has so many windows
uh-huh
it has
the living room has $unc$four good size windows
and of course at night
but with the
we have a soccer field thats about a $unc$hundred yards from our house
uh-huh
and the lights shine right at our house
its kind of
we didnt know that when we bought the house
but
so that
you get some
the color doesnt really matter because you have that light
yeah
we have a lot of light
yeah
and i think its just the dark blue to about $unc$three feet
and then above that we left it white
so anyway it didnt change
i see
but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
it didnt
it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic were really on to that the masking is
uh-huh
you have to do that very very carefully
and it takes a long time
thats right
you can work yourself to death
im sorry to hear your color didnt come out so good over the weekend
yeah
really
no kidding
its kind of frustrating
it is
a lot of work
a lot of work
ive got to go to a meeting
its been good talking to you
nice talking to you
okay
good-bye
bye
i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
have you been talking to males
yeah
yeah
this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female
i was afraid we might get into an argument
right
i guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for the roles of women
uh-huh
and i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities
right
they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or all sorts of other things
yeah
it seems too me like though that womens roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner than before
i think so
absolutely
i think its extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
uh-huh
sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it
but
do you work outside the home
yes
do you have children
yes
they are getting older now
uh-huh
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility
but they are still there
sure
they still take time
and i still provide most of the things that go on around the house
right
so yeah
and for a while i was going to school too
and it was tough
yeah
i think that while its a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel their expertise may be
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think sometimes other things suffer and tha-
i think its hard to find a balance there
but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all
youre almost looked down upon if you dont try to do all of these things
and thats where the problem is really
right
yeah
yeah
i have little children $unc$four and $unc$one
and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home
uh-huh
and when i happen to you know be
im very active with other people with children my age
and most of us do tend to stay home
but when i run into people that just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time theres almost a friction between us
uh-huh
uh-huh
not people that are necessarily good friends even though that has happened too
yeah
its almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence
you know w-
if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself
right
and if you dont then sometimes you feel like youre looked down upon by people that go back to work and so youre just wasting your time at home
yeah
yeah
its a tough $unc$one
ive done some of both
uh-huh
when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time
uh-huh
i think the longest was less than a year
but still at least i was able to spend those first months with them
right
but i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things
yeah
the money was the issue
but even now i would like to not have to work in some ways
right
its kind of pull and tug
yeah
on the other hand i cant imagine just being at home although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue
uh-huh
still theres sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having a job and all that goes with that
no
thats definitely true
in fact i work out of my home
im an accountant
oh
and i do taxes and bookkeeping
and i
it was
its a way for me to stay home
uh-huh
and i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at $unc$five in the morning and $unc$ten oclock at night
yeah
but its worked out for my family to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing
yeah
yeah
thats a good deal
where do you think this is going in the future
do you think things are going to change
or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this
i hope that they will change
but im
i just
i know its going to be a slow change
i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a $unc$one wage earner
im just thinking of my circle of people that i know
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both of the parents work
yeah
and yet i we-
i hope to see employer based helping out child care centers at the place of employment and things like that that will help out
uh-huh
what do you think
do you think we are setting a trend
i dont
yeah
i see some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children
uh-huh
and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work
right
but i dont know if theyre going to ever give up their careers
its sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are
i dont know if they want to completely give that up
right
its a very personal thing
but it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere
yeah
i think its hard though when you talk about families and raising children
because i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground
i think they need security
and yet they
i dont know
i
speaking from my children they arent real flexible when it comes to things like that
yeah
they want to know things are going to be a certain way
yeah
i think they like a routine of sorts
uh-huh
right
we will see
im hoping to see more female leadership in our society
yes
i like the fact that gradually youre beginning to see women in public office and executive positions
but its still a long way from being what it ought to be
yes
the numbers are still very skewed to say the least
yeah
okay
i enjoyed talking to you
okay
you too $unc$ellen
all right
good-bye
bye-bye
okay
what do you usually wear to work
i am basically retired now
uh-huh
i was a member
i was in education and in administration and heels
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
uh-huh
but that was just me
i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants
it
i guess i was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it
uh-huh
how about you
i work at $unc$t $unc$i
and they dont really have dress code so to speak there
its pretty lax about
you can pretty much wear whatever you want to
and i wear anything from jeans when im feeling really casual to suits and dresses when im meeting with a customer and so when im teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress it definitely fluctuates mainly with what im going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
oh
uh-huh
and when its raining im more likely to wear jeans
and when its really cold im more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
uh-huh
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
and then obviously when im doing anything that im in front of people or making presentations teaching whatever im going to dress up more
yes
and i think that does make a difference
because when you do have to be in front of people i think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing
uh-huh
uh-huh
what about the mini skirt
there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work
theyre pretty strict about that though
ive never worn
i just wouldnt
even to
jeans arent exactly professional
but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
maybe its just because of the sexist views and everything
but you just feel like youre showing too much le-
i dont know
i wouldnt want to wear a mini skirt to work
we-
i have seen a few people do it though
but they werent overly shor-
and they werent overly revealing
they were pretty much in good taste
but
uh-huh
for me i just wouldnt want to do that
there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts
yeah
there are some that are really short
and then there are some that may be will come like $unc$four inches or $unc$five inches above the knee
uh-huh
thats what ive seen
and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person as well as the shape of the persons legs
uh-huh
uh-huh
i also
even though i retired from education i do modeling
and i teach at a modeling agency here
uh-huh
so when we are doing wardrobing and we have $unc$two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
uh-huh
even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers in my class
uh-huh
and i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad
uh-huh
because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you
right
but the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you dont really want
right
and then youre in the situation where youre very unhappy
uh-huh
i feel like too on the job when theres men around and some of the managers are men you dont want them looking at your legs necessarily
thats right
and to me i just wouldnt feel comfortable in that at work
but
i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties
uh-huh
i
again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts
uh-huh
we had no regulation against it
and a lot of the kids did of course
and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
right
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts
right
and so i think of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont like that
i dont
i think there should be individuality in dressing
uh-huh
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have just a little something thats feminine
yes
not
you dont want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a woman
right
but i can be professional too
and i dont think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional
right
uh-huh
i think that you make of that what you wish
and you can go the opposite direction and over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which dont belong at least in my opinion in the work place
right
but that
you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine
uh-huh
because that was $unc$one thing i always fought against
i started out as a physical education teacher
uh-huh
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish
right
and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed
and that pleased me
uh-huh
and so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
and i find even at home here now i will wear blue jeans or ill wear shorts and what have you and be very comfortable
but when i go out somewhere then unless i have a pair of dress slacks i dont usually wear a lot of blue jeans
uh-huh
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how
uh-huh
and so i just feel that each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
uh-huh
but there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees
right
thats $unc$one thing i like about $unc$t $unc$i is that they arent overly strict about what you wear
and your boss doesnt come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so youd better wear a suit
they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
right
yes
the only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the split skirts anything that could be considered shorts they dont allow
yes
thats good
and they dont allow any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or anything like that on it
but other than that its pretty lax
yeah
uh-huh
and i think thats good because it does allow people to be individual
and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day
yes
or if you want to be comfortable and casual you can whereas sometimes when youre in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and maybe you cant get as comfortable to sit down
right
and when im writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
right
right
so i think that is good that theyre like that
i do know theres a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear
and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and no variation
yeah
and i dont quite agree with that
yeah
well i dont either
fortunately i dont have to work in those companies
right
but i did have a group come over from $unc$one of the banks over the childrens hospital where i was volunteering
and they were doing a presentation
and every $unc$one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie and one was a skirt and one was a pant
right
yeah
and i think thats sad because that doesnt allow for any individuality
uh-huh
that can stifle creativity
right
i agree
it
i guess weve talked probably long enough
i guess so
its been nice talking with you
nice talking to you too
i enjoyed it
uh-huh
bye bye
bye bye
okay
all right
what have you seen
the latest movie ive seen that i thought was fantastic was dances with wolves
thats
i knew you were going to say that
i want to go see that
man
i just finally ended up going to see it
and $unc$one day my husband had the kids
and i just went because we could never get to go see it together because its so long
by the time we had a babysitter for that long
gosh
so i finally just went to see it
and i just thought it was fantastic
yeah
i watched $unc$costner on the $unc$academy $unc$awards
i was really happy that he got
i was hoping he was going to get $unc$best $unc$actor
yeah
yeah
but he did pretty good on that $unc$one
that was quite a
the buffalo scene in that thing was so real
yeah
its like
it just blew me away
yeah
i bet
yeah
therere several of them that are out right now that i want to see
dances silence of the lambs
yeah
im afraid to go see that $unc$one
that $unc$one looks so scary just from the previews
i thought gosh id probably have nightmares for the next $unc$six months
nay
its supposed to be good though
nay
thats what people said
i know some friends who went to see it
yeah
they said it was really riveting
yeah
thats what they said about the exorcist
no
its terrible
youll have nightmares
i watched last weekend
me and my roommate
we laughed about it
youre not a $unc$thirteen year old
i dont know
i saw it when i was a kid
and i thought man
ill tell
i guess it was because id read the book before i saw the movie
uh-huh
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was
really
gosh
yeah
hes a very good writer
and he had a way of putting you in that scene
it was
boy
yeah
and of course i was living alone at the time
and it was late at night and scary and
you start hearing noises
gosh
call the crisis line
yeah
i bet
and theres rats in the attic
gosh
lets see
there was a couple of others that are out
and i cant remember
i saw one i thought was crummy
with that new $unc$michael $unc$j $unc$fox movie the hard way
where he plays a actor thats th-
yeah
i didnt even like the previews on that
i know
it was
i ended up at the theater
and there didnt seem to be anything else on i wanted to see
so ill try that
but it wasnt worth anything
i didnt care for that at all
no
i dont much care for $unc$michael $unc$j $unc$fox anyway
yeah
the last $unc$two i saw him in $unc$one of those back to the future part $unc$three deals
and that was crummy also
i didnt think that was any good
yeah
so
i saw the original back to the future
and then i know
i hardly ever go see a sequel
yeah
i think the only ive ever seen a sequel was $unc$two $unc$thousand and $unc$one
boy
$unc$two $unc$thousand and $unc$ten was far better
yeah
yeah
$unc$two $unc$thousand and $unc$one was a good movie if you had read the book
i hadnt read it
and i couldnt figure what was going on half the time
so
yeah
no
nobody could figure it out
the book was so much
yeah
theres just things
all you can do is put it in words
you cant put it in pictures
yeah
yeah
a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you say what is this
whats the significance of the apes
yeah
yeah
i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago
the book is really good
i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again
and thats one of them
wow
its so well written
i have $unc$one i bet you havent seen if you dont have kids $unc$otis and $unc$milo
youre right
i havent
that is the most precious movie
it has to see it on the big screen because its just the most gorgeous nature scenes youve ever seen in your life
and its all this
its the story of this little cat and dog
and its not cutesy
its just so realistic everything they do
you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things
those
and it was a real dog and cat
a real dog and cat
and all the other animals
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where theyre raised
and then the cat gets on this treacherous journey
he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river
and he winds up all over creation
i dont know where in the world it is
somewhere in $unc$china somewhere i think that it was filmed
but its just really an incredible thing
sounds sort of like the incredible journey
yeah
it was pretty wild
and of course the only sound is $unc$dudley $unc$moore narrates it
uh-huh
but theres nothing else to keep it going
but it really keeps me going
ive seen it twice now
yeah
that sounds a lot like a $unc$walt $unc$disney film
sounds a lot a like a $unc$walt $unc$disney film
yeah
it was like the best of the $unc$walt $unc$disney ones
$unc$walt disneys kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years
yeah
not anymore
i mean i was raised on $unc$walt $unc$disney films
yeah
$unc$old $unc$yeller $unc$big $unc$red
yeah
all those old good ones that you wish they had on more now
yeah
but
when i was a little kid i saw the incredible journey on $unc$christmas $unc$eve
and it was so good that i had forgotten that it was $unc$christmas $unc$eve
boy
thats something for a kid
thats pretty good
really
and that was something for greedy old me at $unc$christmas time ill tell you
lets see
what are some other ones ive seen lately
im trying to remember
i cant
i just saw $unc$one on the video
have you seen the gods must be crazy part $unc$two
no
that is a riot
is it
yeah
the first $unc$one was really good
but the second $unc$one is really good too
i was really surprised
yeah
i didnt much care for the first $unc$one
maybe thats
no
i thought it was funny
but thats my sense of humor
ill have to go get that one i guess
its hard to find movies that arent terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore
and i guess im just middle $unc$america or something
i just go to be entertained
and not really interested in the terminator or some of the $unc$schwarzenegger stuff
yeah
i just
yeah
i get so tired of these sequels
number $unc$nine number $unc$ten number $unc$fourteen
yeah
freddys revenge part $unc$twenty-five or whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
ive never
$unc$freddy eats a nuclear warhead
im just
im so sick and tired of that
i just cant believe it
its like $unc$rocky films
i havent seen a $unc$one
yeah
yeah
ive never seen any of those
i cant stand $unc$stallone
yeah
i cant either
he seems so macho i just
yeah
and i was afraid that $unc$rambo was going to do the same thing that $unc$rocky was going to do go into $unc$fourteen $unc$hundred episodes
yeah
yeah
now i hardly ever watch t v
if i ever get the hankering to see something ive got i dont know maybe about $unc$thirty or $unc$forty movies
and i just
yeah
when theyre so cheap too at the video stores that you can
yeah
i dont even rent them
you dont
i figure if i find a movie i like ill buy it
cause i just watch them over and over again
thats like
my husband does that
he can watch them over and over
yeah
i
and im
theres very few i would want to see that many times
so once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over
yeah
my very favorite $unc$one that the top of the tick for me is $unc$excalibur
yeah
that was a good $unc$one
i havent seen that $unc$one in a long time
i loved that film
its just so well done
yeah
and i lived over in $unc$england for $unc$four years
boy
that was the first place i ever saw it
uh-huh
and it was just gosh
it was so good
gosh
it was filmed in $unc$ireland
and they got pretty scenery in $unc$ireland
yeah
i bet
yeah
its nice
gosh
and ive been down to the south of $unc$england where supposedly $unc$king arthurs castle was
boy
so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
yeah
it was unimpressive to look at
the whole thing was about the size of a medium house
yeah
it wasnt
really
when i was in $unc$england years ago
and i went to shakespeares and $unc$stratford-on-avon and all that
yeah
and it was like you couldnt stand up inside of it
because it was so short
yeah
the ceilings were so short
yeah
but yeah
yeah
theres some nice stuff over there to see
yeah
i spent $unc$four years traveling around and didnt see hardly anything
i just
boy
i need to go over there and stay about $unc$twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places
yeah
$unc$stonehenge of course
everybody makes the obligatory trip to $unc$stonehenge
yeah
yeah
okay
big deal
heres some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field
okay
its boring
did you see any movies over there
i remember i went to see $unc$don $unc$quixote over there when it came out
it came out right around the time with $unc$sophia $unc$loren
and that was a riot to see that
you know something
come to think of it i dont think i went to the movies $unc$one time
yeah
cause when youre touristing you probably dont want to take the time to go see a movie
i
where i lived it was a little town called $unc$newmarket about $unc$seventy miles north of $unc$london
boy
and there was another town called barry $unc$saint $unc$edmunds about $unc$twenty miles away from us
uh-huh
and they had a little theater company there
and we use to go out to that about once a week
boy
yeah
a really nice place
amateurs but really quite good
yeah
but that was interesting
course go to $unc$london quite a lot and see shows down there
that sounds great
yeah
but other than that i just didnt have time to go to the movies
yeah
never sho- anyway anything that i ever wanted
i rented a lot of videos
uh-huh
cause the closest movie theater was barry $unc$saint $unc$edmunds
and who wants to drive $unc$twenty miles to go to the movies
boy
probably some of them did
a lot of people did
yeah
but it would have to be a good show
yeah
its hard to know what the good movies are anymore
yeah
because sometimes the reviews you just cant go by
yeah
i us-
they have all these neat phrases like critically acclaimed
yeah
thats what they when the thing hasnt won any award
i see
they cant
its kind of like waterfront property or something if youre $unc$two miles away from water
yeah
yeah
yeah
from $unc$love $unc$canal
water view
waterfront property here at $unc$love $unc$canal
yeah
but critically acclaimed
good grief
give me a break
thats wh-
theres a lot of reasons why i dont go to movies
uh-huh
and primarily now im probably going to upset you
but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
okay
were energized
okay
painting
interesting
the guy called me
when the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind
im in the middle of going out for bids to have my house painted
painting is not hard to do as long as its not to the point of where it needs to be scraped and peeling
no
right
and our house is not
but its starting to bleed through and burn through because the paints real cheap
and its just a hassle to go through it
so im looking for the easy way out
yeah
i know
di-
is easy to find painters to do this for you
its easier to find painters
but you have to be aware of how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good $unc$two coats and are they going to caulk
ri-
are you talking outside or inside
exterior
exterior
yeah
yeah
interiors not so bad because its more fun
its more c-
but yeah
yeah
outside you have high peeks and those kind of things
yeah
it can be a real issue
when weve painted
right now our house doesnt have to have the same kind of exterior painting there
its more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles on the back and theres some sort of stone or something in the front
uh-huh
so there isnt as much wood that has to be painted
but it
the problem is that the sun hits it
so preparing is a real problem
uh-huh
youve got to prepare it well
or else it will flake
uh-huh
here they
some of the home builders are
they dont put brick on the side of your house just to save money
so they put up a quarter inch $unc$masonite basically
and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts
so its real cheap
and ive had $unc$thirteen $unc$hundred dollar bid and as low as $unc$five $unc$hundred and $unc$forty dollars
so its just a matter of
wow thats quite a range
its
there $unc$one guy brags about his piece of equipment hes using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
and im so much worried about that as what i dont want it all over the brick and windows
yeah
and
yeah
which might be a bigger problem than it would be
sure
yeah
absolutely
so you havent had any jobs painted in your house recently
no
we have done a little painting ourselves
we painted the bedroom well within the last couple of months
thats fun
and we have some more that need to be done
uh-huh
but the problem that weve owned this house almost $unc$five years now
and when we bought it it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired
but the daughter was a real estate agent
and she was selling it
and its been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house
so she told us that the house had been professionally painted recently
and it looked pretty good the interior walls all basically white
but they obviously had been done without to much wear afterward
the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the door frames
uh-huh
when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it
thats not very
big long strips
so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly
and some of still has to be redone
they just painted over varnished wood
yeah
my
no
actually it had been a repaint job
but they had not
either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top
or they hadnt really roughed it up or whatever because it was woodwork
so it looked as if it had been painted correctly with an enamel or something
uh-huh
either that or it had not been prepared underneath
and it was greasy or something
sure
it comes off in strips not even little bit
so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time
no
we know what a job its going to be
because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order to do it again
i wish you good luck
okay
thank you very much
thank you
bye-bye
bye
how do you feel about our policy in $unc$latin $unc$america
im all in favor of it
yeah
no
i think weve been doing a pretty good job not taking advantage of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us
we could direct the government even more than we have been
i dont think weve been doing too bad
yeah
do you think thats right
do you think we should direct the government
i think as a whole that being that the drug industry can bring so much money to a country
i think that if it wasnt for the $unc$united $unc$states $unc$government matching that the drug cartels or whatever would control most the $unc$central and $unc$latin $unc$america
yeah
just that money is power
yeah
and
i have a friend his descendants are from $unc$nicaragua and very
its like his mother came over
uh-huh
and he
i just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about our intervention and their government and stuff like that
uh-huh
and he was all for it because its just like you say
theres so many people there that get the kind of control thats bad
uh-huh
and that their governments can become so corrupt
and its like i use to feel like
they should work their way
they should be able to work their self out of it
or why intervene in another countrys problems and things like that
why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that
but i think just a lot of times if we dont then that influence will affect our country too for $unc$one
and for $unc$two that it does help
i think the people in those country do want our help the people that are under conditions that are not favorable to their rights
right
exactly
yeah
yeah
but
but i wish we didnt have to
id rather
even if a country chooses a government thats not exactly the kind of government that we have or as in complete opposition to it at least its their choice as long its one that makes since so to speak
it is a government that stays in power that can stay in power
but it seems like most of them dont
yeah
sometimes thats $unc$america doing that too
yeah
we fall out of agreements with certain leaders
and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader
its
so you think $unc$c $unc$i $unc$a influence and our money over there
that and
yeah
$unc$america starts talking then about removing bases and whatnot and stuff like that and people
yeah
or government aids and stuff
right
yeah
i think that has a lot of things to did with
then how can you say in $unc$europe as far as the toppling of those kinds of governments
yeah
that was
im really wondering whether thats going it settle down or not
because on $unc$one hand you have the soviet government of course mistreating a lot of the slovak countries and then on the other hand you have
uh-huh
they were feeding us
so i dont know really whats going to happen
yeah
but were not intervening in that
or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing
oh
are
yeah
i think were getting quite a
put it this way i think
no
i think the people are revolting themselves
and
yeah
and were allowing it to happen
i agree with that
yeah
yeah
i agree that communication has become so much more widespread and worldwide that people are realizing hey we dont have it so good and lets stand up
right
this is ridiculous
were living with these kind of conditions in a world thats advancing as fast as it is
uh-huh
that
i think people are just saying no way we dont want anywhere of this
yeah
i think $unc$central $unc$america has always been one of those places where people are more passive where its always the minority that are trying to make the country better
yeah
yeah
i dont mean to
i guess i do in a way
sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that
i think that because of those countries where such $unc$catholic influence
and i think the $unc$catholic religion itself was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down so to speak
i thought it was the other way around
but
they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this
so all the persecution that theyre sort of use to it its been sort of
but i dont agree with that because the catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak
they are the ones that set a lot of the rules
and they are the ones that do keep the people down
when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they dont understand when anything is being said yet theyre expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in sort of line
i dont quite understand that
do they even understand whats being said
when it use to be latin
im just saying that the old church
yeah
the old church
yeah
yeah
which its not that way now
but i think that its just latin countries are slower in coming around
they actually understood
it is in $unc$america where it was hard
latin is very very very close to spanish
latin
they still didnt understand it though i dont think
yeah
because i descend from that
and i dont understand latin
yeah
and im of spanish descent
so i just think that has something to do with why $unc$latinos tend to be the more meek
they tend to be more
not stand up for their rights as much
theyre not really sure of what they are i dont think
i never really thought of it that way
how can you contrast the $unc$europeans and their vocalism on their rights to say the people in $unc$latin $unc$america
why are they not as vocal
or why do they not stand up so to speak for their rights
i dont know
could be the economic still
the
theres
the poverty level is certainly much worse in the latin american countries
you can say that about $unc$africa too
i think it has something to do with the poverty level because $unc$africa is certainly not a $unc$catholic country
uh-huh
and yet they have the same problem where kings and such
i dont agree with that
i dont agree
because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in $unc$africa
i think theyve made a lot more chances
their very vocal
in $unc$south $unc$africa
yeah
in $unc$south $unc$africa i think they are
but yet
so whats the difference
$unc$idi $unc$amin was in power for so long
yeah
racial i think
or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other english colonies or previous english colonies everything is equal and yet down there its not
yeah
i think communication does have a lot to do with it in education maybe
yeah
i dont know about education
because the black community is still not very educated down there
so i think it is communication
its just oopsy
i think it maybe has a lot to do with education
because you look at the european countries
i think they tend to be more educated much more educated than $unc$africa or the latin american countries
uh-huh
yeah
thats true
you know that
i dont know whether
actually ive always wondered how the education system works in the russian countries the republics
uh-huh
i know that $unc$russia theyre comparably better educated than we are in our country
really
thats good in a way
something we compete with
yeah
and ive been sort of disappointed that they say literacy rate has gone down
thats sort of upsetting to think that were richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer
yeah
in our country
in our country
yeah
yeah
that is really upsetting
and considering its free
good education is really still free
yeah
thats just it though good education
uh-huh
is it good education
it may be free but is it good education
and thats just it
are we willing to pay for it
yeah
uh-huh
a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all
but are they willing to pay for quality education
uh-huh
and yet people get very frightened when they see the $unc$japanese moving in and the $unc$russians moving in certain areas of technology that we use to dominate
and its like theyre educating their people to higher degrees than we do
so youre going to have to expect it
so what you
are you willing to compromise a little and take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education
so i dont know
but i
okay
who is your favorite football team
guess
i bet you cant guess
i would say the $unc$saints since
you got it
and i want to tell you something
whats that
theyre going to go somewhere pretty shortly
yeah
yeah
i think they are because theyre getting better every year
yeah
and they got a lot
cant call them the $unc$new $unc$orleans $unc$aints any more
i dont think so
no
we went to the playoffs
yeah
yeah
im a $unc$buffalo $unc$bills fan from a long time ago
yeah
now i like them too
so its good to see the $unc$bills doing so well now
and
they are
they are doing a whole bunch better
whos their quarterback
yeah
whats that
whos their quarterback
$unc$jim $unc$kelly
yeah
yeah
i like to watch them too
theyre the
i like to watch almost all the football
but of course i watch every $unc$saints game that i can watch
uh-huh
but i think theyre really going to do good because it seems like theyre finally all coming together
yeah
if they would just quit blowing it
the
it
the $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l draft really seems to be doing its job
because got teams like $unc$buffalo who certainly werent a powerhouse $unc$ten years ago
now theyve been able to get some good players and come around
and th-
$unc$new $unc$orleans the same story
and a few years ago $unc$denver was a powerhouse
and then they werent getting the draft picks
and now the other team
so it seems to be moving around to $unc$new orleans benefit
yeah
and you see how
look at the $unc$cowboys now and
uh-huh
really bad
yeah
but they got so much bad publicity too
and i think that hurt a lot of people even wanting to play on their team
w-
yeah
yeah
firing $unc$tom $unc$landry and hiring $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson
what kind of
doesnt give you much respect for their team at all
any team where the owner would fire $unc$tom $unc$landry is one of the greatest coaches of all time
right
right
and just because they had a couple of bad seasons
and you cant even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
yeah
yeah
because all the problems
if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad
his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of messing with young children
right
and it was just $unc$one thing it seemed like right after the other with them
right
and he alway-
and had a lot of trouble with injuries too
yeah
hed never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy
and then even like what is it $unc$eric $unc$dickerson left the team
uh-huh
tha-
youre right
people were jumping ship right and left
right
and i dont know
that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem
but then the team was sold
yeah
so
but that $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson came in too though
and he just
when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided this is the way its going to be
and it was bad
yeah
it really was
to me it was like its going to take them quite a while to rebuild
because anything that $unc$tom $unc$landry wanted or had he was going to change it
right
i mean its
thats the way i felt about it
but i tell you what
yeah
if $unc$new $unc$orleans ever gets a quarterback isnt nobody going to beat us
there aint nobody going to beat us then
because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
i know
who was the quarterback
they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it
i cant even think of who the $unc$new $unc$orleans quarterback is
$unc$fourcade was for a while
and then i cant remember that guys name the $unc$one that held out for the money
and he was across the river
i cant think of his name now
but really we didnt have a quarterback
that was the whole problem
yeah
we had $unc$one guy that couldnt throw
and we had $unc$one guy that couldnt run
and it was just bedlam
we really didnt have a quarterback
it was defense won all the games
were they able to draft anybody this year
i dont know
because they gave away a lot of their drafts for different people for other places
uh-huh
right
so i dont know
i hadnt heard whether they have a new $unc$one or not
when is the $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l draft
but
has the $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l draft even gone yet
uh-huh
not yet
but i dont know whether they have $unc$one of the first choices of somebody
right
right
that would be real good
theyve
yeah
theyve
ye-
everybody gets in draft
sure
but i dont know whether theyll be far enough up where they can do any good
right
but
or even making the playoffs
so that doesnt help you in the draft
right
but really and truly we just dont have a quarterback
yeah
yeah
thats all there is to it
but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too
uh-huh
because we had some
you remember when $unc$archie $unc$manning was a quarterback
that was a few years ago
yeah
he was good
but every time wed get a real good player theyd treat him bad
uh-huh
and of course we had a different coach then too
but theyd treat him bad or either theyd trade him off to somebody else for $unc$two of these nobodies
uh-huh
right
and it was weird
it was like they were trying if you were good boy lets dont have you on our team
but this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
yeah
the quarterback all of them every $unc$one that they played
i think they played
i cant remember whether we played $unc$three or $unc$four quarterbacks
but all of them were bad
they were terrible
they could not pitch
they couldnt even take handoffs
it was terrible
right
but all the other places our defense was unbelievable
its $unc$one thing
yeah
buffalos lucky though to have $unc$jim $unc$kelly than
did you get to watch any of their games
now hes the number $unc$one rated quarterback in the $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l i think
yeah
im pretty sure he was this past season
and then with the defense with $unc$bruce $unc$smith there at linebacker there theyve got a very well rounded team
and it seems that theyve gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past
and now theyre really playing good together as a team
yeah
do you watch it every $unc$sunday
when i can
im a musician
and the band i play in i
this is just something on the side
and the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on $unc$sundays
so i missed a lot of $unc$sundays during this
did you ever get to watch any of the $unc$new $unc$orleans games
ac-
id have to confess i dont really scope out the $unc$new $unc$orleans games $unc$per $unc$se
$unc$new $unc$orleans just isnt $unc$one of the areas
ive lived in so many places
ive lived in $unc$denver
but i dont like the $unc$broncos
theres no love for the $unc$broncos
but ive lived in
no
i was born in $unc$buffalo
and i lived outside of $unc$boston for $unc$five years
and then my family lives in $unc$philadelphia now
so i tend to look for
teams in your area
and i lived in $unc$detroit too
so i
first of all first and foremost the $unc$bills games i want to see
and then ill normally check out the $unc$eagles or the $unc$patriots
and $unc$patriots were so depressing this last year that i kind of gave up on them
i know it
yeah
yeah
but first and foremost the $unc$bills
i even wen-
i got to go to a $unc$bills game this year which was fun
it was the $unc$bills $unc$eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the $unc$bills won
oh
thats neat
yeah
and it was good weather
yes
we beat $unc$buffalo in was it third of $unc$december
and it was sunny and $unc$forty-five degrees
my goodness
so we couldnt a done much better than that in $unc$buffalo
no
because usually its snowing
yeah
ice and rain and everything
sure
but i tell you what
if you get to watch some of these
i dont know how it will be this year
but these games go right down to the wire
uh-huh
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair going no no
and $unc$one
i cant remember
it was about
it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs or not
uh-huh
so were watching the game
all right
the other team got the ball
and we got the ball back
thats the way it was
and they had to kick to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got $unc$one point ahead of us
uh-huh
so we had to sit there
and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game
we did not get to see the end of the game
you talk about people calling in
my gosh
it was wild
here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair
sure
and then they changed the game
and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another one that was going on
right
cut us off right there the last few seconds
the station finally you know how theyll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national
right
right
it was the network
uh-huh
because it was funny
everybody was furious
i was so mad i got up and went and called
i couldnt believe that
but almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end
we would be ahead
but then in the fourth quarter theyd let them get up there either with them or right ahead of them
right
and itd come right down to the end
and either we made it or we didnt
and it was something else
i said this is the most
if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the $unc$super $unc$bowl
yeah
theres no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks
and the quarterbacks just didnt do anything
yeah
thats the guy that counts
yes
but maybe well get your guy
i dont think $unc$jim $unc$kelly is about to be swayed away from the $unc$bills any time
so do you have a personal computer
we do have $unc$one in our home
its on the fritz right now because the monitor isnt working properly
but it has been used tremendously mostly by my children for playing games
oh
however the bane of our existence these days
but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports and papers and that sort of thing
yeah
thats what
when this subject was mentioned to us i went gee thats all i use mine for is a word processor
and i havent used it since i got out of college
and that was $unc$six years ago
wow
but it was my sisters who
my sister bought it
uh-huh
and my father had a small business
and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business
and he never did
oh
he always did everything out by hand
he only had $unc$three employees
yeah
so it wasnt really worth it to him to do it
yeah
actually it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand
yeah
like pay the payroll
and
exactly
and there are lots of them on the market
yeah
basically payroll
yeah
but you do have to research that find out what works for your system
what kind do you have
its an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
i think its a $unc$professional $unc$three $unc$hundred
no
thats the digital $unc$one
its an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$p $unc$c $unc$junior i think
thats a nice computer
yeah
she uses it now my sister to
actually she moved she took it with her because she needed it to do
uh-huh
so she took it with her
yeah
dont blame her
she just finished up her bachelors degree
uh-huh
so i dont know if shes going to even use it anymore
its
yeah
encourage her to try other things
because i am
i work in a school system
and i teach writing
and we use the computers a great deal for word processing because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself
yeah
but i also am sponsoring a literary magazine
and were doing our entire layout on the computer because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program
yeah
thats neat
thats a very good use
so it is wonderful
once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them that you dont do until you really make yourself use them
yeah
i know theres got to be a lot of uses
but its just you have to have a need
you have to make yourself do it
yeah
yeah
but you have to have a need
i really have no need for it at all
yeah
i work for $unc$digital $unc$equipment
uh-huh
and we have a powerful computer down at work
oh
so you dont need a personal $unc$one
no
and i still really dont do that much as you say play games on it
yeah
yeah
yeah
theyre great for playing games
right
my brother
my son is studying electronic technology
and hes been able to do things on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way
yeah
and i guess it
if youre doing that sort of thing its really useful
but unless it is i guess its kind of a waste
i know some people they just went through a course and took the electronic grafting course drafting not grafting but drafting course
thats fascinating
uh-huh
yeah
the $unc$c $unc$a $unc$d
i knew what you meant
yeah
yeah
and thats really neat
yeah
you can do graphs on it too
yeah
but this is $unc$one step above it
but its actual drafting
yeah
and i always
yes
you can do wonderful design
its really s-
especially when anyone whos ever done any kind of drafting or engineering drawing
you have to be so precise
yeah
and the computer does it all for you
yeah
so it was really neat
i wanted to go to that course
but my boss wouldnt pay for it
im like ill get a job some day and my boss will pay for it
ill be needed
yeah
because i didnt want to go do it myself
because i didnt think i was really going to use it
uh-huh
i got this cough
ive got a cold because it was $unc$eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on
boy
yeah
it was bad
what a change huh
yes
was a big change
yeah
you couldnt really wear a coat because it was so hot
and then again i picked up a cold
right
but im doing all right getting over it
thats good
so i dont even know how much personal computers cost nowadays
they vary tremendously
because you can get
because theyre
the ones that were made a few years ago have come down in price significantly
ive seen them for $unc$five and $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars
but they have much less memory and capable of much less
yeah
they cant do your drafting and your graphs and all of that
no
you cant do very much on them
right
right
its just that you have to be able to get your program in
and many of the programs are so big
they take up so much space that you dont have any place then to work
you dont have any bytes left
yeah
but if you want to go into one thats really useful youre going to have to go over a $unc$thousand dollars
and even for a personal computer its probably smart to spend that much
and weve
ours is not quite that powerful
and so we are limited which may be $unc$one reason why
you do run into limitations on yours
yeah
wow
uh-huh
some things we cant do
but then we havent needed to either
yeah
but weve been able to do what we can
wow thats neat that you even reach the limits of yours
i havent even begun to reach the limits
no
but i
mine is not as good as a p c junior
junior
yeah
yeah
yeah
ours is a $unc$commodore $unc$one $unc$twenty-eight
yeah
and its not quite as useful not quite as powerful
yeah
they say that $unc$commodore has made a good p c for the price though
so
they did
yeah
thats very true
thats very true
they did
very competitive
i dont even know much money my sister spent on hers
but i just thought its going to be a waste
shes not going to use it
sounds that you were right
yeah
she likes it
she gets to write her reports
but like i say she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted
yeah
and she could have bought a typewriter also
yeah
a typewriter with memory would have been fine
yeah
its all she uses it for
yeah
i think it might have a spelling editor on it
im not sure yeah
yeah
it
yeah
it prob-
if it doesnt she could easily put it on
yeah
yeah
right
thats the $unc$one great thing about it
right
which program did you use
did you use $unc$word $unc$perfect
no
i really dont
it was $unc$six years ago
yeah
she pretty much set it up
she goes here you make your file and then you can edit it
right
i used the $unc$one at work a lot
matter of fact anything ive had to write from now on i had to ca-
$unc$god forbid
write a couple of resumes
and i was just great
and all you have to do is just put it in the spelling check mode
uh-huh
and i dont even have to look my words up anymore
yeah
theyre great
youre right
i guess weve spent our time
oh
i need to go help my daughter do something
so this has been fun talking to you
okay
good
okay
good luck
yeah
bye
bye-bye
do you think
i wonder
the assumption is that it is a problem
and ive never actually had too many people explain to me why its a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that its a problem
but its not clear to me that it is
bo-
its a problem if those voting dont represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions
but if those who dont vote if you made them vote
and it those who dont vote would have voted exactly the same way in other words if $unc$forty percent had voted for that person and $unc$sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote its not clear to me that it is really a problem
thats interesting
because i had thought
i feel that its a problem also
but i see your point on that
i assume that those who dont vote
if you look at the break down of those who dont vote they tend to be
poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that
and i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter
but i dont know if thats the case
in fact ive heard of studies that suggest that that isnt
apparently they dont think its a problem
i guess not
i vote religiously
i really do
i guess im a fan of democracy
and wish i could vote on more things frankly
thats right
but its funny because here in $unc$california things are getting increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things
we have these state initiatives now
oh
the first really wide spread $unc$one was $unc$proposition $unc$thirteen which was a tax revolt against property taxes
right
i r-
and now were
and that was whatever $unc$ten years ago
and now were up to $unc$proposition a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty or something like that
weve just
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have $unc$three different competing proposals
and you had to vote for yes or no on each of them
and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult
and a lot of people revolted against that
they said we dont want to have to decide all these things
thats why we hire people to make these decisions for us
i kind of feel the opposite though
yeah
i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things
i do t-
i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us
but theyre not speaking for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i wouldnt mind having more votes than i get to have frankly
thats true
anyone who doesnt vote its fine with me as long as i can have their vote
that would make me happy though
maybe not in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would
i dont know
its interesting some countries voting is obligatory
it is in $unc$australia for example
is that true
yeah
yeah
i didnt know that
i was think-
that is $unc$one solution to it
i dont know how i feel about that
but i dont
thats not really democratic not what id consider truly democratic
$unc$australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the $unc$united $unc$states
as
uh-huh
and its not for me to say that theyre not
uh-huh
they feel
here you have the right to vote
and they simply define it as a duty there
just as we have a duty to pay taxes
is that democratic
we dont have the right to pay taxes in this country
we have the duty to pay taxes
its a duty right
and in that country its a duty to pay taxes
and its a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent
and its not clear to me that thats so much less democratic
i dont know
uh-huh
but part of me rebels against that
its complex question when you start thinking about it isnt it
but then im an $unc$american
yeah
and some people dont vote
there is
like $unc$three or $unc$four percent of $unc$australians dont vote
and i think theyre eligible for a fine
i dont know if they actually are fined or what happens
but youre eligible for some sort of fine if you dont vote
uh-huh
thats interesting
i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote
uh-huh
and i think they feel they can criticize if they dont
yeah
i was sort of s-
i told them if they dont vote they dont have the right to criticize
i
thats how i feel
if you vote and your guy looses you least tried
and you can say something
but if you dont vote part of me and its kind of a nasty part of me feels like if you didnt vote you get whats coming to you
thats right
i feel th-
and certainly thats true in the overall
no $unc$one individual thats true for but for the population as a whole
i sort of feel that way especially when they dont vote for someone because they dont like any of them and then the person gets in and they dont like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that
and i say voting for the lesser of $unc$two evils is still important
i think it is too
sometimes it is a difficult choice
you dont feel as though you have much of a choice
but
yeah
yeah
its funny because technically you do
you have the right to do a write in candidate
but of course thats not really a vote
it doesnt really gain anything
yes
it really doesnt
and so its a complicated situation
but i would like to see
i dont know
im thinking of actually moving to $unc$australia
and perhaps ill call you back and let you know how the australian system works
is that goin-
im not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity
not be-
i see
and i
are you a $unc$t $unc$i employee im interested
no
im not
not
okay
i just wondered
so im really quite curious how that would work to have both
and i believe in a certain
soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too
in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently
and thats what i think of when i think of youre obliged to vote
but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its $unc$two party system
i dont know
i kind of
part of me is wary
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
maybe they should
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first $unc$three or $unc$four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for $unc$four years
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats a thought
or certain privileges come from voting which arent that important but are nice to have
i dont know
the right to write your
maybe it should go with a drivers license
yeah
thats an example of a right not a
actually
thats considered a privilege not a right
that is a privilege
right
tha-
yeah
but technically most people
technically its a privilege
but most people think of it as a right
in other words if the government denies you a drivers license people get very upset
but actually its a privilege which is allowed to be revoked
it is
thats correct
and fortunately voting isnt that
maybe it should be
except if youre a felon
if youre a felon it is taken away from you
uh-huh
they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
thats right
so gosh
so we dont have a great solution yet do we
dont have a great
i think i checked that as a question id be willing to discuss too
oh
but i dont know if youve read any of the early republic documents when they were arguing through constitutional law written by $unc$hamilton and all those people
no
no
i havent
i think it was $unc$hamilton who wrote number $unc$ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the $unc$republican $unc$party now versus a democratic government and arguing successfully why the $unc$united $unc$states should be a republic not a democracy which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy
right
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues
in other words you vote for representatives
uh-huh
and the whole idea was presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
and he makes a very passionate good argument for why you dont want some things decided by democratic process
because anytime you have a majority they can change the law in a fully democratic process
and there are cases when you dont want that to be the case
a candi-
if theres some minority that people dont like because of racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote against them
right
and cases like that he argues need to be constrained
and actually i agree except that i dont trust the people who are appointed to vote
sometimes i think we have that right now with $unc$congress
yeah
i feel that wa-
i think theyre looking after their own self preservation more than theyre actually looking after the good of the country
yeah
their job is to be reelected by in large
and so they work on that job
and theres also an antigovernment mood in the country where government is misspending your dollars
and theyre all fools
and throw the bastards out
that kind of thing
right
and theres a notion that somehow if someone isnt as much as a government person theyre less corrupt and theyre more likely to be good which is really strange
because if im hiring a plumber i want a real plumber
i want someone trained in
what do you think about the metric system
do you find it useable
have you tried much with it
with an engineering degree of course its a whole lot easier
yeah
uh-huh
because
to use you mean
uh-huh
yeah
if somebody is totally unfamiliar with it human nature being what it is we dont like to change
yes
it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because its all decimal
yes
and its so easy to convert from $unc$one set of units to another
uh-huh
uh-huh
we
well ive lived both in the $unc$united $unc$states and in a country where they do use the metric system
so ive lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over
the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilograms
right
thats right
and i think thats what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is $unc$two point $unc$fifty-four centimeters
right
how on earth am i every going to do the math
right
and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and leaving it at that
and a kilogram weighs about this much
and get used to it from scratch
cause i still cant convert back and forth from inches to centimeters
but im perfectly comfortable using either
uh-huh
and i think the real problem with this weird conversion you see signs that say $unc$fifty-five miles per hour and whatever it would be $unc$one $unc$hundred $unc$six kilometers per hour
people
its hard to take it seriously
yeah
and as long as both were given you basically just dont read the kilometers per hour
you just say look read the miles per hour one
the other one must be for someone else
thats right
i dont know
i mean even $unc$britain has converted over
and we inherited this mess from them
and
thats right
its all their fault
its more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light
i dont know why they were more able than we were
except i think that they probably just said were just going to start using the things now
and you sort of have to force people to change since they dont want to
of course being part of the european community if everybody else did it they were probably much more
is much more necessary for them than for us
thats true
thats probably true
and $unc$america does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting some other model
theres an expression for that
with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future
ive never heard that one
thats very nice
so im all for the metric system and converting over
and i think
i guess my feeling is the way to do it is to just start giving weights have a very brief transition period and then just start giving just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert
remember me getting a package of something that said $unc$one pound
this is a package of dates mind you
was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely
it said $unc$one pound
and then in parenthesis it said $unc$four $unc$hundred fifty-four point $unc$six grams
right
right
and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda
cause anyone who would say look i can either buy a pound of something at $unc$four $unc$hundred sixty-four point $unc$six grams which of course they couldnt weigh it out accurately anyway
every time i see something like that i think thats an anti-metric argument
yeah
i dont think it could ever happen with a quick transition
you dont
no
i think that would be the easiest way
but human nature being such as it is i would think it would take probably $unc$two or $unc$three years before people could completely cut the cord
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
thats what i was thinking by quick transition
i didnt mean like $unc$sweden going over to right hand drive or anything
at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything
did they switch
i believe so
yeah
and i think they did it overnight
cause you cant do it gradually
thats an example of something you cant do gradually
thats true
it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
yes
it does
a quantum leap from left to right hand drive
interesting
and they
but that must have taken
that was something that had to be done quickly because of external circumstances
yes
but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with or the rest of continental $unc$europe
yeah
but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate
yeah
im sure
so i think its essential that its done
and i think the real trick is to avoid the
a little more attention to human psychology
and whereas people want round numbers
and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they dont deal with $unc$thirty seconds of an inch
exactly
exactly
and so what the exact
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented
really i think
we do have the $unc$two liter soda pop bottles
uh-huh
i saw that
i saw that the other day
i dont drink soda pop
yeah
but i saw a $unc$two liter soda pop bottle
so yeah
things like that are a good start
and if you start expressing $unc$one liters and $unc$one kilograms and then the pounds come in the odd numbers $unc$two point $unc$two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible $unc$one
right
yes
thats true
sure have enjoyed our talk
yes
get back to what youre doing
and ill do the same
i enjoyed talking with you too
okay
$unc$god bless y-
bye-bye
okay
bye-bye
do you exercise a lot
its scaled back considerably
right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike
but i just $unc$nine months ago got married and bought a house
so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot
is mowing the lawn a new exercise
yeah
lawn
its a $unc$forty year old house
so we are doing a lot of refurbish work
my
and yeah
painting lawn gutters
you name it all kinds of stuff flower beds
i think thats considered exercise whether you want it or not
yeah
thats true
thats true
theres always something to do
and it keeps me going
you are so far ahead of me
i used to walk $unc$two miles a day
uh-huh
and i really enjoyed it
yeah
because the $unc$two miles went fairly quickly
i could do it in $unc$twenty-eight minutes
yeah
and thats not stopping and talking to everyone along the way
right
but its a lot
its not too strenuous
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything
but i dont know what i did to my knee
i was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
uh-huh
and i mashed it wrong or i did something
gosh
and the doctor has had me on medication
and she doesnt want me to walk
she said thats while its healing youre going to mess it up
so i cant walk
wow
and she said the most conservative approach you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery
uh-huh
and i dont want her to think of surgery on my knee
i dont want anyone to think about that ever
no
thats a tough situation
thats that microscopic stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
not my kneecap
so im being very good
yeah
but i miss it
i really do
and i
that
its so aggravating to have an injury like that
my wife likes to run
but shes
we moved down to the north end of $unc$oak $unc$cliff in the $unc$castle $unc$park area
really
yeah
and she started running down there and all the hills
uh-huh
and she lasted about $unc$two weeks
and her ankles couldnt take it anymore
she was used to running flat tracks and whatnot
and ever since that its just been real difficult
its real aggravating because she starts in
and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground
so shes kind of in the same mode
she was all ready to get back into it and start running $unc$five ks and $unc$ten ks and stuff this spring
and she just hasnt been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
and when you want to do it its really really aggravating
its $unc$one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise
and its another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health
can you understand that
yeah
i dont really want to
i just know i need to
i make myself do it
and if i do it okay
i dont love it
but i will do it
sure
its not anything i would want to
but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do
yeah
yeah
its depressing
uh-huh
it is
and you dont spi-
speaking for myself i dont sleep as well when i am not exercising
and its harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff
your body just gets used to it
yeah
i dont particularly enjoy it
i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that
i do enjoy riding bike
but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that i cant say i really enjoyed it all that much
but once i got used to it it was habit forming
it was
i felt so bad if i didnt
physically i mean
i just
my body was tuned into that mode
and if i skipped it then it kind of threw the whole system out of whack
right
yeah
right
boy
hopefully my knee is a $unc$hundred percent better
maybe i can get back into it
yeah
thats for sure
let me ask you a question off the subject though
okay
youre living in the $unc$castle $unc$park area
thats right
i grew up in $unc$oak $unc$cliff
did you really
yes
i did
just close to $unc$methodist $unc$hospital
okay
yeah
on $unc$candy
$unc$c $unc$a $unc$n $unc$d $unc$y
right
in fact i lived there until late $unc$nineteen fifties
okay
okay
and that area is it changing back again
so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
yeah
it is
were on a little street called $unc$bison $unc$trail
its only about a block and a half long
but its over on the other end
its over by the far edge of stephens $unc$park $unc$golf $unc$course
i know exactly where that is
yeah
its
you know where the little bridge is on $unc$north $unc$oak $unc$cliff $unc$boulevard
yeah
sure
yeah
we are just south of that little bridge back-up on the hill in the trees there
and yeah
our street is an awful lot of retired people
but the other half
in fact our $unc$one little block and a half there $unc$four houses sold last summer
and $unc$three sold the summer before
and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again
and everybody is real excited
thats wonderful
yeah
that is a gorgeous gorgeous place
its a lot of fun
the people are great
there too weve got a real active neighborhood association
and weve got $unc$four regular parties every year
and we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff
so its a lot of fun
and its a really beautiful area
and some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses
and theyre getting them at a real bargain
they are
you know
theyre getting $unc$four $unc$thousand square feet for a $unc$hundred $unc$fifty a $unc$hundred and $unc$seventy-five $unc$thousand dollars
and theyre just going to town with them
people are putting in pools and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original $unc$nineteen $unc$thirty $unc$nineteen forties look
wow
and its really coming around
i
i need to go over there and just drive around and look
its worth the trip
im sure it must be
im just
we had a lovely little house over there
it was a $unc$two story
uh-huh
story and a half really because we had a basement
okay
and the guy that built it was weird
i mean weird
yeah
its one of these really creative houses that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else
okay
wow
and i just loved the neighborhood
yeah
and everyone had houses like that
they were all completely different
uh-huh
thats right
and so neat
yeah
ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big i guess its $unc$twenty-eight by $unc$fifteen front porch
oh
next door weve got an $unc$austin stone
across the street the guy
it was burnt out about $unc$two years ago
and the guy moved in and completely redid
its got a rounded front on it
its all brick
and hes landscaped his yard
and hes about ready to put in a pool and things like that
so yeah
theres a variety
you just dont see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot
why couldnt your wife run around the golf course
is that not good
she could a little bit
we
i tell you what
we got into the fitness center at $unc$methodist
and they have a quarter mile track there
so she has started doing that rather than take off
the problem is shes a school teacher
and for her she cant run in the morning
for her to get home and try to run at $unc$six oclock in the night in the winter time its starting to get dark
and you dont want to
she doesnt want to be out by herself anywhere in $unc$dallas
regardless whether its north $unc$dallas or whatnot when she goes over to this fitness center its fenced in
and theres somebody in the building watching her and all that
so theres a lot of consideration
yes
i really hear that
i think youre in $unc$oak $unc$cliff
uh-huh
but im in $unc$plano
in west $unc$plano
yeah
and we live on $unc$one of those blocks that its a neighborhood watch block
uh-huh
we all know each other
and the street doesnt go anywhere
right
if you are on the street you better belong there because its not a through street
thats right
thats right
and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business
uh-huh
and my husband had a lot of heartburn with that
yeah
it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on
right
when i was out walking it was more of a predawn type
pretty but
huh-huh
he didnt think it looked predawn to him
yeah
it looked dark
yeah
and even he was real concerned about that
so its not just because you are in $unc$oak $unc$cliff
its just because youre smart
thats true
that you dont do things like that
it only takes $unc$one time
thats right
its a hard lesson to learn
theres only one crazy out there to make any difference
yeah
yeah
it goes all over
you got the
ready to talk
i guess so
okay
okay
i want to talk about our family budget and the times that its worked and the times that it hasnt worked and give you a general description of it
okay
yeah
bit
tell me how yours works
at the my-
i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that were on the east coast now
uh-huh
my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that
we both decided we wanted to move to $unc$north $unc$carolina
uh-huh
and so naturally we put ourselves
we looked at our budget
yeah
and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic
uh-huh
and so we had to make some adjustments
because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do thats satisfactory
and weve been here $unc$seven months
and hes still hasnt hit up on anything permanently
no
so you see
that throws the budget out of whack real fast
we actually planned for about $unc$one year
good
that $unc$god because it never occurred to us that it would take $unc$seven months
really
that was smart
yeah
and what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before
uh-huh
and then we put that on the computer
and then we took about $unc$three months and adjusted where we could come down and where we didnt want to come down
uh-huh
yeah
and we really lessened our living expenses more than what we thought we would
wow thats great
but
did you have a special program on your computer to do that
or was this just your own design of
just our own design
uh-huh
uh-huh
gosh
and the
but weve had budgets that didnt work when our
of
our first $unc$fifteen years or $unc$eighteen years of being married nothing worked
yeah
we spent too much money until our children went to college
so tell me about
yeah
do you all have a budget
weve been married for $unc$five and a half years
and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of things and did really have a real strict budget
but the
about and
to our
when we first got married we were in graduate school
and we were just dirt poor
then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided wed bank my salary so we could buy a house
so we virtually did that for about $unc$two years which worked real well and then moved from $unc$california where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved and moved to $unc$texas bought a house immediately which of course is now devalued with the housing market
wonderful
yes
so i dont know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not
but at least weve got a place to live
so now since we have a $unc$three year old and a $unc$two year old now
$unc$three and a $unc$two year old
uh-huh
bang
bang
that threw our budget really out of whack too
an we have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids
and we just really have
i dont know
weve tried different times
weve done a survey of taking the past $unc$three months of where all the money went
uh-huh
and we really dont spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all
but it seems like theres times when we just have to get out where well go and get a baby-sitter and well go and well blow $unc$fifty $unc$sixty dollars in $unc$one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something
i think thats important for your budget to be realis-
for it to work though you have to do something
yeah
thats the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week
and then its not really that realistic
because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for birthday for somebody
or we even do things real frugally for the kids
we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they dont know the difference at this age whether theyre $unc$jordache new or whether theyre something
of course not
and theyre both boys
so they just $unc$one year after the other in each others clothes
but thats the hardest part for us is that its really budgeting and some extra things that are more nonessential items
i found that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents
uh-huh
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
and i really believe that if youre going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends
on your friends
thats true
thats true
we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with
we both have older cars
and something will come up and wind up having to spend a $unc$thousand dollars on the car in $unc$two months or something
yes
and a lot of things like that really are hard to plan for
and
i really do
i think you have to budget those things though
yeah
kind of put in a certain amount per year
yes
youre going to have on extra expenses for car
exactly
although so much per month anyway
yeah
yeah
and that really should be in your bu-
but if you dont spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
yeah
our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions is to
lets see
i forget which way we do it
we dont list all the deductions
and then we get more money back at the end of the year
no
no
no
no
so thats not a good way to
you dont want the government to spend your money
you want to be able
thats what my husband said
so this last year he changed it of course
we didnt get nearly as much back
and it was like oh no
better find another way of saving money
but i do realize that that is realistic for some people
yeah
and it was for many years
yeah
yeah
and if thats the only way that will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it thats what you should do
yeah
because we dont miss it
we really dont when its just taking out of the paycheck and stuff
but were trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the expenses for college already $unc$eighteen years away or whatever
uh-huh
uh-huh
i was just reading an article in a $unc$north $unc$carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing letters of applications to universities
gosh
she was third out of a class of $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty
so it can be done
i guess
where theres a will theres a way right
thats fantastic
yeah
i have enjoyed talking to you
i enjoyed talking to you too
good luck
and dont spend any money this weekend
i know
well have to stay home and mow the yard
boy
bye-bye
bye
okay
sure
go ahead
what kind of books do you like to read
i like all kinds of books
yeah
mostly i like true life documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i also like romantic novels
i like $unc$readers $unc$digest believe it or not
yeah
so do i
i usually read that from cover to cover
yeah
i like it because theres a little bit of everything in it
right
that kind of a thing
as far as real novels i havent gotten into $unc$shakespeare or any of that type of thing
uh-huh
i wish i had in some senses
but i dont have time really as much as i would like to get into that kind of thing
how about you
i like like you said real life
i like biographies of peoples lives especially athletes
uh-huh
for some reason it seems to interest me people that make a big comeback or $unc$orel $unc$hershiser things like that
sure
uh-huh
and i like to read books on improve like family marriage things that are written by christian authors or doctors about family and how to improve your home and all that kind of thing
i like to re-
the magazines i
to rel-
i like to read
i read a lot of bicycling magazines
theyre
i mainly look at the pictures and stuff
but they usually have some good articles in it
uh-huh
but i dont know
i havent really found any romance type stuff i like to read
im more nonfiction
yeah
yeah
i havent found a lot of fiction books that i really like
but not to say i wouldnt
yeah
eventually
what was the last book you read
jeez
let me think
it
i tell you i havent read a book in a long time
and it
i cant even really remember
i think it was a romantic novel by $unc$danielle $unc$steel or $unc$one of those
really
yeah
honestly
i dont do as much reading like i say as i would like to
yeah
working a lot of hours at work
and
really
yeah
and then of course we have a home
i know
so its
a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or that type of thing
yeah
i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is about $unc$eleven more books than i would have read last year
but so far ive only read $unc$two books
and so im not doing very well
but
but i do crafts too
yeah
so its hard
if i have a minute thats what i do
yeah
i find its real hard
i let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i dont really set aside a time to look or read them
thats the
and thats like myself
i miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too
yeah
i really do
and i dont know
it seems like you can get lost in a book
its like an escape for me
uh-huh
i dont know about you
yeah
its
if im really interested in what im reading hours can go by
and i look up at the clock and say my word
uh-huh
in fact id rather read sometimes than watch t v
yeah
i would too kind of train your mind
but i think you get out of the habit like you say
you have to kind of set yourself
yep
have you ever read or heard of the book this present darkness
no
that was $unc$one of the books i read this year
and its really fast paced and intense
it is a fiction book
but it was ar-
it was $unc$one of the best i read
it was real good
and it was $unc$one of the few books that
it
just hurry up and go through without putting down
yeah
right
thats the other problem i have
if i start into something and i really enjoy what im reading then i have a terrible time getting away from it too
uh-huh
ill stay up until $unc$two or $unc$three oclock in the morning because im so engrossed in it
and then before you know its time to get up and go to work
you know that type of thing
yeah
thats why
i dont know
im kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that
even if im doing something like an afghan if im close to the end sometimes ill do the same thing
uh-huh
i dont know what you would call it
maybe i have a problem
no
im sure its fast or something
its terrible
i really like books that you can get into
and thats that
uh-huh
i know what you mean
i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes
i just sleep better or something
yeah
you do
you kind of get relaxed
thats true
but
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and magazines
i like $unc$people those things that are about real people
uh-huh
and i like to read about people who made a success of their lives to give you specific titles i cant
yeah
what book have you read that is along those lines that was really good
how about who
like i say havent done it in such a long time
do you know who it was about
i went to seminar on
it was by american business
and some of the people
what the heck was his name
im trying to think
hes one of the
paroe
and it was more like
it was tapes and things that they had about him too
uh-huh
how he started out as just a salesman and now hes multimillionaire and that type of thing
and how you have to be aggressive and really want something for yourself and that type of stuff
its up to you in other words whatever happens in your life
yeah
its not up
its not someone else
you have to do it
yeah
and then do it
do it
i cant
im not that focused on something
im off in all directions
and im not a planner which i wish i was
uh-huh
kind of off the wall
if someone says do you want to do this tonight and i got a mountain of things to do its okay we do it
uh-huh
thats all right
i know
i know
but i wish i was more the other way
youre more fun though
youre not ridged right
yeah
right
i
thats
i like it that way though
i dont want to change that part of me
thats good
thats funny
even though i admire someone who isnt like i am and i wish i could be more that way
yeah
but
there may be some schools you could read about and learn
thats true
thats true
how many people do you supervise
about $unc$twenty
thats not bad
no
thats not bad at all
no
do you like your job
sometimes
sometimes more than others
but yeah
i do
thats important
ive been there about $unc$three years
do you have a family
yeah
i just got married last year
and most of my familys in $unc$indiana
uh-huh
so ive only been in $unc$texas $unc$three years
do you like it
yeah
i do
i love the weather down here
i loved $unc$abilene too
thats what i liked too is the weather
yeah
i know
except for tornados
they have storms here
ive
yes
they do
and its so surprising how it just happens
hail and thunder and
yeah
unpredictable
were you here during the hailstorm $unc$two years ago
no
ive been up here about $unc$three
we were down there from eighty-five to eighty-six
no
ei-
part of $unc$eighty-four to $unc$eighty-six i should say
yeah
i had $unc$thirty-three $unc$hundred dollars damage done on my car
a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail
wow
i think $unc$state $unc$farm went bankrupt just about
jeez
but
i know the whole situation is bad up here
were having a terrible time with the recession
really
yeah
yeah
its not good at all
i know things are pretty booming down there
i heard they sold $unc$johnson $unc$city though
yeah
and $unc$colorado $unc$springs
and $unc$colorado $unc$springs
yeah
i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day
and he was telling me about it
wow
they just sold it
amazing
closed up and moved down to $unc$mckinney
thats good
at least they kept the business part of it
yeah
its scary though im telling you
i know
i dont know
and the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
how do i feel what
that books influence
do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
uh-huh
i feel like its important for young children to read too and what you read to them
yeah
when my children were younger of course
they were all married and grown
and i have grandchildren now
they were
i read to them a lot
thats good
and i think theyve all developed kind of an interest in reading also
thats re-
yeah
im not saying they read all the right things
but they do read where a lot of people dont have any interest in it at all
and i think its important
yeah
because even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens they dont learn anything
its because they cant read
yeah
its really surprising how many people graduate from high school that i work with
yeah
and people
i get memos all the time across my desk
and things are misspelled
and its pretty sad
its unbelievable
isnt it
yeah
a lot of people that work for me that cant even spell or read
exactly
and i think that thats why reading is so important
yeah
because i think even mentally when you can do some
i dont
guess we got our first credit card back in the early seventies when i first got married
uh-huh
was a $unc$visa card issued out of a $unc$liberty $unc$bank in $unc$oklahoma $unc$city
uh-huh
because my sister worked at the some $unc$bank $unc$americard center there
uh-huh
so we were still in college
and had she not worked there im not sure that i would have qualified
theyve come in handy over the years
yeah
and they have become also a real bother sometimes
tell me about it
especially if you catch yourself short on cash or if youre on vacation its just easier to put everything on a card
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i find if youre not careful you wind up a month or so staring those bills in the face
and you go i dont remember doing all that stuff
and it adds up
yeah
they add up quick
so sometimes especially traveling with $unc$t $unc$i everything goes on $unc$american $unc$express
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
yeah
but as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible
i kind of like having them for gasoline purchases
yeah
we like to keep $unc$one on hand just for emergencies
but
yeah
but other than that i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day
uh-huh
and then you really get socked to it if you dont watch it
yeah
how do you look at counting credit cards
we just quit using them
thats
and they got us in trouble
we took a loan and paid them all off
we keep $unc$one gas card and $unc$visa just in case theres an emergency or something
right
but other than that we dont use them anymore
thats kind of the way we were doing
its
uh-huh
i guess for that very reason that if youre not real conscious of what youre doing its just too much by the time you get
uh-huh
if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month
uh-huh
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
i know
isnt that funny
yeah
and i give them
maybe theyre not really concerned about getting paid
because theyre
know if you dont then theyre adding on what $unc$eighteen $unc$nineteen $unc$twenty percent
sometimes its $unc$twenty-two percent interest
yeah
yeah
and then some of them add late fees on it if they dont get paid
yeah
and
i guess thats $unc$one of the motivations behind the $unc$american $unc$express card with $unc$t $unc$i
uh-huh
theres no
huh
with the $unc$american $unc$express card from $unc$t $unc$i theres no late fee
uh-huh
theres no interest rate
really
you either pay the thing off
or they come get it
and its turned into personnel
and they come get you
so theyve got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then some of the others do
yeah
yeah
but thats the $unc$one that your call center manager sees every month
uh-huh
so youre a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
yeah
you can
you can use it like any other card
uh-huh
but you know that somebody every month
i see
and who knows how many people are looking at those bills that come in and those statements
uh-huh
uh-huh
youre not the only $unc$one
yeah
so you want to make sure that is that okay that those people see what it is that you are buying
yeah
and most of the time it is
but most of the others ive sent back all you get is card offers
ive got $unc$three card offers now from gas companies and $unc$visa $unc$gold and some other bank
uh-huh
$unc$citibank i think is always sending the $unc$visa stuff out
and i usually just throw them away because i dont want another one
i do too
i dont even open them much
i throw them out
i dont want to have to mess with it
you carry around a wallet full of credit cards
uh-huh
and $unc$one of these days its going to all be full
a girlfriend of mine found a
it was a $unc$visa or $unc$mastercard
she found an ad for one in a $unc$good $unc$housekeeping magazine for $unc$eleven percent
thats not bad
shoot i need $unc$one of those
yeah
no
if they dont say no annual membership on them ill throw them away years ago i had my $unc$visa card through this bank in $unc$oklahoma $unc$city for probably $unc$fifteen years
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then they started charging annual membership fees
and i said adios im not paying you
why do they do that
its just another way to make money as far as i can tell
they get enough on the interest
theyve been
sure
and i guess they figure theyve got enough people out there with cards
theyre going to get cards at $unc$twenty bucks a pop
uh-huh
uh-huh
theres going to be that much more
uh-huh
so then a couple years ago i found a bank here in $unc$plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a $unc$visa card through them and no annual membership
uh-huh
so i went over and just stuck $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars in my sons savings account in his name and got my $unc$visa card
so as long as they have no annual membership fee it would be okay
uh-huh
but i cant see paying someone to use their card
no
i cant either
be charged their $unc$eighteen percent interest yeah
yeah
i think youre right
the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
yeah
really
yeah
gets a lot of people in trouble
yeah
it sure does
maybe theyre counting on that
i dont know
i guess thats it
okay
thanks for talking
nice talking to you
bye
bye-bye
do you have any particular thoughts about the school system
i think that in
recently with the
im not sure if its more a problem with $unc$american families or a problem with the school system
they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems any problems that a child might have whether its actually a school related thing or not
and i
i agree with you a $unc$hundred percent there
yeah
and its gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything
yeah
if youve some kid whos from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like were kind of traditionally the schools roles
yeah
yeah
its interesting
because were just having conversation on this with a couple of people yesterday
and i was expressing my frustrations that so many problems i work in a high school are that kids dont have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large
and you cant expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract $unc$sixteen or $unc$seventeen years of influence at home
right
and its seen more so because when you call parents up many parents wont even recognize that there is a problem
and theyll say my kid
ive never heard anything about this before
this is the first time there have been problems
and you wonder dont these parents know that teachers talk
and we do check with other teachers
and other teachers find the same things in this child
right
and how do you tell the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee
right
but it is a problem
and im not sure just how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it
yeah
whether maybe through a commitment of the $unc$p $unc$t $unc$a and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems of society and that the school can only do so much on it
yeah
then again when you have a society where a certain percentage of the parents are doing drugs in the home either unemployed and have their own problems how do you expect the
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
you cant really expect that parent whos quite frankly a loser in life as it is to care about the situation with their child
thats right
uh-huh
and
you know what scares me too is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children in the school system
right
these are children that are born with low attention deficit
right
and gosh whats going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system
thats really scary
yeah
but i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve
and this is something that i see
too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners
and in fact theyre not
theyre behavior problems
right
and so they get put in our school system in a class thats limited for skills children that really have to master skills
uh-huh
and thats not their problem
at the same time ive seen we have an international population
theres no bridge area for students coming out of the $unc$e $unc$s $unc$o $unc$l which is $unc$english for $unc$speakers of other $unc$languages program
uh-huh
the
once theyre past $unc$e $unc$s $unc$o $unc$l they get out
they got thrown right into the total mainstream
right
and there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition for that
right
so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes having slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems
right
and then the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes
you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated
right
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but theyre discipline problems
and you sometimes
the average classes really are problems because youve got such a mixed bag there
uh-huh
right
the gifted and talented are fast classes
theres really not that much of a problem with
but its
ive seen more incredibly intelligent underachievers than
uh-huh
i would take a person whos motivated and a little less intelligent than the person who is $unc$one of these very intelligent people who just kind of isnt motivated to do anything
thats
yeah
i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is $unc$one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration
yeah
not to toot my own horn here or anything but i was graduated from my high school
i was the valedictorian
and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me
uh-huh
and they proved out late when it came time to take the $unc$s $unc$a $unc$t
mine were good
uh-huh
but they werent great
uh-huh
and when i got into college i struggled just to get my degree in the field that i was in
yeah
whereas i knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all
but they got motivated in college
and they did a lot better than i did
and when it
yeah
i guess kids do mature at different ages too
right
thats
and as a teacher you try to be understanding that there are different ages
kids are
is this a
got a kid that just a question of maturity
or is he a problem child
uh-huh
but teachers are asked to diagnose so much
there were have to be
were alerted
right
theres all sorts of systems where suicide predisposition
were alerted to what the moment we see something
if we see a child thats on drugs such as if hes got a beeper or if theyre flashing lots of money around there are certain things to do
so the school systems asked to do so much
but you cant operate in a vacuum
you actually have students with beepers
were in a rather wealthy suburb of $unc$washington
uh-huh
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the principal
where
what are the
what could they possibly be thinking
how
its for drug use
they cant imagine for anything else
yeah
yeah
its amazing
but you get all sorts of things in the schools
and its
and as a teacher youre alert for the kid whos very drowsy
youre alert to the kid who suddenly has a behavioral change
and you refer them to the nurse
right
and so you have to find out whether theres a legitimate reason or whether this is a warning signal
yeah
how can you expect to
oh yeah
i was sitting in the barber shop
im an officer in the $unc$air $unc$force
and i was having my hair cut
uh-huh
and the barber got a call while i was there from his sons school
his sons in high school
and his son was failing gym and having trouble with a few other things
but this guy was like why theres no problem with my kid
my kids a great kid and all this
the kid had missed all these classes
and basically his answer was i gave him permission to miss
uh-huh
yeah
the denial mechanism is really strong
and so many parents are facilitators
yeah
theyre manipulated by their children
right
ive been fortunate
i have a son whos a sophomore in college up in $unc$massachusetts at $unc$amherst
uh-huh
and my other son is a senior in high school
and hes going on to $unc$williams
and theyre really super
theyre both national level swimmers
sure
and weve been very fortunate
but they had to be held accountable too
right
at some point a parent does help their kid in some ways
but you have to say at what point isnt the help becoming negative
sure
and i think this is where the school system is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system
right
but gee it was good talking with you
it was good talking to you too
yeah
so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and are connected with the schools
yeah
yeah
ive had interesting conversations on several subjects not just this but the different things
uh-huh
its amazing how the people you talk to have some interesting conversations
and its too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all
we are though
yeah
thats true
listen
good luck
take care
yep
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what movies do you like
$unc$gosh
i like just about anything
i think the last $unc$one we saw was teenage mutant ninja turtles part $unc$two
i like the turtles
my little boys $unc$four
and he loves them
we dont have any kids
but we like them anyway
thats okay
how old are you all
were late twenties
and you just dont have any yet
okay
no
ive got $unc$two
gosh
yeah
my little girl is $unc$three months old
and my little boy just turned $unc$four
i had his birthday party yesterday
oh
but hes a turtle fanatic
he even had turtle cake yesterday
but ive been wanting to see turtle $unc$two
is it as good as they say it is
it was
it was actually better than the first $unc$one i thought
good
whats the last movie you saw
ghost
oh
when the topic came up i was asking my husband right quick whats the last movies we saw
he said ghost and turtles
i really liked it
ghost
yeah
i love tearjerker movies
but that wasnt too bad on tearjerker
but it was good movie
not too awful bad
yeah
because that was just so good
and i like $unc$demi $unc$moore
did you see pretty woman
no
but ive been hearing a lot about it
we dont get to the video store very often
and we dont have cable
gosh
we dont really want cable
its just glued to the t v all the time anyway
yeah
so we get $unc$two channels down here
im from $unc$kentucky originally
uh-huh
and we used to get $unc$five channels without cable
yeah
$unc$forty
i dont think you all have the same channels
but here in $unc$texas we only get $unc$two channels
and thats
do you watch soap operas
once in a while when im home
okay
you work then
yeah
okay
we get the channel with young and the restless on it
okay
and then i think $unc$general $unc$hospital
and that comes on different channel
yeah
it does
but thats all we get
and thats no cartoons for my little boy
but weve got a v c r and a lot of tapes
yeah
and my husband is a movie fanatic
i think you would really like pretty woman
it was really a
it made you feel really good
it was just a happy movie
what about total recall
have you seen that
yeah
i saw that $unc$one
thats good
i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was
yeah
it was violent
i try to get away from that
my little boy he loves robo cop
and that movie ill fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is
have you seen it
yeah
the part where theyre shooting $unc$mercy
i dont like that
thats horrible
that is horrible
and the language on thats filthy
i dont see why they have to do that
everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and use different words instead i think
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know
but i think lately pretty womans been my favorite
i went and bought the video
ive probably seen it about $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty times
my husband bought me i think pretty in pink for my birthday
with a
wait a second
i will in a minute $unc$kyle
sorry
thats okay
he bought me pretty in pink
just a second
sorry
youre glad you aint got a $unc$four year old
thats okay
i havent seen pretty in pink $unc$molly $unc$ringwald
this is the first time hes interrupted my phone calls
$unc$molly $unc$ringwald
yeah
it was cute
but it wasnt
i like $unc$sixteen candles or $unc$sixteenth $unc$birthday or
i think $unc$sixteen candles was the name of it
yeah
that was so good
of course i was a teenager when i seen that
and i loved it
i havent seen it either
if you like love stories its sweet
i do
its sweet
it really is
and thats a tearjerker
it gets you
it makes you feel really sorry for her
gosh
but its hilarious too especially with that little guy in it
i dont know he looks like a little boy next door
oh
but hes $unc$sixteen
its a cute movie
i cant remember his name
he kind of looks like $unc$doogie $unc$howser
i dont know
dont know either
bu-
hes got curly blonde hair
he just a little freckly little boy
probably know him if i saw him
yeah
if i could remember the name i know youd know his name because hes played in a few movies
but
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was sleeping with the enemy
okay
ive heard about that
but i cant remember it
thats $unc$julia roberts new movie
okay
yeah
$unc$julia $unc$roberts is good
yeah
shes
this one
you know pretty woman was kind of a light comedy and a romance
uh-huh
and this $unc$one was a lot more dramatic
wasnt it a murder mystery
y-
sort of
it was a mystery
she disappeared from her husband who was abusing her
okay
thats the $unc$one i wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a $unc$ferris wheel or something
yeah
yeah
did that come on t v
or did it come out in the
no
it came out in the theater
oh
and i think around here its all ready quit playing
but i dont know if its still playing any where else
i think
but it was $unc$one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat
real good
i want to see that
yeah
i seen the previews for it on t v down here
but its just been down here a couple weeks i think
okay
yeah
because we saw it probably $unc$four or $unc$five months ago
a month a-
i know it hasnt been that long since ive seen the previews for it
but yeah
i wanted to see it
her husband was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache
or a-
no
he shaved the beard off
yeah
he was a real psycho in the movie
yeah
it was scary
id like to see that
what about
there was a
we got one back here a while
i want to see war of the $unc$roses too
have you seen that
oh yeah
i didnt like it
you didnt
no
it was
i didnt like the way it ended
i know
the only reason i know why it ended is on $unc$arsenio $unc$hall $unc$one night $unc$christopher $unc$reeves told that
uh-huh
i cant believe they killed them
or who was it
$unc$christopher $unc$reeve or $unc$mike $unc$douglas
might have been $unc$michael $unc$douglas that starred in it
yeah
yeah
it was $unc$michael $unc$douglas
$unc$christopher $unc$reeve wasnt in it at all
huh-uh
okay
$unc$arsenio $unc$hall is the $unc$one that jumped up and said that i cant believe they killed them
and $unc$christopher $unc$reeve or $unc$mike $unc$douglas went after his throat you dummy
so i know that they die
but i havent told my husband
weve both been wanting to see it
it was weird
it was a different movie from anything ive ever seen
we was teasing about splitting our house down the middle
yeah
they did that didnt they
and they marked off routes that they could go or something
yeah
that would be kind of hard for us
weve only got $unc$one bathroom
i dont know h-
weve got $unc$two bathrooms
but mi-
actually if he takes
my house kind of looks like $unc$two trailers put together
and $unc$one bathroom is at the end of $unc$one side
and ones in the middle of the other
so we could do it
that wouldnt be too bad
no
and he could climb out the window
wh-
and our whole house has
every room leads to $unc$three rooms
so we can
get around
yeah
you can get around
you just cant go out the front door $unc$honey
sorry
did you see fatal attraction
yeah
thats coming back on too
i know its going to be on $unc$c $unc$b $unc$s $unc$tuesday night
and thats kind of in a way how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
uh-huh
thats kind of how war of the $unc$roses was
i
parts of war of the $unc$roses was funny
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious
and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling
eerie feeling
or i want to see it though
id like to see that and the never ending story came out on $unc$disney this month i think
ive heard about that
i wanted to see that
but i dont know what its about
the never ending story
yeah
its a childs movie
but its good
i enjoyed it
i love $unc$disney movies
yeah
i do too yeah
theyre some of the best that are made
yeah
and its about this little boy who
i think hes up in a attic or some part of school
he got locked in the school
and he got scared
but he starts dreaming
and then hes saving the land of
its been so long since ive seen it
alls i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing
oh go-
it flies through the air
and hes trying to save the land from some ooze
but its really good
it sounds ki-
it had $unc$fred $unc$savage in it
no
no
no
no
no
did you see that movie with $unc$fred $unc$savage in it though
i dont think so
with
he had
it was the princess bride
nope
i didnt see that
you didnt see that
that was cute
that was a good $unc$one
i like slapstick comedy
so do i
and a lot of times well go to rent a movie or something
and youre not sure whether it will be any good or not
so sometimes we stick with the stuff weve heard more about than
yeah
i heard
a friend of mine told me she got naked gun last night
and she said that was hilarious
yeah
we saw that
and theyre coming out with a sequel to it
$unc$two and a half
it was funny
it wa-
yeah
i want to see that
she said she rented it last night
and said it was real good
an
and working girl is really good
i seen that
that was good
was that with that blonde
she pretended to be the boss or something
yeah
yeah
i rented that $unc$one night by myself
i was home alone
did you see home alone
yes
i did
that just reminded me of that
did you like it
there you go
first question
do you own your house
right
we try
its a big mortgage in the sky
and someday maybe we might even own it
but for all practical purposes i guess we hold the mortgage
our name is on the till
yeah
right
so that implies ownership
no one else has offered to pay for it
thats right
i would not object if anybody did
yeah
really they could move right into the spare room
yeah
we have had this $unc$one for $unc$five years now
before that we lived in $unc$garland probably about $unc$four blocks away
uh-huh
liked the area chose to stay inside of $unc$spring $unc$park
its a
i dont know if you have been up here
but it is a residential homeowners association
right
yeah
so theres a lot of activities a lot of pluses and common land
but we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market
it could not possibly have gone any lower
and so we were wrong
$unc$five years ago
yeah
yeah
i think
what
it bottom out about a year later
yeah
it
just recently i would say i would give it $unc$two years back when it was i think bottomed out
oddly enough $unc$two years
i think that
but maybe not in your area
it was just different areas
not in this area
cause this is about the
thats a really nice area
yeah
besides its not $unc$richardson is it
its still considered $unc$garland
no
its $unc$richardson
ok
yeah
its $unc$richardson
and hold on a second
$unc$paul i can hear you perfectly perfectly well
i dont want to hear you
you are being rude
whatever you ask or scream when im on the phone the answer is no
do you understand
how does that sound
there you go
write that one down
yeah
there i go
it sounded good to me
yeah
i hate to say how long that will last too
no
this area up here is all custom homes
and its
right
i dont think that many by the builder that built this house
and we were not the first owners
i think we are the third owners
okay
it was built by the architect for himself who never moved into it who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep
no
yeah
caulking windows was a great mystery to them
gee
so they just watched the water pour in on the carpet
but its a $unc$sharif $unc$myneer $unc$homes if that means anything
it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it
i kept thinking of $unc$omar $unc$sharif every time i saw that name somewhere
so
he builds $unc$eight $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollar houses now
i think he got out of the lower end market and decided
but the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below $unc$two $unc$hundred
wow
yeah
but still i know that this $unc$one was built for $unc$two $unc$ninety $unc$nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it
right
and i think somebody told me its also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course
great
yeah
and the guy around the corner is being transferred
so he said he did comparables that its about $unc$eighty dollars
lets see what
i dont remember if he said it was $unc$sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and $unc$eighty on the creek or if it was $unc$eighty and a $unc$hundred
yeah
probably $unc$eighty
i think it was $unc$sixty $unc$eighty
$unc$sixty $unc$eighty
i think
because i know our little house over here stuck in the middle of the subdivision is i think $unc$fifty $unc$five
so i think the high end is definitely somewhere there
try and think if it was a $unc$hundred dollars a square foot
no
it could not be
because this house has around $unc$thirty $unc$four $unc$hundred square feet
and it would never sell for $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollars
yeah
just never
maybe thats pretty close to what it would have sold for brand new
or thats pretty much what it was built for
its got an awful lot of nice things in it
but i think its going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really desirable
its seems like people go for square footage only now
yeah
and have you been back to the $unc$perry $unc$homes back here
the ones that look like brick houses
the one that looks like $unc$monopoly apartments
right
yeah
i think those are awful
im sorry
i just dont see the designers
i just see him as trying to squish as much house into the space as possible
they are huge when you are inside them
yeah
they are very spacious
they are
i was in $unc$one today
it was $unc$forty $unc$two $unc$hundred square feet
yeah
uh-huh
thats
the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i
because theres just the $unc$two of us
and the $unc$two cats can yell at each other from $unc$one end to the other and be heard
and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that
when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you wont hear them
yeah
thats true
but i have been watching these houses go up
and i dont
somebody was telling me
i know somebody who lives back there
i have always questioned the quality of construction
and i dont think they exceed more than $unc$twelve nails per house
oh
when you watch them go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over
yeah
and it takes them something like $unc$thirty days to complete a house
thats amazing
right now in fact even as we speak we are having a deck put on in back
and these guys are phenomenal
they are doing such a terrific job back there
you pay for it too
but its really worth it
they are putting in a deck a redwood deck
uh-huh
and its just they are doing such a fine fine job
we have got $unc$three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down
im really excited about it
uh-huh
and the house is built around the trees
great
and with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up
so its real real shady
but thats $unc$one of the few things that really immediately pays back on return
but what i was going to tell you these $unc$perry homes back there
yeah
when the people from $unc$m $unc$c $unc$i come down
and they are used to the $unc$virginia area metropolitan $unc$d $unc$c
my $unc$god they come down here and those houses that look the colonial look what the
looks like the george town brownstone
right
yeah
and the idea of ever owning anything that has $unc$four $unc$thousand square feet in it for less than $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$twenty $unc$thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house
must be a dream
yeah
because those things are selling like hot cakes
but $unc$one of the people that was living back there was telling me that his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars a month
oh
and i thought
i cant
and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here
and i was thinking i know why your $unc$god damn bill is so high
he has no insulation probably
its because theres no insulation in those things
my
yeah
gosh
what a trap
any yet
they show very well unless you have lived in a lot of houses around the area or looked at a lot of houses around here
and you ask the right questions and can research
yeah
yeah
and i think that makes a big difference
but i like this area
and everything that i have been saying says that its
i do too
i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even
but still its worth it for the area and for the school and things like that
youre in the
yes
i think that $unc$plano has really done a fantastic job
at least their plans are good
however i was
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that theyve had some problems with the recycling on plastic
with the plastic
uh-huh
i thought that was most interesting
i thought it was sad that it started out as a good program but then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there
yeah
yes
and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didnt want to set at the curb or take to the dump
yeah
thats right
and its too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing
yeah
i guess thats going to happen
yeah
a really good effort
thats right
yeah
but
i was thinking about many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in $unc$missouri i went
this was probably
it have been like $unc$nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight
i went to a meeting
and $unc$one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling
and she was from $unc$saint $unc$louis
and she had this fantastic family effort in recycling
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum
oh
and i thought wow $unc$one person is doing that
but my thought was its a shame
its wonderful that shes doing it but wouldnt it be much nicer if we all did it
because her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us
and we were just sort of talking about it at the time
and here we are
now were doing it on a city wide basis in communities
doing it
so its wonderful that weve come that far i think
but
what did she do with
if she
was she like a group that was doing it
or was she doing it on her own
and what did she do with the
i think she was
i was trying to remember
it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in $unc$saint $unc$louis
there were places where she could actually take her things herself
uh-huh
and so it wasnt something that was being picked up
and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing
and i thought wow that is wonderful that somebody does that
you have to really want to do it though
yeah
this is
even what you recycle
because we do the plastics and the aluminum and the glass and the paper
uh-huh
right
yes
and of course then you try to buy right too a lot of our neighbors say you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure its that and you have to
sure you do
uh-huh
yeah
we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans
uh-huh
isnt that amazing
and i thought what are you complaining about when youre only going to get picked up once a month or once a week
yes
and
people i dont know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort
rather than work with it
yeah
yeah
i dont know
its
i know what youre saying
kind of people like that sure it is
its for everybodys benefit
its not
so maybe we dont realize it in our lifetime
but you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren
yep
and what kind of quality of life are you leaving them
yeah
its on down the line
right
and i have a real concern about that
yes
yeah
i agree
when
weve never had much trash
because while
i was raised in a big family
and genes family wasnt big
uh-huh
but they werent rich
yeah
and they had to recycle
sure
and the fu-
they didnt
they just used things
they didnt throw things away before they were used up
yeah
right
and
yeah
i know
i guess i got a good example from my mother
because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things
and she is to this day
and i mean shell even
uh-huh
if she
for instance she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for when she made cookies
it would go on that
or if she needed sandwich paper or something shed use that
yeah
right
she recycles everything
and i have done the same thing
i recycle zip lock bags and things like that
right
my kids get the biggest kick out of that
although they do the same thing
i think they give me a hard time
right
but i think they know that its the right way
theyve picked up the hab-
they do
and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things then they say hey mom used to do this and dad used to do that but
uh-huh
yes
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that
yeah
thats right
i dont know
i wonder how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to make this whole thing work the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually making sure that you take stuff over to
some people now are complaining because the stuff isnt picked up at the curbside
and i think golly moses you just do your part
people are not
you cant be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out
right
this is what concerns me
you
over in $unc$europe they dont have the kind of waste we do here
no
thats right
youve got to be in a country
even in $unc$mexico you dont see things thrown away like we do here
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
what we throw away is a kings ransom to most people
yes
uh-huh
and i
and even to people in our country who scavenge for food
yeah
and i think you have to get into a period of need bef-
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
you cant tell a person that lives in a $unc$hundred $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that theyve got to be careful
uh-huh
uh-huh
no uh-huh
this is why i thought $unc$jimmy $unc$carter was never very pos-
people didnt like him
because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that
yeah
yeah
right
do those little things
yeah
and nobody wanted to hear it
that make a lot of difference
$unc$uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i
and i think youre right though
its
i think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes
uh-huh
or you have to grow up with it being important in your life before the message really takes hold sometimes
uh-huh
and i dont know
its just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am even myself than i used to be a few years ago
right
id go to the $unc$u $unc$t $unc$d cafeteria for lunch sometimes
uh-huh
and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldnt need to use styrofoam plates
right
and i think to myself thats crazy
i wonder if maybe i need to bring that to someones attention
uh-huh
uh-huh
and im seeing more and more of that
and i think its just mcdonalds effort to reduce the number of styrofoam boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff
right
i think is a good example that even industry is willing to do it
huh
i think the big question too were looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled
yeah
i think thats kind of what its coming to im sure
thats right
and do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage
yeah
yeah
thats right
yeah
and i dont
with the mind set of the american public i think what they will do is start paying $unc$mexico that isnt harmful
uh-huh
wow
that wouldnt surprise me
uh-huh
or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
yeah
yeah i know it
thats the way we solve problems
and unfortunately
and its sad
$unc$hal whats crime like in $unc$dallas
it depends where in $unc$dallas you are
uh-huh
there are certainly parts of town i would not want to live in
yeah
because its the situation
it is very location dependent
uh-huh
and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire
yeah
yeah
in $unc$baltimore we have similar
i live on the outskirts of $unc$baltimore
and we live right outside the city
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though im in graduate school
i live here because its close to the university
uh-huh
but we have
its really funny
the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious
uh-huh
and i think most of that is because their parents arent around
that make sense
yeah
yeah
what they call the latchkey children
yeah
something like that
no ones
or fathers are just missing
so theres no consistency there in the home or whatever
theres no $unc$one to tell them whats right and whats wrong
yeah
sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class
so i think our
uh-huh
not that we dont have a certain amount of local problems
uh-huh
but on the other hand we get the affect of the city
and the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes a small number of assaults
uh-huh
if we have $unc$one murder a year thats probably as many
yeah
but then you go into $unc$dallas and they are unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than $unc$one a day
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think were about the same in $unc$baltimore
though $unc$washington i think is close by
and they experience a lot more
uh-huh
i think they definitely have more problems in the area
what do you think can prevent crime
the thing is i dont
its $unc$one of those things where if youre a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on
uh-huh
unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like wherever there are more criminals there are more policemen
yeah
but thats which came first
yeah
but on the other side of it is
basically the problem is in the society and the societys views
uh-huh
and since now im in my mid-forties when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought crime was reasonably unknown and just the situation thats developed with the drug aspect of the pushers the dealers and the addicts
uh-huh
yeah
yeah uh-huh
yeah
i think i agree with you there
because it just was not something back in the sixties that i even had to worry about
uh-huh
but i think that there is a lot in the society where things have changed
so its effected all of us
uh-huh
yeah
i think the drug culture definitely is $unc$one of the main problems
yeah because it would eliminate the violence and the market i guess the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it
uh-huh
uh-huh
that make sense
hes one of the big proponents of that
he gets on national television and says that
so its
and he was a district attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming mayor
so thats a really stran-
its a different viewpoint
i
in a sense i have real mixed feelings on that
yeah
because it comes a bit from the angle that the
it would certainly be an interesting test
uh-huh
but the other side of it to me
what happens if we lose worse
y-
the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side
and i think if i look back $unc$fifty or a $unc$hundred years id say back then there were the opium dens
right
but the thing is if somebody ruined their life society didnt try to then save themselves from it
they let this person who had ruined it die or whatever
uh-huh
they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short
right
yeah
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise
we need to take care of people even if they have physically ruined themselves
yeah
they have induced it themselves
yeah
yeah
thats true
and so to me thats
i would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then dont use them uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think they did that in $unc$alaska that actually $unc$alaska just recently legalized marijuana
but i never heard results or anything like that
so i never
plus it really couldnt be a good test because alaskas so different than every other part of the country
uh-huh
but that was interesting
i dont
crime is $unc$one of those things thats
i dont know
the drug culture
the
i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
yeah
some of that
and of course im a baby of the old school
yeah
but it bothers me from the fifties on
not that id remember that much from the fifties
uh-huh
but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality
yeah
thats true
thats true
we worked hard for everything
thats very true
and so they
uh-huh
in the
there were the $unc$sixty-four $unc$thousand dollar question shows in the fifties
but nowadays theres so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing
of course i work for lawyers a lot
uh-huh
and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and theres a $unc$million dollars you can have for mental duress or whatever
uh-huh
yeah
but the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the
in $unc$europe they seem to have mentality
and drunk driving is a good $unc$one
is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable
right
and yeah
if youre going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver and we mean it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think that the drunk driving has actually just caught on
and i really
uh-huh
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school
uh-huh
and that was an awful $unc$three years afterwards of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did
uh-huh
and the guy went free because this was $unc$twelve years ago $unc$thirteen years ago
uh-huh
there was no
his father was even the police chief of the town
uh-huh
so there was no repercussion at all other than insurance
but he was uninsured
yeah
so our insurance paid for everything
but it was a very difficult time
and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a new car
and somebody had taken a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and dented it everywhere
uh-huh
and they came and questioned us
yeah
and
but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was misplaced for years
right
uh-huh uh-huh
it was an acceptable social behavior
yeah
very much so
yeah
those are some important points
yeah
i
those are
what does your city have for gun control if anything
$unc$maryland is $unc$one of the most
we just voted in strong gun control here in the state of $unc$maryland
i think
the weather certainly has been hot
and its been humid
i dont remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high this late into
its not really late into the summer
but the humidity has hung around all of $unc$june
yeah
are you native to this area
no
i grew up in $unc$michigan but ive been in $unc$texas for $unc$fifteen years
okay
uh-huh
but i know the summers get hot
but it certainly
uh-huh
this humidity has just really hung on there
yeah
yeah
it seemed like last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in $unc$april
and this year we really didnt have heavy rains until $unc$may
kind of like pushed the season back a little farther
and now its kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity
and it just tried to rain
i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago
and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in $unc$july
yes
normally we dont have too much humidity or rainy time when its past $unc$june
thats right
thats right
i can remember it not
its really $unc$august that it happens
you get those great big cracks in the ground where its been so dry
right
and it just gets so dry
and the earth opens up
i can remember the first year i moved here
uh-huh
and it didnt rain
i moved here in late $unc$august
and it didnt rain from $unc$august until $unc$december
and i went home and told it just doesnt rain in $unc$texas
it was great after growing up in $unc$michigan and every day was cloudy
almost every day was cloudy
and you sort of forget how much it did rain
and coming here and then it didnt rain
it was just wonderful
yeah
i lived in $unc$ohio mainly
i lived in $unc$pontiac just a little while before i came down here
yeah
and so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather
it might rain on your little parade
thats right
thats right
and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime
and you really didnt have too much of a chance of it getting rained out
yeah
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do
thats right
what part of $unc$michigan were you living in
i grew up in $unc$dearborn which is a suburb of $unc$detroit
okay
yeah
yeah
you probably know where that is because i know where $unc$pontiac is anyway
yeah
what brought you down here
a teaching job
so you teach in $unc$plano schools
yeah
i did for a while
uh-huh
so im home with $unc$two children so
oh
okay
new career
okay
but anyway
so that kind of
i had been down here to visit
so i school and said hey lets find a place that has a nice job
and thats how it worked out
yeah
i think a lot of people were leaving $unc$michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
yeah
you know the little joke about will the last person leaving $unc$michigan just turn out the light
its a nice place
thats a nice place though
i said i lived in the $unc$pontiac
i didnt live in the city of $unc$pontiac
i lived to the west of it
i forget the county
but where all the lakes are around there
okay
sort of
i lived in an apartment complex on $unc$one of the lakes
it was real close to where i worked
it was only $unc$four miles to work
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that
in the summer you feel like youre on a vacation all the time because youre right on a lake
and everybodys out enjoying the water and such
and in the winter time the lakes froze over
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there
but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes
theres lots of really small ones out there
yeah
maybe a mile $unc$two long
yeah
thats enough to do some boating
thats right
and it was lots of fun
thats right which is
i think its toward $unc$ann $unc$arbor
so its probably out in that direction
but thats the only one i probably could name after all these years
uh-huh
but
yeah
yeah
but it was just lots of little lakes
and of course it was a little more expensive to live on the lake
but i just thought that was grand
and i think a lot of people didnt really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them
but there was quite a few lakes all around there
it was almost like you were living on an island
there was so much water around where i was
i said i wasnt close to downtown $unc$pontiac
i was way out to the west maybe $unc$four or $unc$five miles from the city limits
and it was really nice out there
yeah
we had $unc$pine $unc$knob to go skiing and stuff
oh
right
right
so there were things around there
really was pretty nice
sure
sure
and isnt that where they have a summer music festival there too
right
right
in the summertime they have musicals there
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope
thats right
thats right
i know we used to
we didnt do a lot of it
but we did
yeah
yeah
so those are always fun
and $unc$alpine was it $unc$alpine was another ski slope that we went to it was nice
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i always tell people that in the winter we used to
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on make a pond in the backyard for us
yeah
yeah
but we probably did some ice skating on it
but then it chipped
and it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
so
yeah
yeah
we used to have a
$unc$christmas time some of our relatives would come up from $unc$alabama
and i think most times we would have snow around $unc$christmas
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
yeah
because they were from $unc$alabama where it never snowed
oh
and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it eternally
oh
right
right
if only it would make nice snow here in $unc$texas wed be okay at $unc$christmas time
my first winter here
i came down in early $unc$eighty-two
and there was just a freak snowfall early $unc$one morning in $unc$december couple days before $unc$christmas
it lasted only a few hours
by noon it was gone
yeah
yeah
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all snow
and i was laughing going yeah right thats a good practical joke
ha ha
they said no really theres snow
and there was but a very short time
and the weather got warm so quick
yeah
it just melted it all away
yeah
yeah
i know
course when we get an ice storm thats not too much fun
no
thats not fun either
so i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets
but we have
our house is kind of on a little hill
so we get the sled out
and the kids go down the hill on the sleds when its icy
they just go down the ice
yeah
and if its cold we say okay out you go
i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
yeah
i think its fun
even the couple of ice storms ive gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit
sometimes the ice is pretty bad
but if you get on the grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction not slip and fall
first
i really havent seen any movies lately
so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised
but i think i havent been to the movie theater here in about $unc$six months
but the last movies that ive seen were probably on video
thats
we rent a lot of videos too
yeah
we saw
i have $unc$two little babies
and we saw one movie recently
and that was the terminator movie which i didnt like after all
uh-huh
yeah
now i havent seen the terminator movie
and thats kind of blood and guts isnt it
i dont particularly care for that sort of stuff
i dont either
it
on all the advertisements $unc$arnold $unc$schwarzenegger says he doesnt kill anybody in the movie
he doesnt
he maims them
yeah
right
yeah
he maims them pretty good doesnt he
uh-huh
i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie
yeah
uh-huh
i saw sleeping with the enemy
i saw it
i havent seen that one yet
couple weeks ago i rented it and watched it
and i was pretty disappointed in it
because i was told by several people that its pretty scary and intense
uh-huh
and i was pretty disappointed in it
oh
its a good movie
but i guess that they built me up too much for my expectations in it there
yeah
with all the commercials and everything
uh-huh
i havent
thats one we want to see
i want to see dances with wolves
uh-huh
but we havent seen that one yet either
yeah
i havent seen it either
but ive heard that its real long that its a good movie but its long like $unc$three hours
yeah
thats what i heard too
yeah
weve got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it we saw the movie with $unc$sylvester $unc$stallone $unc$oscar
thats right
thats right
$unc$oscar
supposed to be his debut in comedy
uh-huh
which was an interesting movie but not very funny
yeah
i know my daughter saw that
and she liked it
so
did she
yeah
it was an amusing movie
uh-huh
it j-
i guess maybe it would have been better if wed have been at the theater as opposed to just at the house watching it with no $unc$one else around
uh-huh
uh-huh
so
and of course i get to watch all these movies like look whos talking and look whos talking too
because i have a $unc$ten year old
so we watch a lot of movies around that category that she can watch
oh
uh-huh
my son just turned $unc$two
and so the little mermaid is now our favorite movie
yeah
we seen the little mermaid too
little mermaid and $unc$peter $unc$pan i think are his $unc$two favorites that weve got
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think theres some good $unc$disney movies fixing to come out on video shipwrecked
i didnt hear that was coming out
uh-huh
yeah
its fixing to come out on video
and boy i cant think of the other one thats fixing to come out
they just had the rescuers movie
but
uh-huh
that was a $unc$disney movie wasnt it
i think i heard that was just out
he doesnt sit still for the whole movie yet
but he likes to listen to the music and stuff if theres a lot of that in the movie
right
uh-huh
im glad to know that theres somebody else out there that doesnt get to go to the movie theater
i tell you ever s-
my kids are just small babies
and i tell you we really want to go a lot
yeah
and theres so much out on video now that its almost
the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it sometimes
uh-huh and then they go to the dollar movies
uh-huh
that seems to happen
i noticed that dances with wolves was playing at the $unc$granada $unc$theater
uh-huh
and someone said that was a lot of fun to go do
you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie
i thought that might be kind of fun to do
yeah
that does sound fun
and of course you need a baby-sitter for that
definitely
but
id really like to get out to the movies more often
course its so expensive now too that you cant hardly afford it
right
i know we get discount tickets where my husband works
uh-huh
but other than that it just seems like its so expensive
and then the popcorn and everything else
you almost cant afford to do it no matter what
thats right
although we did actually get
we went on vacation couple months ago
and we got to go see what about $unc$bob
uh-huh
that was kind of a funny movie with $unc$richard $unc$dreyfuss and $unc$bill $unc$murray
uh-huh
that was fun
golly
i dont think that ive ever heard of that movie
$unc$richard $unc$dreyfuss is a psychiatrist
and $unc$bob is his patient
and $unc$bob follows him on vacation
its
thats the $unc$one where they burn down the house or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
the house explodes
uh-huh
okay
yeah
thats the $unc$one
okay
yeah
another movie that i want to see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is
i just forgot the title of it
its supposed to be a real scary $unc$one
darn
heres another one that ive seen
i saw
i cant remember the title of it either
must have left an impression
how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
i dont feel very good about it
but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do
we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore
uh-huh
he actually died a few months after that
and so as
at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
right
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
the
he wanted to get into a $unc$mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had a $unc$ten year waiting list
my
right
we wound up just choosing another $unc$mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
but naturally
it was even $unc$mennonite related
it was actually not a particularly great nursing home
mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in
yeah
so the convenience
right
what do you think
my grandmother lived with us until $unc$august
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home
she has leukemia
uh-huh
and the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in $unc$dayton and were several $unc$thousand miles away
yeah
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home
and my sister being on the other end found $unc$one that she could have what was called an independent living facility
she had her own little room and didnt have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
yeah
yeah
thats important i would say
yes
and the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to $unc$ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or $unc$two
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
okay
so she didnt have to be transported back and forth
so shes been there since $unc$august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well
its not her favorite place to be in
shed much rather be here with me
but when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her
yeah
and ive got little children here who needed me here
she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day
right
and that becomes difficult then
she was falling down and hemorrhaging
and all kinds of physical problems
so it just became too much for me to handle
even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldnt anymore
uh-huh
yep
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life
but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
oh
and this
eventually things just went too far
yeah
and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home
yes
i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions
it sure wouldnt have been grannys decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home
but shes accepted it real well now
right
thats right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide whats the right thing
we enjoyed having her here
and
but we feel shes much safer where she is now
she still continues to fall
but when she does a nurse is right there to help her
uh-huh
and i know shes eating the right things
and her doctors right there where he can come in and check on her
so it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
yep
so i think shell adjust
okay
while i was waiting for you to connect i thought of a couple of menus
so i decided it had to be in it informal or not
because thats a lot of fun especially this time of year where its so nice out
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
if it was formal id probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something
im not into formal dinner parties
but id probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread
i see
so what do you use for cookbooks
i have a $unc$pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married
but its kind of the bible of cooking for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
then i have some from church that are more family recipes that are more useful budget cookbooks
uh-huh
and of course you get a lot from when youre growing up
uh-huh
uh-huh
i cook a lot the same as my mom did
of course ive added several different recipes
right
but or what would you
i think we come from different backgrounds
so the
thats good
i
so it diff-
have different perspectives that you are
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book to fall back on
uh-huh
because it has almost everything in it
but on the other hand its not very inspiring
its a good reference when you need to dig something up
uh-huh
what weve found very useful is a book called the $unc$thirty minute cookbook
i think thats the title by $unc$marion $unc$burroughs
which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in $unc$thirty minutes the whole meal
yeah
and so shes
that would be wonderful in these times
yeah
i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than $unc$thirty minutes
yeah uh-huh
theyre interesting combinations that nobody thought of
uh-huh
whats $unc$one of your favorites
gee
the $unc$one i had most recently was one that she describes as $unc$jim beards favorite summer menu or something
and it consisted of grilled kielbasa sausage a potato salad with olive oil and some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
uh-huh
wow
sounds too good
thats certain you can do in $unc$thirty minutes
yeah
but there are a whole lot of
i would recommend you look at that book if youre a busy person
yeah
that $unc$thirty minute cookbook
$unc$thirty minute cookbook
that sounds fun
i find a lot of the cookbooks i dont know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i dont keep on hand all the time
uh-huh
and i have young children
and our budgets set at this time
but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand
uh-huh
i dont have to run to the store to buy or look for something i havent heard of
yes
yes
thats why sometimes i shy away from more of a traditional cookbook
uh-huh
but it was interesting talking to you
its a fun subject
food is $unc$one of my favorite things too
yes
anything else you wanted to add
you had said dinner
what would i put together for a formal dinner
we had some friends over as recently as $unc$saturday night
wow
and put here
the inspiration was a combination of $unc$julia $unc$child for the dessert a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do
$unc$uh-huh
thats good
uh-huh
basically youre baking chicken in an open pan having marinated it first
and my wife did this part so i dont remember all the details
uh-huh
marinated in olive oil and some seasoning and cooked with some olives and some prunes
theres a little bit of brown sugar in there
and it bakes up
and its a delicious thing
and its easy
that sounds good
comparatively im sorry
that sounds really good
i just love
it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am
im pretty simple right now
but
maybe a little more leisure time to do it
yes
i dont know
thats true
i have little ones
and they wont eat too many different foods right now
yeah
i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes
yes
yeah
there again sometimes it was easy
theyd
canned ravioli was $unc$one of their favorites and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli
yeah
spaghettis a pretty staple every other week or so
yes
and it goes a long ways too all righty
nice talking to you $unc$cheryl
okay
talk to you later maybe
bye
do you have children
yes
we have $unc$two sons
ones a freshman in college
and ones a sophomore in high school
oh
and you
i have one thats a freshman in high school a daughter and a son whos a sixth grader in a middle school
okay
and i spend most of my time carpooling
oh
the story of my life
yes
yes yeah
my kids are involved in sports
my daughter has played basketball for $unc$six years
and my son plays football
i
my rule is that they cant play a sport the same time of the year because theres just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere
yeah
we did spend a lot of time
it really helped when the older one was old enough to get his license and could drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems
yes
i know
i know
the insurance
but i fo-
yeah
for $unc$one thing
but yeah
we do
but our $unc$two had totally different interests of
but there was not much overlap as such
the older $unc$one was not at all into sports for the most part
he participated
band and scouts were his $unc$two big things
yes
my son is in both band and scouts too
and the younger one is the sports $unc$one
and whatever season it is hes playing although football is really his favorite
gee
yeah
so yeah
we spend a lot of time carpooling and then trying to be up as much as possible with anything that they do
right
but then we also didnt spend time with them trying to
just family time
uh-huh
we had a
at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth
but we didnt do it as much or as often as i would have liked to
i would like to do that as a family and some t v watching
yeah
what about you
we found this oriental tile game called $unc$mah-jongg
yeah
ive heard of that
have you
ive never actually played it
but
its really fun
$unc$one of my neighbors moved here from memphis
and a lot of them played it
and she started a group going in the neighborhood
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it
and its more fun with $unc$four people
yeah
yeah
and its a game that none of their friends know how to play
and they both enjoy it
so if they want to play they have to play with $unc$mom and $unc$dad
yeah
so we play that a lot of them
and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
yeah
we have family that lives outside of the state
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips
yeah
so do we
so that
and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly
okay
yeah
my daughter and i hate camping so we go shopping
so that just kind of works out real well
yeah
and im a writer by profession
and my daughter enjoys writing too
so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together
thats neat
yeah
yeah
no
weve never had anything like that
yeah
so that gives us special time together too
yeah
and shes on the yearbook staff and things like that
so i can help her with that
and she gives me ideas for my writing too
so
uh-huh
yep
uh-huh
good
in terms of any sorts of trends i
obviously things are different for me and my children than when i was growing up
yeah
i grew up on a farm in $unc$iowa
and the whole family was around the whole time
and then what my father did was obvious to me
and i helped out with it
but although i have brought my boys to see where i work its not that easy
and its certainly not at all common
and they just dont really have that same idea
right
so they
its a whole different kind of thing there then
my husband has taken us to work with him
and we still dont know what he does
yeah
so we just say he travels a lot
so that kind of covers it
yeah
yeah
that makes it hard though in terms of family time with him
yes
yeah
yeah
ive been lucky in that respect that i dont travel too much
hes been on temporary duties where hes been gone $unc$nine months
oh
yes
yeah
so those are the real killers
if hes just gone
yes
hes gone $unc$three weeks right now
and thats mild compare to the big ones
yeah
so i just do the carpooling and handle whatever needs to be done
and something major always needs to be done
yeah
yeah
so you just have to handle it until he gets home
yeah
yeah
right
and hopefully he wont have too many surprises when he gets home
lets see
so what gets you
as far as im
the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have young children a baby in the house
and inevitably as soon as theyre asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
uh-huh
and i think that that is probably the most aggravating
uh-huh
it invades my time
im the one that pays for the phone
if i want to buy something ill take the initiative and go find it
and that just really does aggravate me
what do you think
i
thats exactly the kind of thing i would have said
although in my case its my wife and i both work
we come home
and just as were preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
and its $unc$one solicitation call after another
and
your time is valuable
yeah
its like you say very annoying
and
and why do we let this happen
i
thats interesting
i
the market seems to just be growing too
i guess enough people are not speaking out
im not speaking out thats for sure
i just get aggravated about it
and
would you
if you could legislate something what would you legislate
i really dont know
im not into heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas
but i dont know
i do particularly find it annoying
im really not sure to be
yeah
it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we dont want to receive calls like that
that might
and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that theyre going to call against this list of people who dont want to be called
identify themselves yeah
right
that would be an interesting way
yeah
and that way those who want it can have it
and those who dont want it dont have to have it
right
sort of like an unlisted number where you havent gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself
right
youre
except even unlisted numbers arent safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers automatically
is that right
thats interesting
and
and they just get everybody
right
boy
i do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
yeah
and i guess the next $unc$one is door-to-door solicitors
uh-huh
i dont mind the children when theyre selling things for school
i have kids
and thats just kind of part of it
yeah
but when its adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about $unc$ten oclock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe
uh-huh
yes
and its annoying as well
and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob
right
you really dont know
so i find myself being a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than i might normally be
uh-huh
but i do feel like its an invasion of my space
yeah
and
ive never quite understood the purpose of that
yeah
i
i think these people were hired from different sources
just be-
with
and so therefore theres no $unc$one answer
but yeah
basically its a market survey
just a survey
but they never say who theyre really working for or what questions are
yeah
there have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it
and then there have been several times when i just said i just really dont have the time to deal with it at that moment
yeah
yeah
but i dont get too many of those
yeah
ive had just a few
yeah
generally someones trying to sell me something
or
right
and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
right
right
other times its wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose
right
for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider
yeah
thats right
but a dollar isnt it
its
oh
and i also sort of worry that sometimes people giveaway personal information
when the call comes and they sort of seductive to
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things
and so i start answering
and then you go down a path
right
and you dont know where its going to end in fact you dont even know the totality of what youve revealed this isnt most likely not going to be used against you
yeah
we
thats true
but it could
and that seems to be something that should really be outlawed because its subject to abuse
yeah
you just never know i guess
that
yeah
i
and it
asking for information is
i cant really see that
i think if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp
and when it arrives at your house i
okay
what kind of house do you live in
we live in a brick home in far north $unc$dallas
and its $unc$four bedrooms and $unc$three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back
and its about $unc$thirty-five $unc$hundred square feet
uh-huh
it sounds like ours are pretty similar
i live in $unc$one
i dont have a swimming pool
and mines about $unc$twenty-seven $unc$hundred square foot
yeah
but the $unc$four bedrooms
and all the rest of it sounds just about alike
i think its pretty much typical for this area
it is
have you been living there very long
ive been in the house
im in here right now about $unc$twelve and a half years
so youve been there longer
we built this one about
lets see its been $unc$six and a half years ago
uh-huh
and we subcontracted it out ourselves
we bought the lot and had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
really
uh-huh
and then we subbed it out
so weve been here a little over $unc$six years now and have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
uh-huh
i bet you
uh-huh
my husband got his big garage
we have a $unc$three car garage that he has a big work area in
uh-huh
and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
and so he has all the work space he needs
that sounds interesting
i bet hes enjoyed having it that way
he
because some-
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications
it is
and thats why we decided to build
we looked at things that were already built
uh-huh
and if the house was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were $unc$three car garages which is what we have
then most of them dont have a $unc$three car garage
uh-huh
theyre kind of rare
so we put a $unc$three car garage in
uh-huh
but even if they had $unc$three car garages they didnt have a work space
all of it was taken up with just car space
uh-huh
and so he has a big landing area thats between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
uh-huh
that
weve just got a $unc$two car garage
but my husbands got a big space in between where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop workbench and everything
sounds like our husbands have similar interests
mine does not work on cars
he just piddles on this and that
i see
but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things
uh-huh
thats nice that its not in your house
it really is
uh-huh
because they have a lot of things of their own
and i wouldnt mind having
and i at $unc$one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
but someone
i dont know
it ended up i got some furniture back that $unc$one of them had moved out or something
right
so i didnt end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would
we still have a son and daughter in college that come home
uh-huh
and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husbands family come
his parents come
and also the kids have friends who come and stay
uh-huh
and so it seems like its always used as a bedroom
uh-huh
i still
all $unc$three of my daughters are married
but i dont know
i just still have need for the $unc$four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things
right
i understand
and weve got grandchildren now
so when they come they have to have a place
we
thats true
and you dont want them to not be able to come because theres no room
thats right
you sure dont
at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice
i havent reached that point yet
ive heard people say that
but my middle son is engaged
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while
uh-huh
hes out of college and has a good job
uh-huh
so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet
uh-huh
and my daughters been going with the same boy for a while
but shes still in college
and were just as happy for her to finish her education first
uh-huh
thats what she plans to do
i dont blame you for that
i hope so
i have the $unc$three girls
and then we ended up with $unc$four grandsons
ho-ho
and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls
a whole new world
uh-huh
and i enjoy them coming but for short doses
i can understand
it feels
after theyve been here $unc$ten minutes they have already explored the entire house
they know everything
uh-huh
but theyre fun
so youre all back to the safety catches and the whole $unc$nine yards or either watching them every minute
i just watch them
yeah
i never did put things up when my kids were little
and i havent with them
i try to teach them not to get into things
thats the same thing that i did
i hope ill be able to do the same with grandchildren
i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes
at least my daughters have
they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up
so its worked pretty well
theres
i dont really think anythings been broken
every now and then we have to kind of go and say now dont bother this
uh-huh
but all in all they mind pretty well
but i guess most of the hou-
d-
what kind of roof does your house have
here im getting off the subject
we have
all right
ive never done it before
so i guess thats all i have to do right
i guess so
ive been called several times
and i pushed in my number
they kept saying you have the invalid code
really
and then i found out that my new phone wasnt working right
oh
so this is the first time ive even done it
yeah
i wonder how long its going to be on for
i think $unc$five minutes is the max
no
this whole thing like for $unc$two months or something
do you know
i dont know
yeah
okay
back to crime
i guess were supposed to talk about that
they say what aspect are you worried about
i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect
right
especially you since youre in the same metroplex
theres so much going on here
i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common thats really something you got to protect yourself from
that and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in
uh-huh
golly
i know
and
have they done that in $unc$garland
no
i
not that im aware of
now
i just heard last week at that $unc$one school they started putting them in because there was that $unc$one shooting
right
so
we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the school grounds after school
is that right
and the $unc$one boy killed himself a few years ago in a grade school
so these kids dont have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood doesnt seem like
uh-huh yeah
yeah
so yeah
its kind of scary to think you send your child to school
and you wonder if hes going to get shot
we didnt have to worry about that before
i know
what next
i know
its getting
its been out of hand i think for a while
and it just continues to get worse
right
and we cant really depend on the police to solve all this
they just cant do it
yeah
i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
right
and how we going to bring that back together
yeah
thats
i thi-
i agree
i think thats where it stems from is that and youve got a lot more women that are working nowadays that arent home with the children
uh-huh
right
and
and that may impact it as well
i think so
and then theres a drop in the training of morals really
right
right
some of these young kids you read about just doesnt bother them to kill someone at all
yeah
i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals wouldnt kill somebody in cold blood
they dont think twice about it
yeah
either that or i dont know if it happened and it wasnt as highly publicized as it is now or what the
i think it was just rare
i really do
uh-huh
my mother shes $unc$seventy-four now
when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in $unc$california
and she was dating this millionaires son
and he wanted to marry her
and she wouldnt marry him
and so he drove out in the country $unc$one day and shot them both
and
youre kidding
no
im the $unc$one
himself and her
yeah
that must have been at least $unc$fifty years ago or more
but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks
wow
i bet
but now you wouldnt probably read about it here in $unc$texas
i know
its just another killing
they were
i was watching some show the other day
and they were talking about mass murderers
uh-huh
and they brought up what happened in $unc$killeen here recently
and they were saying that these guys want attention and that when it happens theyre glorified because its on all the newspapers and t v and everything
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
lots of their picture and life story and everything
right
and then you get to their life story
they came from a broken family
uh-huh
this person had mental problems
right
right
i know how we straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
yeah
so that story i just told you about my mothers beautiful cousin the same thing happened here in $unc$arlington when was it i think it was almost a year ago in $unc$december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
is that right
yeah
i think it was on a $unc$hard $unc$copy
she was a real attractive blond girl in her freshman year of college
uh-huh
and some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties
i remember seeing that
remember that
i saw that on $unc$hard $unc$copy
right
right
thats
yes
my daughter graduated with her from $unc$arlington $unc$high $unc$school
is that right
yeah
can you believe it
thats just
im trying to remember
he had her in the car in front of a $unc$taco or something
$unc$taco $unc$bueno
right
uh-huh
and he just shot them himself and her
uh-huh
right
i remember seeing that
yeah
isnt that weird
yeah
theres just too many crazy people out there these days
i know
and the police are not going to do anything until theyve committed some sort of a crime
he was just begging her on the phone
thats not doing anything
yeah
and there are times i think gee i should give my kids gu-
not be a very good conversationalist on fishing
i dont do a lot of it
i do love to fish
good
maybe i can learn something
i dont know how much you can learn
im not so sure im good at it
but i do enjoy doing it
do you
yeah
it is fun what little i do
of course i dont
i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
i told my husband last night when i had called and they had told me that this was a topic i said i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm
he said i dont think thats the different kinds of fishing theyre talking about
i hope it is
theres not a whole lot of different kinds
thats about the only kind i know how to do
i dont do a lot of deep sea fishing
because i get seasick
but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i do a lot of fishing for bass
we have a couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass
uh-huh
and then when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish
uh-huh
and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows
uh-huh
and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms
uh-huh
it all depends on what im fishing for and the time of day
it sounds like you do quite a bit of it
i do
theres a lake maybe $unc$two or $unc$three miles from here
and its very convenient on afternoons when i want to just get away and sit and think
uh-huh
fishings a good way to do that
and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing
do you have a boat
no
i dont
i have a friend who has a little inflatable raft
and we use that sometimes
uh-huh
uh-huh
i wish i had a boat
but i dont
i think the lakes are probably different in $unc$michigan than they are in $unc$texas
the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock
uh-huh
but unless you have a boat you cant really get into where they call the good fishing holes
right
thats the same way here isnt it
is it
you have to get back in the sticks in the
uh-huh
my in-laws live on a lake a little bit east of $unc$dallas kind of in the $unc$piney $unc$woods
and the lake is beautiful
and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish
but actually catching fish to eat $unc$per $unc$se you dont really do much of that right there
i catch a lot of little old i think they call them perch
right
and then the turtles try to eat up all my bait
oh
so its so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit
we dont have a big problem with turtles
but its kind of fun
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes
i would be afraid of that
and i cant think of a time that ive been fishing that i havent run into $unc$one or $unc$two of them
do they ever get on your hook
no
we
occasionally ill catch an eel on a hook but never the snakes
uh-huh
they just kind of
are they poisonous snakes
we have a lot of cotton mouth
so yes
they are definitely
uh-huh
and they live in little coves that i like to fish in
so i seem them swimming by every once in a while
yeah
i think id be a little bit afraid of those
yeah
theyre certainly ugly
uh-huh
we saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws place last year
it was probably $unc$four inches in diameter or something like that
great big snake
and of course it scared the women to death
but the men come out and said thats only a king snake it wont really hurt you
but it looked so bad
yeah
and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us
but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there
definitely
but theyre scary looking
do you have bass
yes
i think that probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
right
thats pretty much the same way here
uh-huh
i
they have a lot of bass tournaments
we have those
i dont
uh-huh
inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing
no
i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it
uh-huh
thats kind of
weve never entered a tournament or anything
were not that big into fishing
but i see a lot of people
early in the morning therell be all the boats going out
and theyll say theres a big bass tournament this weekend
and all those people are here for the tournament
yes
so i think theres a lot of people that have i guess that youd call it really sport fishing
theyre really into it to try to win
yeah
definitely
my
certainly here they are
but its a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around
the peace and calmness is really relaxing
yeah
its a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish
uh-huh
thats what i do a lot
ive never tried taking a book with me
ill have to try that one of these days
hi
this is $unc$donna $unc$donahue
$unc$hi $unc$donna
hi
ready to get started
yeah
i think so
okay
sort of an interesting topic since i just got back from lunch here
okay
what did you have for lunch
it was
im an officer in the $unc$air $unc$force yeah
oh
oh
thats interesting
okay
so our topic is food today
is that
yeah
okay
if youre having a dinner party what would you serve
okay
do you want me to go first
sure
okay
if i was having a dinner party i would probably have some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some salsa and chips around and peanuts
and then lets see i usually have a little theme when i have a dinner party i would have maybe say if it was greek night or something maybe on the barbecue wed put cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used for greek and a $unc$shish $unc$kabob and mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then wed have a big greek tossed salad kind of like a $unc$caesar salad
uh-huh
and lets see what else
maybe some rolls and i guess some rice or something like that
how does that sound
jeez
when is the party here
yeah
yeah
that would take some planning
but
i dont know
being the bachelor here that i am i dont think id b-
its not a question of capability here to do something like that
its just theres no motivation
thats right
i want to throw some charcoal on the grill and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
but
that sounds good too
i have $unc$three kids
uh-huh
so when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little $unc$two younger ones upstairs
and usually we just have very plain kind of not very interesting meals pizza and that all
uh-huh
so once in a while when we do something like that its kind of fun
but its not a regular thing are we supposed to talk for about $unc$five minutes
yeah
yeah
it
yeah
thats what they are shooting for here
okay
lets see now
wh-
okay
you would have a barbecue wouldn-
i live on a lake here
uh-huh
so it
and then during the summertime its real nice to be able to entertain outdoors
sure
thats a little more a casual thing
but in the wintertime its not bad too because then ive got a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that
so we really good place to do entertaining like that
uh-huh
that sounds wonderful
i just havent really tried a whole lot
but i dont know
uh-huh
lets see
$unc$one time i did have a dinner party
i served a
i had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits and kind of southern food even though im up here in $unc$new $unc$york
uh-huh
so
you are in $unc$new $unc$york right now
yeah
oh
im in $unc$texas
i didnt know this was from all over the whole country
yeah
yeah
i see
it is
its
and im originally from $unc$long $unc$island
no kidding
yes
and where are you in $unc$new $unc$york
upstate
upstate
$unc$rome
in $unc$griffins $unc$air $unc$force $unc$base
okay
okay
is that where you are originally from around there
okay
and been all over the place
wow
thats interesting
okay
lets see
sometimes when i have a dinner party ill have everybody bring something
yeah
and thats real interesting because then you get different kinds of foods and new recipes
and sometimes somebody will bring something that you really like
right
and get the recipe from them or whatever
and we are just getting interested in mexican food
because here in $unc$texas they have lots of really good mexican restaurants
uh-huh
and were just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could
sure
do you know what a fajita is
yeah
yeah
yeah
ive been down to $unc$texas a few times and had the pleasure of their good mexican cuisine down there
okay
yes
they have some delicious delicious things
and i
since i always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts
uh-huh
and you boil them maybe like $unc$four chicken breasts
and you boil them until they are cooked maybe like $unc$thirty minutes
uh-huh
and then you debone them and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled
and you take little bit maybe $unc$two tablespoons of butter in a big frying pan and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt
i guess ive always kind of liked golf
i worked on a golf course at $unc$one time
and thats how i picked up golf
and i dont know
its just kind of a challenging game
it sure is
i play at least $unc$three times a week
uh-huh
im on it
i havent gotten the chance lately though to play
im trying to get back into it
so i got to start all over again
its not like riding a bicycle
you do tend to forget
no
im one of those rare left-handed golfers
oh
yeah
and i do enjoy playing
what is your handicap
right now its $unc$three
okay
i was down at about $unc$four or $unc$five quite awhile ago
its probably up there to $unc$twenty now if i start again
if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
yeah
yeah
i have got to try and get out there
i know with our long winters i enjoy watching it
i dont know if its just because i like the game or i just like to see the warm weather
we can usually play here year around
sometimes in $unc$january its not too comfortable to play
uh-huh
but there is usually $unc$two or $unc$three days in the week that you can get out there and play
and im pretty much addicted to golf
so i get out there $unc$one way or the other
yeah
thats the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter
you almost have to relearn every spring to get back out
its a good game though
its very challenging
and the reason i like it so much is because im essentially playing against myself
yeah
thats the way i look at it
i play in a lot of groups
but they keep score between themselves
but i really dont care
i go out
and each shot i say this is what im going to try to do
uh-huh
and then i see how close i can come to that
right
yeah
you always work on trying to improve each day
and
yeah
and inevitably $unc$one facet of my game isnt working at $unc$one time or another
$unc$either im not driving very well
or im not hitting long irons very well
or im not putting well
but sometimes it all comes together
yeah
yeah
i know what you mean
when i used to golf out there id putt well but i wouldnt chip well
$unc$one of the $unc$two
or something would go wrong
but i always managed to get near par anyway
we just had the tour championship here in $unc$pine $unc$hurst
oh
and i went to that
$unc$craig $unc$statler won in a playoff
uh-huh
but we
this is a big golf area
yeah
we have a lot of
id say we probably have within $unc$fifteen miles $unc$twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course $unc$pine $unc$hurst
and we still have the $unc$greensboro $unc$open here every year
uh-huh
do you have long waits to get on the course
yes
we do as a matter of fact
its only been that way in the last $unc$five years
yeah
but now you
most of the courses have a $unc$two day advance tee time you have to call
yeah
okay
i just moved into this small community
so im going to try and get into one of the golf courses here
im hoping that wont be cou-
i was from the $unc$twin $unc$cities area
thats some cold golf too isnt it
yeah
are you sure you guys arent having the bad weather
we have cold
yeah
usually $unc$january and the first $unc$two weeks of $unc$february
i wish thats all we had
but last week we were in the seventies
something is coming through now
so its like in the low forties right now
oh
but its supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
we have very windy winters and very cold
yeah
but we dont get any snow anymore
i dont know what changed that pattern
we used to get $unc$four or $unc$five inches a year
now we get nothing
its been probably $unc$five years since weve had any measurable snowfall
i see
at least that doesnt get in the way of golfing
so that
no get out my orange golf ball and go out
yeah
yeah
thats what they do here sometimes
you hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there
but if you got
okay
what do you think is the worst culprit for air pollution
i think its probably a combination of things
factories that burn coal as an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants
and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
uh-huh
those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain
and i think thats probably hurting us a little bit
its hurting $unc$germany for example too and some other parts of $unc$europe where they have high industry
so were not the lone ranger here
yeah
i
its hard to put the finger on whats worse know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion with your hydrocarbons causing the damage in which
yeah
hopefully were backing off from that a little bit
but i know we havent cured it yet by a long shot
i notice on one of these home shopping networks they were selling these halogen fire extinguishers
yeah
and the halogen is an ozone depleter
and it got hydrocarbons in there
its a very clean fire extinguisher
but its really bad on the environment
yeah
yeah
i guess i missed that one
yeah
automobiles of course are contributing too
and you know how we are with our love affair with the auto
yeah
kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
i know
in the $unc$twin $unc$cities area
i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right
but they had a new policy where in order to get your your car license renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
yeah
and
we have that here too
but its part of the inspection sticker
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe
and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out
and so thats the way theyre dealing with it here
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess that was just mainly in the cities there
and as far as where i live i dont have to do that
but i have an old car which i doubt would pass the inspection a $unc$seventy-six
yeah
and theres no way i would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards
yeah
itd probably be difficult anyway
yeah
so although i do what i can to cut down pollution
but
i was just reading an article in $unc$mother $unc$earth $unc$news magazine
yeah
and theyve got a new
a lot of places are burning wood
yeah
a lot of people are burning wood
those of us who have
ive got a place in the country
uh-huh
and theyve had catalytic converters on those on
i think theyre required in $unc$california and $unc$oregon and $unc$washington
but theyve had up those for quite a while
and somebodys come up with a new one that sort of
its a catalytic converter
its a plate that fits into the smoke pipe
yeah
and apparently it sort of feeds itself
the more smoke is produced
after you get to like $unc$five $unc$hundred degrees the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is
and it sounds real neat
i havent seen them priced anywhere yet
but that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on older stoves that dont have any kind of $unc$e $unc$p a requirements on them
yeah
that might help a little bit especially in some places
were really lucky here
we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
yeah
sometimes we get a kind of a
especially in autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us
but most of the time its blowing out pretty well
yeah
probably blowing up there to you guys
yeah
around here we get
it depends
either in the winter time it blows it your way
and in the summer time we probably get yours
yeah
it comes back
yeah
i really think were doing some important things
education raising consciousness awareness
i know school kids
i work for the school district here
and this is $unc$one of the big things with kids
kids are writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act
yeah
and its
i hope were not too late with it
were having all kinds of recycling
yeah
it thats a big thing too
i know it has nothing to do with air pollution
but i kind of look at the way people treat our
surprised they get anybody this time of day
but ive been trying all different times
uh-huh
but i dont get anybody at $unc$five $unc$thirty dont get anybody at $unc$nine at night
so thought ill try
im at work
and i just happened to walk back into my office
oh
ive been gone for a little while
oh
i go to school
so im home certain days
uh-huh
and i really havent been making any phone calls have you
got
i havent ever made any
i just receive them
oh
have you received many
i havent here lately
yeah
yeah
its
the first time we were on this it came just about every day
yeah
i never had to make one
they just always came
yeah
exactly
people must be tired of it or something
anyway i guess were supposed to discuss this subject
what do you think
i never gave it any thought myself
i was hoping you could tell me what you thought
oh
i dont have any objection to people doing that
i think it might be good for them
uh-huh
but as a mother of $unc$two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent
exactly
im just concerned about their safety because if they do good work in $unc$america theyll probably be sent to a ghetto
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and if they were sent to a third world country i couldnt help but wait worried
yeah
yeah
that would be my main objection i dont think
uh-huh
i dont know
i think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis
it will probably never happen
but
yeah
yeah
i think it would be good for everyone to do something like that
but i guess i dont feel like it should be something forced upon you
yeah
it probably wont
uh-huh
i dont even know how wed pay for it anyway
we cant seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats another consideration
exactly
but i dont know
some kids are so spoiled nowadays
it might be a real eye opener
really
sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
and then they think
theyre just kind of shocked at that side of town
uh-huh
uh-huh
i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl
i have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to $unc$mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while
oh
that would be an eye opener wouldnt it
wouldnt it though
right next to us is such a pitiful country
uh-huh
it is
i know
sometimes i wish wed help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries i never even heard of
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know it
it seems to me we are
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country right on our borders
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but what do i know right
im just sitting at home and doing laundry today and certainly not up
nobody has called me from $unc$washington
but anyway how did you get on this program
i work at $unc$t $unc$i
you do work at $unc$t $unc$i
youre in $unc$lewisville
uh-huh
yeah
i just went by that place
we were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost
and we went by
thats the first time id seen it
it looked really nice
yeah
a lot of trees there
it looked like a sight
hang on a minute
sure
no
i dont think so
yeah
$unc$patty might
im back
sure
di-
but how did you get on it
my husband works at $unc$t $unc$i over on $unc$central
oh
why were living in $unc$arlington im not so sure
but he works over there
and tha-
we did it last time
uh-huh
so just my daughter and i are registered this time
i dont know
they didnt even ask him back
really
that was weird wasnt it
but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time
uh-huh
i dont get too many
and i can never find anybody
so
the first time i used to get calls from far away too
right
like $unc$maryland and $unc$new $unc$jersey
uh-huh
but now it just seems like its in the $unc$dallas $unc$fort $unc$worth area that i get calls from
yeah
ive had the same experiences
uh-huh
all right around here
uh-huh
yeah
i dont know
i wonder if they really
i dont know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents
theres so many with this $unc$one town
uh-huh
uh-huh
even in some families some people talk a little bit different
yeah
yeah
my husband is from $unc$new $unc$jersey
and $unc$one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me
and he doesnt pronounce them at all that way
and thats $unc$one family right
of course i think everybody in $unc$new $unc$jersey sounds a little bit funny
but
i agree
how that goes
shoot
$unc$god
im surprised she hasnt told us to cut it off yet
sometimes she says at night or overloads
yeah
so please end your conversation
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject
no
i sure dont
you dont have any kids you want to send over here
no
no kids
is
shoot
i dont know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto
$unc$one of them is real idealistic
she might
my sister is
id be more suited to that than her
shes just bugs
okay
you ready
yeah
is that it
thats it
okay
i guess we have to talk about magazines
and what
what kind do you subscribe to or do you
i did subscribe to $unc$people for a long time
i do
i enjoy $unc$people
and now i subscribe to $unc$ladies $unc$home $unc$journal
i take a computer magazine and also $unc$better $unc$homes and $unc$gardens
uh-huh
okay
are you interested in computers
and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside and the cardboard pages
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that would be $unc$one of my peeves
my pet peeves with magazines the womans magazines especially
its really geared to
all they have
you have too many recipes first of all
i just dont
thats what i dont like about $unc$ladies $unc$home $unc$journal magazines
too many recipes too many can this marriage with saved nonsense
i like to read articles about things that matter
of course $unc$people magazine is not $unc$one of your more intellectual magazines
but its nice light reading
if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
thats true
i like it when they have short stories
$unc$redbook used to always have a good short story in it
thats true
yeah
they did
and i havent bought a $unc$redbook in a while
so i guess
yeah
i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
is $unc$redbook still in existence
i dont know if theyre around anymore
yeah
i think it is
its an institution
surely it would have to be
yeah
but
ill tell you the only reason i subscribe to the $unc$journal is because of
which i think it was either
yeah
it was publishers $unc$clearinghouse
right
they told me if i didnt subscribe they were going to take me off their list
so
mine too
this was it my last chance
yeah
my last chance to win $unc$ten $unc$million dollars
so i figured hey look for $unc$twelve dollars
i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to $unc$entertainment
thats it
yeah
uh-huh
and i was real disappointed with it
yeah
i dont know
it just
not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into
right
its little short articles more than anything else
uh-huh
and thats $unc$one thing i dont like about $unc$people
it doesnt seem to have enough story to it
i dont know
i just think its light reading
if youve only got a short time to read
you dont have to concentrate
no
thats true
its entertaining
and thats
i enjoy it
i
that $unc$entertainment is very
isnt it similar to the $unc$tv $unc$guide
no
not really
not the one i take now
its a magazine
and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes
uh-huh
i see
and im a real movie buff
so thats why i thought i might be interested in it
but it just hasnt been what i thought it would be
uh-huh
and the reason i get the $unc$home $unc$journal and the computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me
oh
otherwise if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf ill pick it up then rather than having them delivered and think i really need to read this
right
right
ill tell you since ive been getting the $unc$journal maybe ill read $unc$two maybe $unc$three
if i read $unc$three articles in $unc$one of the journals i figure i did really well
yeah
because theres just nothing in there that interests me
im not into recipes
and
i do like recipes and crafts
and im not into crafts
so that eliminates $unc$three quarters of the magazine
thats true
i just got the new issue
they have $unc$bette $unc$midler on the cover
so that should be $unc$one article that ill read anyway
do you
how is the weather out there
its really cold
and supposedly for this time of the year its unseasonably cold
and theyve gotten more snow than theyve ever had
really
you have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff
how about you guys
its about same
the usual i think
oh
nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff
its good
yeah
lets see the snow here is different from utahs
because i have lived in $unc$utah for $unc$ten years
really
what part
and
$unc$provo
i was going to $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
really
okay
yeah
and the snow is really cold
its really humid
so it seems wetter or something like that
its
its more humid in $unc$utah than there
uh-huh
or there
its more humid in $unc$iowa than $unc$utah
okay
right
yeah
okay
and it seems like when the winds blow it goes right through you
its really different from utahs weather
i thought $unc$utah was cold
but i think $unc$iowa is a lot colder
yeah
thats how it is in $unc$texas too
because when its cold its really cold
so
yeah
i dont think there is any mountains to stop the wind
whats that
i dont think there is any mountains to stop the wind
right
yeah
so the humidity is i think what does it
yeah
i think thats true
because i noticed when i got here too
because id
when it would snow in $unc$texas wed be really cold
uh-huh
and wed have to get really warm
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when its snowing
and you dont feel super cold
yeah
yeah
thats true
it was weird
yeah
so how long ago did you graduate
or did you
or
i graduated in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-seven
really
yeah
my husband got his doctorate at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
so thats
and so he just graduated this past year
oh
so you just barely moved away
uh-huh
yeah we really miss $unc$utah
do you like it out there
we miss the mountains
you do
yeah
because its really flat here
not flat but hilly
but no big mountains or anything
uh-huh
so you just moved away a year ago
in $unc$august
wow really recent
yeah
but what else can i say about the weather
today was warmer
it was $unc$forty-five
warm
so whats the temperature today over there
man
its probably $unc$fifty $unc$fifty-five maybe
really
maybe not that warm
probably about
yeah
its not that cold really
and whenever i remembered the weather reports in $unc$utah i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill
yeah
but they talk about wind chill here all the time
yeah
thats a big deal in $unc$texas too
they said it could be $unc$six degrees out and negative $unc$forty-one wind chill
so thats what were not used to
yeah
thats true
that makes a big difference
so i
so did you used to ski when you were out here
whats that
did you used to ski when you were in $unc$utah
ive only skied in $unc$utah once
really
i only skied once my whole life
but do you do a lot of skiing there
not tons
but i like to when i get a chance
uh-huh
ive only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then
just saving my money for $unc$christmas things and that
yeah
so is this your first year in $unc$utah
no
this is actually my third year
and youre going to school there
uh-huh
oh
yep
at $unc$u of $unc$u
or
no
at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
really
yeah
oh
but ill be here a long time at this rate
whats your major
it was nursing
but im in the process of changing it right now
uh-huh
oh
because its really really competitive at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
yeah
you have to have a $unc$three $unc$seven to get in
so its really
thats true
im going to look into some other fields
id like
all the science classes and that im just not really enjoying too much
so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school
uh-huh
so
yeah
thats a good idea
did you graduate in a certain field
or
education
i got a double major
in
elementary and special ed
really
uh-huh
that what my sister did
really
yeah
you might know her
here name is $unc$lori $unc$bird
maybe not
i think she graduated around then too though eighty-seven probably
but she got her doc-
yeah
i cant
there are so many girls in all my classes
i cant remember how many people
yeah
yeah
because they since stopped that program where you can get it double pretty easily
have they
oh
its really
were set
okay
what changes do you feel have happened
i guess the first thing has been for the right for women to vote
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were
and thats probably going to increase
right
increases each year doesnt it
im sorry
it increases each year i think
it sure does
yeah
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays
and i think women have kind of had in the past the real subservient role
role
right
and
thats changing
we do to some degree
right
but i think its not as much as it was
right
yeah
i agree
it definitely has changed
and especially i think with women increasingly working theyre going to have to demand more from men
uh-huh
because there is just impossible to keep up on everything else
yeah
yeah
have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home
theyve been talking about
and i dont know what the status is on it
but women get maternity leave and stuff like that
and i know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out
right
but i havent really heard much about that recently
there is a lot of companies that wont give women maternity leave for that very reason
uh-huh
in fact i know the school districts down here they dont have maternity leave
you simply have to accumulate your sick leave and take your sick leave
is that right
oh
uh-huh
and i dont know if bigger company companies do
but when i was employed with the school district i didnt have maternity leave either
and that was the reason
because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
so
thats interesting
thats a bummer though
yeah
it is
you got to take the time off
you have to save all of your vacation time
you do
you have to save all your vacation time
and thats usually how its happened
yeah
but
uh-huh
what do you see changing in the future
i think that were probably going to see a lot more companies run by females
right
and top level
and well prob-
im sorry
maybe top level
right
right
upper management
more women in upper management
and probably well see more females in political roles
more governors and i think roles like that
that would be kind of nice
in $unc$texas we have a female governor
thats right
thats right
and we had a female mayor here in $unc$dallas
and her term just ended
so i think were probably going to see more of that in the future
yeah
i think thats probably good
a little more integration
uh-huh
and maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
and
right
and thats fine with me
i think
but sometimes
im not a womens libber by any means
but i do
right
there are issues that as far as equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff i totally am for
right
but i dont get into the real women libber movement
no
i dont either
i dont think theyre ever going to prove that men and women are equal
yeah
we just function differently
right
right
and im not capable of lifting what a man can lift and that type of thing
yeah
but $unc$one of the big changes theyre doing in $unc$salt $unc$lake is
right
and theyre probably
im sure in $unc$dallas since youre big places a lot more women are working right out of their home with their p cs or with their lap computers or whatever
yeah
ive heard of that
i havent really talked to anybody thats too involved with that
but i think that is a
i think that
like the cottage industry
is that what youre talking about women working out of their homes
right
yeah
i think its wonderful
right
you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
and
yeah
course theyre talking about that were going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that
i kn-
by the phone and all that
so it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that
and some ways it might be kind of scary
right
think anybody could do it
but anyway
right
yeah
i wouldnt mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up
right
right
but then there is the process of selection
would you have to give them the brand when you shop you usually compare the prices
right
right
and would be nice though
how big is $unc$provo
that a little town or a bigger city
its not $unc$one of the bigger ones its probably i compare it to the size of $unc$plano maybe a little smaller
$unc$plano $unc$texas no
oh
i talked to someone that was only a couple of $unc$thousand in her town i think
yeah
i forgot the name of the town
i thought maybe it was you
anyway were supposed to talk about education
i certainly have some ideas since im studying it now in college
id say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school
uh-huh
because they really teach you about $unc$forty percent less than they used to
and it shows up
thats $unc$one idea
do you have any
i dont know
i think im pretty satisfied with
i grew up in $unc$plano
uh-huh
and my dad is actually on the school board there
so i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on
yeah
its
$unc$plano improved greatly in the last $unc$twenty $unc$twenty-five years
yeah
thats for sure
it used to be the pits
and $unc$arlington is excellent now
but im just speaking overall across the country
oh
yeah
something is definitely wrong
uh-huh
and $unc$one thing they dont spend as much time just teaching reading and writing
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year
and they truly cant read
right
so i dont know how they expect them to pass history when they cant read anything even read a word problem in math
so thats definitely a problem
another problem is youre going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do
right
but
so what do you think is good about the schools
that is good about
it depends on where you are
theyre all so different
thats another thing about the $unc$united $unc$states
yeah
theres no national curriculum
what theyd be teaching in an $unc$arlington school they may not be teaching in a $unc$plano school
uh-huh
and in the same school district even in an $unc$arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an $unc$english class
you may have half literature for the whole year
whereas in another one theyre going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature
grammar
its up to the teacher in other words
so thats kind of odd to me
yeah
it depends on what school youre in and who your teacher is actually
uh-huh
or is how you end up
overall $unc$arlington is good $unc$one of the better ones in the state
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here
uh-huh
so yeah
thats the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you
uh-huh
of course we have a slight problem in that the number of the illiterate in $unc$america is mushrooming at this point
and where our kids might be in a great school were still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they cant read
uh-huh
so
but do you think that there should be nationwide curriculum
i dont know
i just read about that the other day
and i had never even thought of it
actually it makes sense to a certain extent
because sometimes a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didnt even learn what
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach and according to her plan
uh-huh
so i guess if there was a national curriculum wed at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
right
but we actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes
thats pretty low that theres $unc$forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
yeah
so unless we want to keep paying for these people that cant make it in society were going to have to do something
i dont know
obviously nobodys smart enough to have figured it out yet
so i probably cant
but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first $unc$five $unc$six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
because they cant even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays
right
you cant even work an answering machine if youre at work and had to get a message or something or fill out an application to work at mcdonalds if you cant read
uh-huh yeah
so i think thats a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades
and they say that the average english student nowadays does at least $unc$fifty percent less reading and writing than they did $unc$twenty years ago
and thats a big jump
i believe that
did you go to school in $unc$plano
i did
through high school
uh-huh
kinder-
up there maybe you guys dont have as big a problem with air pollution as many do you
we have a terrible air pollution problem
do you really
our summers are extremely hazardous
uh-huh
and during certain wind directions because we get the $unc$gary $unc$indiana $unc$chicago pollution
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake
thats horrible
uh-huh
and they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season
uh-huh
in the winter its not as severe
right
but if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
uh-huh
the state of $unc$wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against $unc$illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
uh-huh
i dont think its going to go very far
but it was a way of triggering awareness
right
right
so whats the conditions like in $unc$dallas
in $unc$dallas i havent seen air pollution quite on a level that we had in $unc$denver
i grew up in $unc$denver
and ive lived there most of my life
and we used to have the posted warning days
however in $unc$colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now as far as health concerns
due to the emissions control on the vehicles seems that all of our smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry
$unc$wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for their pollution control equipment
uh-huh
and if they dont qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable
so theyve tried to do a lot of that
uh-huh
and i thi-
there seem to be at least in certain little pockets
and we were talking earlier about $unc$madison
uh-huh
$unc$madison has $unc$one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in $unc$wisconsin
really
and all $unc$wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
uh-huh
uh-huh
and there is a real promotion of biking
uh-huh
but there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere
right
i find that a little irritating because i dont think its always so necessary
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it becomes
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some more beautiful parts of the country i think that we become a little more aware rather quickly of whats happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is
i notice people in $unc$dallas seem to say sure theres air pollution but really how bad could this problem really be
send them to $unc$wisconsin
and well let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain
really
uh-huh
and they may wake up
uh-huh
howd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain
right
right
its really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here
do you find that do you hypothesize that most of the smog or air pollution comes from vehicles
or does it come mostly from industry up there
i think its mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of the $unc$gary area
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
that causes the acid rain
that im a little uncertain of
but i do know that it is a problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
i had talked with my parents
i was born in $unc$muncie $unc$indiana and grew up a little bit in $unc$terre $unc$haute
and i had asked them before
i went back to visit recently about a year ago
and i asked them
i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
im sorry
thats okay
i didnt hear
hobbies
okay
let me see
i dont know if that took or not
ill do it again
okay
okay
what are your hobbies
i hear you have kids right
you heard her in the background
thats babies
thats your full time hobby right
takes a lot of time
i like most sports
i like to do that
i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing
uh-huh
little bit of embroidery work once in a while
uh-huh
what do you like to do
i try to do some painting although im not very good at it
im sure you probably are
no
not really
you like it
thats the main
yeah
i inherited the genes that make me think im creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be
thats right
so i always try
i do some sewing mostly out of necessity
im making drapes for my house just because im
boy thats hard sewing
yeah
it isnt and it is
it is
actually the sewing isnt the hard part
its just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room
measure it and get it to
it depends on how elaborate you get it
if you get pleats and all kinds of
yeah
ive been doing that
and that
thats a lot of work
yeah
that
but usually have to do the pleats by hand
so that at least i can do watching t v or whatever
oh
but
right
right
yeah
and ive gone and put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through
but
that feels really good
yeah
so thats not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i need to do it
to do it
right
lets see i have a dog and a lot of fish
keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby
keeping fish
theyre probably easier than keeping dogs though arent they
yes and no
it depends on how frequently they die and how much that bothers you
no
how much that bothers you
and you probably have to clean out the tank too
thats
you dont have to do as much as i thought
in fact my problem
i had fish as a kid
and they always died immediately
no
and what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean
youre kidding
because you have
because they need to have a little bit of the
right
you need to let the bacteria build up
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
i see
and i would just take everything out and just wash it with scalding hot water
no
and it would kill all the bacteria
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
and so youd have to start all over to build that up probably
so
right
thats right
so now i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
right
right
and i dont try and sterilize things
dont go through the whole $unc$nine yards
and they kind of need a little bit of that
thats right
thats right
so youve had fish for a long time
ive had them
i guess its been $unc$two years now ive had a tank here
and then back at home i used to have a small $unc$five gallon tank
but that never worked well i have $unc$fifty-five gallons now
what size do you have now
thats a good size
its a lot easier
have you ever had it crack or break or leak
no
no
not yet
$unc$fifty-five gallons youd hope it would never do that
thats right
i really do
but
do you have all kinds of different fish
or
yeah
i just have what they call community fish guppies and platies and basic things
uh-huh
i dont get into the
real exotic
right
right
the expensive ones
theyre probably harder to take care of
and
they are
theyre very expensive
and when they die its more like an investment
yes
i bet it is
you lost an investment
so
do you have problems with the fish eating each other
no
not really
only if theres baby fish
right
you always have to isolate those
then you have to
how do you isolate them
you get a
a jar or something
or
no
they have breeders
okay
its a little plastic things that sort of floats
okay
and you put the mother fish in there
and then its got a trough underneath her
okay
so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough
and theres a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother cant get to them either
oh
and thats
it kind of works
but its also got slots in it so the water can circulate
right
itll fit out the slots
itll go through the slot
thats right
but it works i guess
that works all right then
they dont want the mothers to be with the little fish either
theyll eat them
they will
yeah
isnt that odd
yes
you wouldnt think that
and its funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
youre kidding
no
all the time
and i
and shes supposed to
her variety it says they wont eat the babies
and ive seen her do it
so
and that just makes you sick almost doesnt it
its ter-
it makes you understand that things are different
things are different in the animal kingdom
we might decide whats proper and what isnt
but thats the way it is for them
yeah
thats kind of the way they do it
yeah
thats it
survival of the fittest or something
yes
because if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
right
go hide from them
and then you think how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that
yeah
yeah
yeah
but if youre like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
no
not really
i try
i play a couple of instruments
the $unc$cowboys are my favorite team
thats pretty easy to say nowadays
lot easier than it was a couple years ago
but they had a big win today
did you get to watch it
no
i didnt
i have been at my computer all day
so
oh
are you a $unc$cowboy fan
i used to be a real big $unc$cowboy fan
and im not a $unc$jimmy $unc$johnson fan
being an $unc$okie i just really dont care much
right
yeah
its kind of hard not to be a $unc$cowboy fan though
uh-huh
theyve always been my favorite
right
and i guess i still have a soft spot
yeah
i just hate that thats the coach thats leading them
right
right
so now have they
theyre in the playoffs right
yeah
they made it to the playoffs finally
just $unc$two years ago they were $unc$one and $unc$fifteen
they won just $unc$one game
and so pretty fast turnaround
but this year they made it to playoffs
and today was the first game
and they beat the $unc$chicago $unc$bears
so everybodys really going crazy down here
ill bet they are
theyre going crazy
so they turned it around
but they have a lot of young exciting players now
everybody was real upset when they fired $unc$tom $unc$landry
but now its like theyre doing good so everybodys forgotten about that
football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
uh-huh
hit a bad season
and its the coachs fault
lets dump him
right
first good season the coach can do no wrong
right
exactly
but $unc$dallas has always been good ahead heading good players and both running backs and defense
uh-huh
right
yeah
they have a young team
its a lot different than the teams they used to have where its the same old players every year and same coach same everything
so now its like a taste of something different
theyre all not mister nice guys like they used to be
now its tough and dirty team
so everybody is really excited
and
who is the competition going to be
its supposed to be the $unc$redskins but we beat them already
we beat them this year in $unc$washington
so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the $unc$super $unc$bowl
but its just that we have to play every game away
its going to be tough
but every-
the competition are teams that theyve already beat this year
so $unc$atlanta theyre in it too
and we beat them
and $unc$detroit we play them next week
but we should beat them
everybody feels like we should be able to beat them
so everythings looking real good
$unc$course i think you cant really go by what happened earlier in the season injuries that heal
uh-huh
right
or injuries that have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played
right
right
yeah
the $unc$cowboys are on a roll
theyve won i think $unc$six or $unc$seven in a row now
so theyre supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs
so
but since you have an $unc$o $unc$u drop out as a quarterback
right
yeah
$unc$troy $unc$aikman
he got hurt at $unc$o $unc$u
so he transferred to $unc$u $unc$c $unc$l a
he really didnt feel like hed be able to do a lot of passing at $unc$o $unc$u
right
$unc$o $unc$u has always been known for their running game
uh-huh
more than
theyre playing tonight in fact
right
im watching them on t v right now
but theyre doing some stomping on $unc$virginia
i tell you
theyve not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts
really
theyre doing good tonight
are they
yeah
i havent been watching
theyre winning $unc$forty-one to $unc$seven
good for us
yeah
right
oh
but yeah
and thats right
$unc$aikman did go to $unc$o $unc$u
i forgot about that
yeah
they h-
then he went out to southern $unc$cal
is that where he went
yeah
$unc$u $unc$c $unc$l $unc$a
yeah
yeah
but the $unc$cowboys did good today
i was proud
i thought they would get beat today because theyre so young
playoffs
you bet
they tell you our topic
pets
youve got it
do you have pets
yes
we do
my wife and i have a dog that soon be $unc$eight years old
and we have a cat which is i guess about $unc$five years old
my goodness
how about you guys
we have $unc$three dogs and $unc$two birds at this point
$unc$three dogs
and $unc$two bi-
what kind of birds do you have
parakeets
no kidding
enjoy them
have a ball with them
you let them out and let them fly around and everything
no
because my dogs chase them
okay
so in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages
you-
this is like a cruelty joke
and i apologize if youre a bird lover
but we had a parakeet and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it
uh-huh
uh-huh
knocked that parakeet right out of the air
we had that happen once
my son had the bird back in his room
because the first $unc$one that we had was his bird
and i had a ceiling fan put up
and the bird got away from him $unc$one afternoon
and that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall
i thought so much for the bird
it killed him
no
hes still alive and kicking
thats
it killed ours
ill be darned
no
i guess we didnt have it high enough or he didnt get hit in just the right spot
but it threw him up against the wall
and he slid down the wall i hate them
speaking of pets ill tell you my kids are older now
both of them are either in or out of college
but my son had a burmese boa constrictor
and that thing grew to be $unc$seven and a half feet in length
and finally my wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didnt really like it
we also had a
$unc$one year down in $unc$florida on a vacation for fathers $unc$day my kids years ago maybe $unc$ten years ago bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop
itd been deactivated as far as smell and everything
my goodness
and we had that darn pet skunk for about $unc$five years
and my son left went to school
we finally sold his boa constrictor
but my son needed some money
and we sold it for about $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty dollars
youre kidding
so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk
so i made him a deal
i said you take that skunk
and he said ill sell that snake to you for $unc$two $unc$fifty
i said otherwise im going to give it to this other man
so he took the skunk too
and the skunk was a decent pet
but does his little jobbies in the litter box
and is
thats pretty good
and it was sort of a neat
but they just stink too much
yeah
yeah
that was sort of fun
i tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover
i use to visualize my wife
many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck
youre kidding
oh
and the skunk would be sitting at her feet
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa
and a dog would be running around crazy
my gosh
i can not ima-
i dont
in fact my brother has a exotic pet shop out in $unc$california
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail
im going dont do that because they wont come in my house
gosh
my son bought this snake
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school
and it was just a small thing then
but it got to be pretty big
and you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that
uh-huh
its just too much
that snake used to watch our cat walk around
i always told my wife
i says your friends going to get our cat $unc$one of these days
my gosh
my gosh
that is wild
i just cant do those and the lizards and all those things
me neither
they need to stay outside far away from me
were down to a simple dog and cat now
and thats the way it should be
and
yeah
havent had any parakeets for quite a while
birds
customer of mine has a parrot
and gosh sticks in my mind he paid $unc$eighteen $unc$hundred dollars for a parrot
and that was just mind boggling
yeah
they are so expensive
my son was just dying for a bird
and im really allergic to them
so i try to stay away from them except ive gotten real attached to this $unc$one
are you
and we went down to $unc$canton $unc$one time gosh $unc$two or $unc$three years ago now
uh-huh
and hed saved up his allowance and picked him out a bird in a bird cage
and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you
yes
clamped onto my finger and would not
i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage
and he has tried to bite me for $unc$two years
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends
gosh
he gives me kisses
he talks now
thats neat
and its just hysterical
im the only one that pays attention to him
why sure
and im a substitute teacher
and $unc$one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my moms making me get rid of the bird
we have too many pets
i thought yeah right come tell me about it
come to my menagerie
they knew the sucker when they saw one
so now we have $unc$two parakeets
yeah
okay
so you enjoy camping
yeah
yeah
like you i havent done any in quite some time except for what i call living now which is very close to camping
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
is it
uh-huh
yeah
i camped in the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
and my dad and i went out sometimes
but even my first $unc$eight or $unc$nine years of working i camped almost all of the time because i was in construction
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress
yeah
when you have to have it you have got to have it
uh-huh
and in those kinds of situations room rent which is outrageous
uh-huh
yeah
so my buddy and i we just camped
uh-huh
and we figured what the hell
we did it when we were kids
and we loved it
uh-huh
of course we didnt really rough it that much
when i was in high school
he is a couple years older than me
and he graduated and went off to college
and during the summer we would camp out at the lake
uh-huh
but it wasnt very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove
yeah
i had a little boat house and floated it out on $unc$lake $unc$grapevine
uh-huh
and it was fantastic
we would get up in the morning go skiing
that substituted for a shower
uh-huh
and then we would go to work and come back to the boat house at night
and in the afternoon it is still $unc$four oclock
you have got $unc$four hours of day light good skiing left
uh-huh
and it was great
yeah
but now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
uh-huh
do you have electricity out there
yeah
yeah
youve got a phone obviously
actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone $unc$three years ago
uh-huh
we didnt have a phone
uh-huh
they didnt have phone lines
you just couldnt get phones
yeah
and we are third from the end on the electric string
uh-huh
so we are at the end of the mail route
yeah
like i said we are probably as far as you can get from the $unc$seven $unc$eleven and still be in $unc$texas
yeah
i guess so
but right now what we did my wife and i is we got a mobile home $unc$one of these $unc$twelve by forty-eights that got repoed and swapped them a $unc$cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring i would build a house some day
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
im in construction
and i just had this place to shower up while i was you know out here putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in
uh-huh
and i came home from work $unc$one $unc$friday afternoon
and our truck was back
everything we had was in boxes
and my wife said were moving
and i said where
and she said out to the trailer
and i said oh
she said yep
and i said okay
so we have been roughing it out here for about $unc$three years
but it is not bad
we have color t v microwave
yeah
it is not horrible
but its a lot like camping
uh-huh
yeah
i grew up in $unc$california in central $unc$california right in the valley
uh-huh
uh-huh
so it is a $unc$forty-five minute drive to the mountains
so my dad loved fishing and camping
so we would go up
first we went up with a $unc$toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and cooked our hot dogs by the fire or whatever
sure
but then later my mom and dad got a camper
so we have kind of moved up
became civilized
yeah
a little bit in the world
yeah
my mom goes camping
she takes her motor home
shes got $unc$one of these huge winnebagos with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color t v microwave oven
yeah
she just
roughing it for me is going to the $unc$holiday $unc$inn and getting a shower
yeah
but she has a lot of fun
uh-huh
and mostly it is just a way to
she goes to dog shows
uh-huh
she shows dogs
and you can sneak a dog into a motel
uh-huh
but you cant sneak $unc$ten dogs into a motel
no
so she takes the motor home
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
uh-huh
and she
if he would buy her a motor home
so he did
but as far as camping my wife and i have plans to not really camp $unc$per $unc$se but to drive up the highway $unc$one there in $unc$california as soon as we get this house finished
uh-huh
yeah
that will be pretty
i am going to need a vacation
thats really pretty out there
there are a lot of nice places
what kind of vacations do you like to take
weve been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to $unc$europe
so i guess those are the types i like
uh-huh
uh-huh
weve really enjoyed them
yeah
where have you gone there
weve gone to $unc$germany $unc$switzerland $unc$austria $unc$ireland and $unc$england
uh-huh
weve been to $unc$germany twice
uh-huh
but i guess my favorite is probably $unc$switzerland and $unc$ireland
uh-huh
yeah
ive been over there too
uh-huh
where have you been
i even
lets see
mostly $unc$germany and $unc$france
uh-huh
i lived in $unc$france for a year and a half
so i was able
how neat
but once when i had a chance in $unc$france to go on vacation instead of travelling around $unc$france i went to $unc$germany
uh-huh
because ive got relatives there
and i just like it there
thats neat
uh-huh
but $unc$austria i found really pretty and $unc$switzerland
uh-huh
yeah
and i lived in the $unc$alps in $unc$france
so anything in the mountains over there i just love
how neat
yeah
then i finally made it to $unc$england too on my way home
i lived in $unc$africa actually
and on my way home from there
you lived in $unc$africa
yeah
my goodness
yeah
wow
and unless you fly from $unc$nairobi you have to fly through $unc$europe on your way home
uh-huh
so i went to $unc$england
and i really liked it there too
its so expensive over there
i know
its true
thats the $unc$one thing
it really is
its
i love to go over there
but its so darn expensive to go over
yeah
yeah
now you can get some really good deals flying over
but its
yeah
once youre there you still have to spend money unless you know people
i know
just
right
then you can stay with them
and yeah
uh-huh
that helps a lot
yeah
but
theres a lot of places in the states that we havent even gone
uh-huh
id like to go to $unc$hawaii some time
and we made it
yeah
weve at least gone to the $unc$grand $unc$canyon and $unc$niagara $unc$falls
so
uh-huh
yeah
feel like weve accomplished a little bit here
i havent
ive
most of my vacationing in the $unc$u $unc$s has been on the $unc$west $unc$coast
uh-huh
or this summer i went to $unc$colorado
uh-huh
and id love to go to the $unc$east $unc$coast during the fall
the
its
ive always wanted to go there
ive seen pictures
and it looks gorgeous
yeah
we made a trip up the $unc$east $unc$coast
it was in the summer
uh-huh
and it really is pretty
uh-huh
its
both coasts are really pretty
yeah
but i love the $unc$carolinas
its just gorgeous over there
uh-huh
i havent been anywhere on the $unc$east $unc$coast
yeah
i think $unc$tennessee has been the furthest east ive been
uh-huh
yeah
youll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there
yeah
i guess so
yeah
but theres a lot to see here
uh-huh
but i just love going over to $unc$europe because their way of life is just so different than ours
yeah
were so fast paced here
and over there every time wed go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever wed always have to ask for the check
uh-huh
yeah
theyre so leisurely over there
yeah
and its kind of nice to have that
yeah
so the type of vacation youd like
would you go over and spend a lot of time in $unc$one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in $unc$one week
usually a bunch of different places
yeah
probably because you want to see everything
right
see as much as you can while youre there
yeah
yeah
i know
yeah
yeah
how did you like $unc$africa
i liked it
i was working in $unc$cameroon $unc$africa
uh-huh
and its not a place for tourists
theyre not used to having tourists there
so its
uh-huh
youre kind of roughing it
but i liked it
i liked it
uh-huh
the people there are just very friendly
and
what type of work
i was working with an organization that does bible translation
okay
so i was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and what they call survey work
uh-huh
uh-huh
find out where the languages are
uh-huh
so i travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people
yeah
thats neat
yeah
i enjoyed it
so
ive talked to people who have been to $unc$africa
and they
and then of course when that movie out of $unc$africa came out
yeah
but ive always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there
yeah
my cousin came over while i was there
and she came to $unc$cameroon
and then she went over to $unc$nairobi and took a safari around close to $unc$nairobi in $unc$kenya
uh-huh
how neat
so shed always dreamed of doing that too
yeah
thats great
so yeah
so is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
it sounds like weve been to some of the same places
yeah
it does
have you ever gotten $unc$one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list
and their either offering a service
or theyre introducing some new product in the area
and normally when they call youre either in the shower
or youre in the middle of cooking something
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone
yes
yes
is that $unc$one that youre talking about
that was the big one im talking about
i work weird hours
and invariably just about the time im going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone
as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
uh-huh
or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that theyve read probably a $unc$thousand times that day already
thats true
or the ones that are generated by a computer
its just a computer voice that comes on the line
those are the ones that i really really hate too
ive even had some of them
theyre voice activated
and youve got to say hello twice before theyll do anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
sometimes i get them on my answering machine at home
and i hate that when ive got a whole bunch of messages
and i go through them
and most of them arent from anybody at all
what i would love to see done to stop all of this
uh-huh
weve got a thing in this country
you can have your phone number unlisted
uh-huh
and i think a law should be passed to where any of these people
i think its great that freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if theyre going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
uh-huh
yes
i have an unlisted telephone number
but i still get all of those calls
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i dont even understand
so yeah
i do
i really feel thats an invasion of my privacy
i agree with you on that particular subject there
let me see
thats about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious groups or people peddling products
if i wanted their products i would have either gone to the store to bought it
or i would have called for their salesman to come out
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
thats true
living in an apartment complex though you cant really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
but they still come up to the front door and walk around
so usually what i do is ill call the apartment manager and tell them hey theres people coming around
and theyre trying to sell something
or theyre from a religious organization
and i really hate that
i really really do
i had somebody come to the door about $unc$two weeks ago
and gosh it was about $unc$nine oclock at night too
it wasnt even what i would consider family hours
time to start going to bed
and it was somebody from oh what was it the $unc$jesus $unc$christ of $unc$latter $unc$day $unc$saints
and ive read a lot about that particular sect
and i dont particularly care for it
so i especially dont like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
i agree with their right to pursue their religion of choice in whatever manner they want to
but i think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
im on my turf
if i want them there ill call for them
otherwise i dont want to know they exist
yeah
yeah
no
i agree with you there
if they want to choose that particular religion thats fine with me too as long as they dont try and pull me in and drag me in
and i dont like the way that they do it either
and its their mission that they do it
they go door to door
and they go out into the public
and they actually have the teenagers serving $unc$two years you would say like in an army and $unc$two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and i dont know
i just dont particularly care for that at all
and thats $unc$one thing that i feel really strongly about though is people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to try and get me to join or become interested in their religion
because i have my own
the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting
ive even gone so far as to put that
ive got a storm door on the front of the house
and ive put in
i dont know how much clearer it can be
its a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting
i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause i still get
yeah
yeah
thats true
yeah
no
i didnt go that far
but yeah
i probably could do the same thing
i dont have a storm door
but im sure i could rig up something
but i dont think that that would stop people
its like they see that word
and it says go instead of stop
goodness
and then reverse it
and do
that would be technically illegal
it would be harassment
gosh
but i consider an invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats true
thats true
what else
i believe weve pretty much summed everything up
i know
but i remember you talked about something
you started off and said
let me think
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door
you said something else
i cant remember what it was
and i thought yeah
that kind of touched a nerve right there
but we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door
im drawing a blank
goodness
okay
is our $unc$five minutes up
pretty close to it
pretty close
ive enjoyed talking with you
it was nice talking to you too $unc$jim
and take it easy now
okay
thanks
bye
good night
okay
weve got to talk about music
okay thats really when i grew up
and do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind
no
not a seventies baby
so thats really what i like better
is that kind of music
is it disco
or is it like
no
no
no
not that kind of music
but
no
more like rock like $unc$led $unc$zepplin type
okay
so they can get the $unc$doors and $unc$led $unc$zepplin
right
yeah
thats cool
right
and how about the $unc$rolling $unc$stones
sure
sure
i went to their concert last year when they were here
thats when they toured
how about $unc$pink $unc$floyd
sure
yeah
i like them
okay
so then we got some same things
because
okay
i just didnt know that much about music
and i wasnt sure what kind of music
no
its very hard
because in the whole spectrum id rather listen
i listen to heavy metal or classic rock
what kind of heavy metal are we talking about
what
were talking about what they call hard rock
okay
give me some examples
for example lets see $unc$bad $unc$company
what
$unc$bad companys not bad
thats not
theyre like for example $unc$a $unc$c $unc$d $unc$c
yeah
$unc$a $unc$c $unc$d $unc$c
why
have you heard of them
yes
okay
and stuff like that
thats not really hard rock
okay
okay
i guess i didnt really consider that heavy metal
okay
i think when you say heavy metal im thinking about like $unc$cinderella
$unc$cinderella is hard rock heavy metal
i dont really care for $unc$cinderella
but i like $unc$a $unc$c $unc$d cs okay
but for example they have what
but other bands consider it really hard rock
its like brash metal which all they do is they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar
and the guitar is set really low
yeah
no
i dont really care for that too much i guess
and what happens is everybody gets totally into the music
and then they start dancing around
uh-huh
and they just bump into each other
uh-huh
they hit each other with their shoulders
uh-huh
and then you knock people down
and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
is that the kind of music that you like
no
i dont like that music
okay
but thats what they do
thats what some people call really heavy metal
okay
and the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also
really heavy metal is considered the words heavy metal
and you always thought about suicide and killing people and stuff like that
yeah
and just hard rock has
they dont talk about that
they just talk about life in general
right
like queens $unc$reich if you ever heard of them
sure
of course
yeah
youre talking $unc$queen
is that what you said
okay
no
i said queens $unc$reich
but you got to $unc$queen also
okay
right
because
sure
because queen was real popular when i was growing up
yeah
especially $unc$god what is it a $unc$night at the $unc$opera
dont they have a
no
lets see the $unc$one that they have the whole opera singing in the background
oh! right
$unc$bohemian $unc$rhapsody
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
that was great
i heard that the other day on the radio
and i pumped it up
because i just love that song
yeah
that was a real good one
yeah
but they had
that whole record was pretty good
but then they started going downhill like everybody else
thats true
they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that
yeah
theyre still around
theyve got a new c d out
but i wouldnt buy it
because what happens is the old whe-
i like the old $unc$rolling $unc$stones
i dont like the new stuff
of the $unc$stones
yeah
yeah
i agree
thats the ne-
the older stuff is the best of it
the new stuffs kind of more like todays rock and roll which i dont really care for todays rock and roll too much
yeah
for example i used to like old $unc$phil $unc$collins
right
yes
definitely
i agree
and then what happened was that $unc$phil $unc$collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
and then he came out with for example his record no $unc$jacket $unc$required
uh-huh
that was good
but it was on his way of going downhill
because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone
and then he came out with the $unc$invisible $unc$touch with $unc$genesis
and that really
now i hate $unc$phil $unc$collins
i cant stand him
right
because i look at him
and i say you were singing at this time and with these people
and you were great
and now youre singing all this stuff that doesnt matter what you sing or what you record
its still going to be a number $unc$one hit
and so thats what gets me mad
yeah
but did you go see that new doors movie
no
not yet
i guess ive been kind of considering it
have you seen it yet
yeah
i saw it when it opened
was it really good
yeah those guys that criticize movies
uh-huh
right
and they both loved the movie right
uh-huh
they said the musics great
it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that
uh-huh
and then $unc$one of them said everything is great
but im going to give it thumbs down
and they go
but why
because the end is really depressing
and so
oh
the movie is so well made
and the music that goes with it just picks you up
i was born in $unc$nineteen $unc$hundred $unc$sixty-nine
okay
so for me
so you didnt really grow up with that kind of music then
no
but you learn to
its just that the sixties musics got a lot to say
right
i never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too
i was like
no
ive never liked disco
hey
but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants
thats true
thats true
but i was more in the late seven-
i shou-
mid to late seventies between $unc$seventy-five and $unc$seventy-nine was more my era
yeah
yeah
did you go to college
no
im going right now
thats cool
but no
i didnt go then
but i graduated high school in $unc$seventy-eight
okay
so in $unc$seventy-eight rock was starting to get really heavy
and real i dont know
yeah
yeah
disco was pretty much dead by then
yeah
so thats what i mean
disco wasnt really my time
they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression ever in history
so
about music
no
about everything
okay
so its like nothing happened during the seventies
everything happened during the sixties
the seventies i dont know what theyre called
its like
the eighties are called the progressive years or the technology years because of all the computers and stuff
uh-huh
but the seventies got nothing
nobody cared to name it
thats kind of funny
youre right
i never thought of that
the disco years thats what theyre calling them are gone
yeah
i know
can you imagine a big picture of $unc$john $unc$travolta ta-da what is it $unc$saturday night fever
him just standing there
yeah
right
yeah
thats a good example to look for in history
from now on were going to go from $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to $unc$nineteen eighties
okay
what happened in the middle
dont worry
dont worry
youre not missing anything
so
thats true
except for $unc$vietnam
yeah
really
and thats why i guess everybody
you know with
yeah
its like they dont want to talk about that
so they just dont name it
i guess it was pretty bad times
yeah
thats very true
but
lets see
yeah
okay
weve been talking for $unc$seven minutes
so
good
i havent even been keeping track
okay
all right
im going to leave you alone
what are you doing
do you have a family
yeah
okay
i was kind of in the middle of supper
but its not a big deal
im sorry
i just left it
no
its okay
because i didnt
somebody tried to call me last night
but i didnt have my number yet
i just got it today
okay
and so its okay
i told them id be available during this time
so anyway
okay
all right
then have fun doing this
it is not that bad
okay
thanks
bye bye
great
bye
all right
i think the topic was crime in the city
right
i do not live in a city
i live in a real small little place
where is that
its about $unc$thirty miles from $unc$sherman
north south east or west
its north of $unc$sherman
you live almost in $unc$oklahoma
not too far
yeah
thats kind of ironic because i dont live too far from $unc$oklahoma either
huh-uh
you know where $unc$saint $unc$joe is
ive been through there
im about $unc$eight miles south of it
okay
yeah
i had been through $unc$saint $unc$joe
but just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
ive seen those statistics and everything
and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a $unc$million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry
huh-uh
the $unc$iraqis didnt have a lot of high-tech weaponry
but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that
yeah
sure
and they didnt kill as many people in $unc$forty-five days
and they were intending to kill people
huh-uh
that was their job as they killed in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c
i know
i know
i know
i think nowadays people really just murder is nothing to them
i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last $unc$ten years i guess
and ive come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prisons proven not to work just let them go
say okay youre convicted
huh-uh
and just let them go
yeah
and if they get convicted again just kill them
yeah
because most likely that will happen wont it that
i think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society
huh-uh
huh-uh
if someone is known to have been in prison they cant get a job
no
you know
yeah
they cant be accepted into society
if theyre not going to be accepted into society then everybodys going to become sociopathic
huh-uh
and whos to put the limit on it
i was watching a thing last night up in $unc$washington $unc$state
if you get convicted of sexual offenses on a regular basis
some of these guys are $unc$forty years old and got $unc$ten convictions
huh-uh
and theyre still let out on the street after $unc$one or $unc$two years
in $unc$washington $unc$state if youre a habitual sexual offender they just dont let you out
so you serve your prison term
and then you go into the mental hospital
and if youre pronounced cured theyll let you go
huh-uh
they may find a cure for it
but there is no known cure now
so youre kind of thinking
in other words if you do something the first time thats not real bad
hey people make mistakes
yeah
to go ahead and let them go
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then
yeah
use that
or theres other consequences rather than killing them
you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
huh-uh
yeah
at least they might get some benefit in that
and if the people they committed a crime against feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are okay they can free them
huh-uh
but with the technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property
it will just incapacitate them
huh-uh
and you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act
huh-uh
but putting them in prison my $unc$god that doesnt work
no
apparently not
because look how many years theyve been doing that
and look
yeah
you look at places like $unc$turkey
$unc$turkey has the death penalty for just about everything
huh-uh
huh-uh
if you get convicted of drug trafficking they just kill you
you get convicted of heinous crimes they just kill you
theres no $unc$two ways about it
huh-uh
and you look at their society
and the repeat offenders are very few
and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison $unc$three or $unc$four times
$unc$three or $unc$four times
yeah
the way to stop that kind of behavior is two-fold
that is true
i know
yeah
$unc$one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under $unc$seven
i think thats very important
i agree very much so on that
i
yeah
and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason take the kids away from the parents
huh-uh
yeah
because we are what we teach
huh-uh
because thats what our society becomes
we have just a bunch of people
comes
yeah
ive lived in that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work
and these guys they come to work every morning
and theyre stoned to the bone
their so high they could fly up to the top of that building
and they work all day
and they go home
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money
and then they go back to work on $unc$monday
huh-uh
and the kids of these people
sure
they just think thats the normal thing to do dont they
theyre sociopathic
yeah
and i worked in a first grade classroom for $unc$one full semester
huh-uh
and these kids were more foulmouthed than ive ever been
i had $unc$one kid threaten my life
in the first grade
told me that daddys going to whoop me to death
know
and they flipping me the finger and all that
huh-uh
and i just said to this kid
i said you got $unc$two choices kid
you can step into mainstream society
or you can die
huh-uh
because you will eventually be killed
and im just totally aghast at whats going on
i know
i know
i work in school
thats something i do
and it really is
im like you
astonishing what the younger ages know
and they react to what they see at home
huh-uh
if they see violence at home thats what youre going to get from the kids at school
exactly
it really is
and thats kind of sad
you can see it in the work place
used to be when you had a personality conflict you worked with it
and you got through it
huh-uh
now people get fired
or whats even worse is they promote them into a position that they cant handle and let them get fired
yeah
or $unc$one thing or the other
you look at another kind of society like the $unc$japanese
you put that many people on that small of a space theyve learned to live together
okay
its in their culture
huh-uh
and $unc$one of the things thats in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while $unc$japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at $unc$sixty-five as they did when they were $unc$eighteen
$unc$teen
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people
if they werent fit for the job they were hired for they didnt just can them
they made a position for them some where
huh-uh
you look at $unc$frito $unc$lay
my wife used to work for $unc$frito $unc$lay as a typist
transcribing stuff into the computer
huh-uh
she could type about $unc$one-hundred and $unc$five words per minute
but she dont like it
she just doesnt like to do that
she will
yeah
but her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
what kind of hobbies do you have
i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time
really
i like cross-stitch too
i love it
i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately
thats my case also
ive got a new born
and theres just no time
uh-huh
have you been cross-stitching long
several years
my husband is even interested in it now
he likes to help me design projects that are a little more customized
really
he looks at the pattern
and he says how do you get that from there to the material
not that hard
its not
i really enjoy it
uh-huh
i do a lot of my own patterns also
yeah
in fact i did $unc$one $unc$bill the cat from $unc$glenn $unc$county that was a real good one to do
yeah
it was tough
but yeah
do you have any others
or is this mainly cross-stitching
i do mostly that
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff
uh-huh
yeah
but now i dont know
im still trying to get all the $unc$d $unc$m $unc$c colors
really
yeah
ive got the kits to put them all in
i dont have them all yet certainly
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
i got to counting the other day
and i think i have what was it $unc$two $unc$hundred
and i got to thinking the money that ive got invested in this is
it can add up quick
yeah
i just keep an inventory of what i currently have
and then when i start a new project i go through and see if i
just buy the colors that i need of what im low on
uh-huh
right
i see
now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead what comes close because a lot of them are similar
uh-huh
yeah
a lot of times you can do that
i think i
the pinks theres like $unc$forty-two different shades of pink
good grief
yeah
theres lots of pinks and greens
pinks and greens
yeah
theres lots of shades of greens
but the colors
i just love all the different colors
yeah
they had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to
but you dont have much spare time either
not lately
i just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there
yes
and that does take some time
and if were trying to get acclimated with having a baby
and
yeah
how old
hes $unc$seven months old
yeah
and just into everything
so theres not a spare moment
but i wouldnt trade it for the world
ive been trying to do some bibs for him and work on his $unc$christmas stocking
yeah
yeah
we missed it last year
so hopefully this year hell have one
yeah
last year he was a little bit young for having one
right
he wouldnt have enjoyed it anyway
you would have
but
right
if it tasted good yeah
all he liked was the lights this year
so
yeah
thats neat that you like cross-stitching also
yeah
thats kind of strange that we got the same call
yeah
its a call
im sorry
go ahead
no
thats okay
okay
but yeah
ive been doing it for probably $unc$ten years or so
wow
no
i just started about $unc$five years ago i think
but it is peaceful
it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it
uh-huh
theres also a couple of large projects baby afghans
and i got $unc$one done
and i think the child is going to be in high school before i get finished
on that
bear thing
is it $unc$one of those afghans that ive seen in the packages with the large squares
yeah
i bought the cloth and the pattern for it
i didnt buy a kit
uh-huh
ive seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching
uh-huh
its that cloth
okay
its cloth i think
uh-huh
and it has the borders and everything already
yeah
those are pretty
number $unc$one turned out just great
and the lady said she couldnt believe that they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the nursery
and i didnt even know it
thats a
i gave it to her
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used
i said didnt
that was a good
it worked out that way
thats great
that
now ive got the material to do an afghan that i just never did get around to finishing it
uh-huh
i like those
those are pretty
yeah
$unc$lilly she said its for your daughter to use
no
she said i know she doesnt get to touch it
she hung it on the wall
yes
my grandmother made us a couple of quilts for the baby
and i was like i dont want to mess those up
yeah
theyre just too nice
you dont get many hand made quilts anymore
yeah
yeah
true
ive enjoyed this
okay
but keep up the good
keep up the cross-stitching
you too
all right
thanks
uh-huh
bye bye
bye bye
i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music
and none of them are recent right
uh-huh
i like $unc$gordon $unc$lightfoot
do you know who he is
yeah
and the $unc$moody $unc$blues
and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
and $unc$willie $unc$nelson
uh-huh
you like a variety
yeah
sort of easy listening because you like country
but then
but not all country
i dont like that when they start
i dont know
i just like $unc$willie $unc$nelson i guess because hes such a character
uh-huh
yeah
i like some of his songs though
theyre not so sad country all the time
theyre just kind of sweet sometimes
yeah
theyre not the typical country where theyre just my wife left me my dog left me
my truck is broken down
yeah
my trucks broken down
and my house just burned down
yeah
but
theres a guy
have you ever heard of $unc$george $unc$winston
he plays piano
no
i think hes dead now
but he plays wonderfully
uh-huh
i like that
do you play the piano
is
or you just like it
very badly
ive got a piano
yeah
my mother got a piano
and vowed that someone in the family was going to learn
so we all had to take lessons
and i was the one that did the least poorly
so she gave it to me
and its sitting here mostly taking up space
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it
it is real relaxing
yeah
it must be fun to be able to play it
and if you can play tunes that people can sing along to itd be kind of fun i think
yeah
because i play the flute
and not many things you can play people will sit there and sing along to
and you cant sing along either
but i like a lot
i like classical music just because of the
when i dont play
i like jazz music
but
so do i
whats that
forgot about that
whats that
i said so do i
i forgot about jazz
yeah
i like a lot
i like is it the $unc$new $unc$age music with the
i dont know if youve heard $unc$neurotic $unc$collection
yes
weve got about $unc$five of those
i love them
yeah
i love those too
theyre just so relaxing
uh-huh
id never heard them before until i went in a music store
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
yeah
and i heard a piece
and it was just so wonderful
yeah
and then even my $unc$eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
isnt that nice
its nice when you have a piece that is so peaceful that everybody likes
yeah
and it has pieces that are uplifting
but its mostly relaxing
and because it doesnt have words you dont feel like theres anything you have to remember as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
but
you can just sit
you know those little booklets that come along with it
yeah
and you can just see the things that theyre trying to show with music
yeah
my little boy has gotten so into it that
hes identified the people that have written certain songs
then he buys the pieces that have that person on it
yeah
i see what youre saying
yeah
i dont even know who did which ones
but he does
i cant identify them either
i just like them
i know which ones come next
but i dont even know their names
most of them i dont know their names of the song
but i can identify them
but i like that
and course i like classical music
yeah
and
were you in the band
i was in the band
yeah
so was i
and i was in chamber music groups and stuff
so im used to pieces
and i played classical flute
i didnt play jazz flute or anything like that
so i can relate to it i suppose
and im like you i like the older stuff too
because i like $unc$chicago
yeah
and i like let me think who
you dont know $unc$hebert $unc$laws
but $unc$hebert $unc$laws a flute player
hes a jazz flute player
and i like $unc$chuck $unc$mangione
do you know who $unc$chuck $unc$mangione is
yeah
yeah
i like $unc$chuck $unc$mangione
trying to think of all
whats his name plays the trumpet yeah
i like the $unc$moody $unc$blues
did you like them
yeah
i like $unc$moody $unc$blues
i like mostly the older groups i think
c-
but we do have
i like $unc$simply $unc$red
we got $unc$simply $unc$red
i figure all our c ds that we have what i really like
and i like $unc$breeze
i like the group
i think just because they sound a lot like $unc$simply $unc$red
what type $unc$simply $unc$red
ive never heard of that
is it just instrumental
no
its got people singing
but it is instrumental
but its got people singing
but its got a whole bunch of people singing
yeah
you know how many people are in $unc$simply $unc$red $unc$stuart
he cant hear me
i dont remember how many people
but its got men and women
and its nice
i mean its pleasant music
its not where it hurts your ears to hear it
but its not like $unc$chicago where its got that much instrument to it
it doesnt have all the brass and everything
yeah
yeah
my husband is telling me we have to hit the road
were going to go to $unc$commerce and see a friend
and then im going to go to $unc$sulphur $unc$springs
you must live in this area
yeah
where are you
were in $unc$sherman
okay
were in garland
okay
youre going to $unc$commerce
yeah
for $unc$east $unc$texas or something
yeah
yeah
okay
just because theres a friend up there
not because theres much else
okay
theyre having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas
thats why i was just w-
for colleges
yeah
$unc$east $unc$texas is recruiting for their fall semester
theyre not c-
and theyve been doing a lot of that in the area
theyre not going to recruit me anymore
im through
no more for me
no more
what do you do
right now im just a homemaker
but im going to school for legal assistant
and thats what i know
and just nothing basically
are you going to go to $unc$east $unc$texas for that
no
no
it
no
i dont go to $unc$east $unc$texas
i got a degree from $unc$t $unc$w $unc$u
but im really interested in the legal environment
but i dont want to be a lawyer
so i said i think ill go back to school and see about being a legal assistant
thatd probably be pretty interesting
i was summonsed down to the courthouse last week
they had summonsed $unc$eight $unc$hundred people
about $unc$four $unc$hundred showed up
and it was for a murder trial
uh-huh
this guy had supposedly strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose
anyway this is happened in $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-three
yeah
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire
we stayed till about $unc$one $unc$thirty
and theyre going to call the ones that theyre interested in from the questionnaire $unc$two to $unc$three at a time
and the trial wont take place until $unc$june
yeah
thats how it works
and they say its going to last about $unc$two to $unc$three weeks
and this guy in front of me said i cant believe i was summonsed
i was an investigator
and i was tailing the woman that was killed
then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend thats a lawyer
and he said that this socialite in plano had hired $unc$four guys to kill her husband
and the one thats accused was the one that actually did it
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been getting cocaine from his client and then selling it
and he had skipped bail
and they finally extradited him
and hes going to testify for the $unc$state against her so hell have his sentence reduced
and this is the man that was in front of you
yeah
well theyll weed him out
the investigator
yeah
he got off right away
yeah
and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that hed told me that
uh-huh
so i figure that that will make me biased
and i wont be chosen
not necessarily
hopefully
but theres probably something else that might make you
because you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury not be accepted for the jury
yeah no
pretty much a lot of people would know about it and know some of the different things about it
but they might weed you out some other way
if you dont believe in death penalty youre not going to be picked at all
but
i said that i could believe in it in certain instances but id find it hard to levy that against somebody
yeah
there they would have a doubt about you that
uh-huh
because if thats what the punishment is in that instance then youre always going to say not gui-
youre not going to want to have him have that punishment
so
yeah
but then when youre picked
i was picked for another murder trial before
uh-huh
gosh and its so hard because everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done
and if youre trying to hold out theres so much pressure on you
and youve got to come up with a decision
especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt
you have to find whether theyre guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
and its like do you really feel that sure about
okay
personally i dont have any children
im $unc$twenty-two
and im doing my masters at $unc$n $unc$c $unc$state
uh-huh
so children wouldnt be very convenient for me right now
no
would they
no
how do you spend the time with your children
both of mine are boys
theyre $unc$eight and $unc$eleven
okay
and did
and theyre into sports
yeah
as a matter of fact thats what were doing tonight
what are you doing
baseball has started
okay
does the $unc$eight year old play baseball
yes
we start here at $unc$five
okay
and in his league do they have a pitcher
or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what
up until
its coach pitch until you get $unc$nine which my little boy will be $unc$nine in $unc$may
okay
so hes going to be with regular pitching
okay
and my $unc$eleven year old of course is pitching
yeah
i used to play soccer when i was that age up in $unc$new $unc$york
uh-huh
so
but yes
were into baseball
and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball
we even have peewee basketball here
theres always something
yeah
and how about on the weekends
do you do sports
or do you go out
both
if were not doing sports we go somewhere
do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off
yeah
yeah
yeah
in the summer or like in the $unc$easter time like around now
no
usually in the summer time
and where do you go
different places every year
we
have you been out of the country
no
okay
first they always say get to know your country first before you leave
i lived in places
uh-huh
when i lived in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c i never went to the $unc$washington $unc$memorial
and then when i went back to visit i went to the $unc$washington $unc$memorial
ive heard we have a couple of friends that goes to $unc$washington quite often
and that must be the thing
they really hadnt either
they went to the memorial
when they go its on business
right
its not really just getting to sight see
right
its a beautiful city
i bet it is too
but the problem is first time i went out of here they took me to $unc$las $unc$vegas
uh-huh
and that was the most boring place on earth
now my husband and i we go different places
but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
yeah
did you go to $unc$disneyland
yes
yes
yes
okay
but i dont know
but lets see
when i was $unc$eleven i went also to the $unc$caribbean
oh
and then after that i
my sister lives in $unc$turkey
so when i was like $unc$fourteen $unc$fifteen i went to $unc$turkey
and this $unc$christmas i went to $unc$turkey
but basically its a
for the past couple of years i
since my parents are
im from $unc$argentina
and my parents live down there
so all the traveling i do is alone
uh-huh
and we were never much of
a very family thing made go skiing in $unc$vermont or something
uh-huh
that was a lot of fun
yes
but what happens is we used to fight a lot
so theres never much of a family thing
$unc$one of those hell family vacations
yes
but i try
my husband also were involved in everything our kids does
yeah
because my dad died when i was less than a year old
yeah
so i always just had a mother
so i always thought when i have kids i really want to be involved with them
my dad all he wanted to do was get money for us
so he could buy us material things
material things
yes
that is
yes
and to me its now im $unc$twenty-two
but i still feel
its we never threw a football or something
uh-huh
and the way i was brought up
and he wants me now
he wants to be best friends now
best friends now
and its very hard for me
because its like you grow up to be $unc$twenty years old
and its always the same man
uh-huh
and then suddenly he sees that hes getting old
and he wants to be best friends
yeah
but its like i can only express myself so much
because everything that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from $unc$one year to the next and say im sorry
its i love you
and lets go out and do things together when i dont feel like it
uh-huh
and so thats that whole thing that hell say when
ive seen my uncle and his family does everything together
and his kids are
when his little girl was $unc$five years old and everything they would go to the beach
and she could go to sleep at $unc$two in the morning
uh-huh
yeah
and i was brought up the same way
it doesnt matter what age you have
just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up
uh-huh
but what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house
yeah
you have to
yeah
you honestly do
now i have friends that i love to death
and they have children
but their children does anything
we have to take them to do it
yeah
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
because youre saying i work full time too
yeah
yeah
but its just something that
my theory is when you have kids and all you want to do
what ill do is
you might have problems
but its not your kids problems
yeah
yeah
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can
and to
thing is that if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
problem
uh-huh
and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time
yeah
first of all youre coming to me
and lets see how we can get rid of the problem
and thats very hard to do
because once youre best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
uh-huh
yeah
i agree with you very much so
now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college
and we knew time wise and money wise too
yeah
it would not have been a good idea to had them then
yeah
my father was raising $unc$three kids before he had me
so it was
youre trying to support $unc$four kids
and its pretty hard
yeah
and i told him listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had $unc$two kids
uh-huh
yeah
he says yeah
but then i wouldnt have you
i go yeah
but then you would have a lot of money
thats right
but you cant take this money with us though
yeah
thats how i keep looking at it
but $unc$four children is expensive especially for me which im paying out of state tuition
im paying $unc$three $unc$thousand
no
what is it $unc$two $unc$thousand $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars for $unc$one semester
oh
and people say its expensive to think its college
but if everybody would be a little bit responsible
its
what does it cost
it costs $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars a semester suppose
now they go to a state college
and they live at home
uh-huh
and it costs $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars for books
but $unc$seven $unc$hundred dollars a semester
a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead
yeah
if you can
yeah
its like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up $unc$seven $unc$hundred dollars $unc$one $unc$thousand $unc$four $unc$hundred dollars to send your child to college
yeah
what are you learning to be
excuse me
what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
im doing computer engineering
thats
my husbands into computers
yeah
and now im looking for a job before they have to send me back home
uh-huh
because since im an international student they want to send me back to $unc$argentina
yeah
my dad wants me to go back
so
and you dont want to
no
no
no
no
because if you go back there then you can never get out
oh
you dont have any money to get out
oh
and i was thinking oh my $unc$god i go back there
and i get married there
and now i have kids there
and then ill never leave the place
then youll never leave
yeah
i know
and thats what happened to my brother
he came to school up here
and then when he went down there
he was just so bad off from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain
uh-huh
so
maybe something will open up for you
yeah
ive been calling a lot of companies
there
some of them are interested
at least for a year and a half i can work
uh-huh
so
may-
ive enjoyed talking to you
all right
same here
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
all right
on this subject i really hadnt had to deal with putting someone in there yet
but my mothers always been administrator of a nursing home
uh-huh
so ive always been involved in one
how do you feel about them since youve kind of been close to that
i can kind of see both sides
i really can
nursing homes to me
i would personally be the last resort if i had to put someone in there
uh-huh
ive had a touch of experience
my dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldnt take care of him
yeah
if its a have to thing
yeah
i
yeah
and she put him in
but he wasnt there very long before he died
uh-huh
but i guess the $unc$one time that i saw him there as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
uh-huh
but we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of keep him real out of it all the time
yeah
yeah
and thats always kind of bothered me
yeah
uh-huh
thats like everything else though
i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home
but ive never actually been there
uh-huh
and i know that shes the kind of person who wouldnt allow a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
yeah
yeah
but
but still im sure there are aspects to it that arent really desirable
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know
ive always
my sisters involved in one also
and i really think they really do a wonderful job
but still theres those little things that happens
yeah
there really is which
i think its a wonderful place if it comes to that if you just cant take care of them any more
sometimes you dont have any other alternative
uh-huh
thats it
familys tied up with their own lives and things and usually working
uh-huh
other things
and its hard to
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i think when the time comes i hope to have the time to really look around and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at
yes
uh-huh
i think thats important too
in fact theres a
i do too
outsides awful deceiving sometimes
yes
theres one close to where my mother is
but in order to get in you have to be able to walk in on your own
in other words you cant be in too bad a shape to start out with
yeah
yeah
but then if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care all the time
ca-
yeah
yeah
but its always
and they have a long waiting list too
so theres always this feeling of golly gee youve got to be able to walk in the door
so you cant wait until youre too bad off
off
yeah
but then you dont want to go do that when you dont have to because you have to give up your automobile or whatever
to
no
uh-huh
and everything you worked so hard for all your life
yeah
yeah
and if youre still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like gee im isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
uh-huh
uh-huh
so thats a hard one
but it is a very nice nursing home
now there is some really nice ones
theres also some private ones
uh-huh
but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that
yeah
thats the problem
thats way out of my reach
the expense of it all is
and another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into $unc$one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
yeah
but those who dont have money can go in and get the same care
uh-huh
the very same
yeah
so i dont like that aspect
no
but i think theres ways around it though that
they could put it in $unc$one of their childrens names or something
yeah
but still a lot of them doesnt feel comfortable doing that
its their money
thats right
thats how i feel about it anyway
yeah
ive talked to my mother about that several times lately
and i said i want you to have control of your own business
yes
but what if
yeah
my mothers $unc$seventy now
so naturally shes retired
but shes still on her own
yeah
yeah
my mothers $unc$seventy-five and still has her own home and everything
i think thats wonderful
i really do
just as long as they can
and then on the other hand ive seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy
yeah
thats true
they have a lot of people around to do things with
uh-huh
theyre not lonely
some of those places have wonderful activities and things lots of stuff going on
yes
uh-huh
and theyll take them places
yeah
i dont know
its not all bad
no
but i guess once you get ill then you really have some problems if you cant get around and do things
around
yeah
but i really dont know what the other solution would be
no
i really dont
but no
when the time comes hopefully well really look around before i decide on one for my parents
uh-huh
really do
because i have been raised in one
so theres lot of things i know to look for
yeah
and i dont think theyd want to go where they used to work either
yeah
i really dont
that might be kind of tough
it really would
yes
yes
and like i said my sisters still in it
and i really dont think my motherd want to be there either
its been nice talking to you
you too
and i guess wed better get back to work
okay
all right
bye-bye
bye
in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first
all righty
i have a $unc$four year old who will just be entering public school next year
so im really just starting to get involved in whats out there and how they do things
as far as the system as a whole i really dont see a problem with it
i do see a problem with graduating people that cant read and are not productive in society or productive to themselves
and i think thats the main problem at this point
how about yourself
all right
i live in $unc$plano $unc$texas
and today were not even suppose to be in school because the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isnt any funding for the school systems in $unc$texas today
uh-huh
right
when you take professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education
and they cant get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line
somethings wrong
so i think here in $unc$texas mainly that theyre not serious
theyre more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children
i have a $unc$one year old
so im more opinionated about the observations than the true facts
but its just a shame to me that our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the $unc$three least paid utilities that have the biggest impact to our well-being
uh-huh
thats true
i have a real issue with that
i think that if from every year when they pull in the test that the last $unc$three years $unc$ten $unc$eleven $unc$twelve graders take
and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all $unc$fifty states
theyre not saying that somethings wrong with the educational system here in $unc$texas
i have a real concern about that
as a matter of fact im very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in $unc$virginia verses having her go down here and not learn anything
uh-huh
so i think theres a big concern
hopefully the new secretary of education will do something to fix the problem
but i dont know
theyve got to quit worrying about the religious overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
yeah
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that special interest groups can blow up and not really get down to teaching whats important
uh-huh
teaching these kids really the basics is what it comes down to
exactly
i was astonished to find out that across the $unc$united $unc$states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed
is that right
the kids nowadays dont even know what the presidents fitness education program is all about
they dont have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school
i remember
and yeah
and i talked to a $unc$thirteen year old last night who goes to $unc$one of the $unc$plano high schools or junior highs i guess
and she said that she had a choice
she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting
so she choice to take weight lifting over the regular gym
give me a break
the kids sit there
and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for lunch
and then go out there and lift weights and dont learn anything
and talk
yeah
i have a real problem with the whole system
they need to put some sternness back into the teachers and let them be able to get the old whip out and get some discipline
yeah
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public service employees that there are
uh-huh
i used to date a girl who taught $unc$english at ninth grade level
and yet theyre so important
uh-huh
i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid
true
she was young
but still its the principle
right
of course if she got her masters degree it would all be different
but
its hard though because then you start talking taxes
and thats a bad word
taxes lord forbid taxes
goodness gracious if we would plan our expressways a little better that $unc$ten dollars for the bridges and the roads wed cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem
theres an idea
maybe i should run for office
run on that then no income taxes in $unc$texas
thats true
im in $unc$texas too
so
thats funny
thats funny
thats about all i have here
me too
i think we both agree theres some problems there
but well maybe do our small part to fix them up
maam
surely
ive enjoyed it
all right
you too
bye bye
bye
do you have any hobbies
right at the present time nothing real special
i kind of like gardening
and im kind of into camping and vacationing that sort of thing
yeah
i dont have any real serious
im an avid gardener
okay
i think youre
i consider that a hobby
i dont know
they were suggesting handcraft things which
uh-huh
i guess thats a really true hobby
but i think anything that you enjoy
yeah
yeah
it doesnt really have to matter
it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
really
yeah
i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too
no
i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation
i dont know
i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car
its not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong
i says you go pay to have someone do it
yeah
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening youve still got a couple months to go havent you
yeah
right now we start our seeds inside
uh-huh
yeah
thats right
you would
yeah
well start them inside
and
in cold frames or whatever the
yeah
we usually start them right in the house
uh-huh
my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck
and a wind storm come and knock it down
but shes had really good luck
ca-
next month
actually if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of $unc$may
you can leave them outside
uh-huh
you might put them in the ground just the first week of $unc$june
yeah
but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of $unc$may
yeah
ive lived in $unc$texas and $unc$new $unc$mexico most of my life
but i did once
i spent $unc$one winter in $unc$north $unc$dakota
oh
and i remember that it was on into $unc$may before it really started warming up
and
yeah
we live really close to $unc$lake $unc$champlain which is in the $unc$champlain $unc$valley
yeah
so were about $unc$two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
so
okay
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit
yeah
yeah
we are a little lucky
my brother lives $unc$ten miles from here
youre at
and he gets frost
and his crop gets killed
yeah
youre right across the lake from what $unc$plattsburgh
yeah
from $unc$plattsburgh $unc$air $unc$force $unc$base
yeah
yeah
but
yeah
i had a cousin that was stationed there $unc$plattsburgh for a while
he remembers lots of snow
yeah
plattsburghs kind of a
its depressed economically
really
when you go across the lake
i dont know why we have so much going for us
i really dont
im just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at $unc$digital
and theyve had layoffs recently
but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never
and now were looking at serious
im a technician
yeah
when they start getting rid of technicians
yeah
im working for $unc$t $unc$i $unc$texas $unc$instruments down here
i interviewed with them
yeah
but i didnt want to go to $unc$texas
even though my mothers people are from $unc$georgia
oh
yeah
yeah
i guess we have to get back to hobbies since
yeah
were getting to where were straying i guess
stick on the subject
yeah
interesting thing that i do is with gardening
my sister grows flowers that you can dry
uh-huh
and you can make dried flower arrangements
and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun
and we made some really nice $unc$christmas wreaths with dried red flowers and dried white flowers and eucalyptus
yeah
what eucalyptus is
its
yeah
yeah
its sold in the hobby stores and nurseries
yeah
its got a s-
its got a kind of a peculiar smell to it
but
yeah
at first im why do people like this
but it is kind of a nice smell after a while
people put them in
yeah
i didnt realize what it was for a while
id walk into a room where some of that
and id wonder what is that
and then $unc$one day i realized that it was eucalyptus
its like a fad thing
i dont know
ive never heard of it
in the last $unc$five years ive used so much of it that
yeah
i hate
is that the stuff that koala bears eat in $unc$australia or something
yeah
it is
maybe thats why theyre so slow
i guess theyre stoned on the stuff or something
yeah
it looks really potent stuff
yeah
yeah
but i think its the greatest stuff in the world though
its jeez
i make all kinds of things with it
we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers
i almost want to start a business doing it
but im so timid when it comes to starting a business
yeah
thats a big step
yeah
yeah
it is especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end
yeah
after a while you make some stuff
then you start looking at it
go boy this is kind of ugly
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby
he does it believe it or not i wouldnt imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
because hes a seasonal worker
he works in the construction
and up here its almost a pattern
and you see your fathers do it
then their sons do it
what they do is they work construction
then they get laid off for like $unc$twelve weeks in the winter
and this guy was going nuts
and his son built him a garage and got him some i dont know what the equipments called but planers and things and set him up
uh-huh
shapers and planers and routers
and he makes all kinds of furniture for his kids
and he makes little kids furniture
he gets right into it
and
there was a program on t v down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little companies of $unc$one and $unc$two guys up there
this particular one i think was in $unc$maine and $unc$new $unc$hampshire just kind of out in these little towns theyd be in
they may be the same kind of people youre talking about
theyve got $unc$twelve weeks to do something
and theyre making furniture and just things like that during the winter
and then they go off and do other things during the summer
yeah
its a really good thing because its keeping him sane
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
plus its keeping his marriage
yeah
plus hes getting on in his years now
hes not that old
but hes getting to the point where he needed an extra boost to do something like that
yeah
and its hard work
i couldnt imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it
he dowels everything
that would be really t-
the
man
yeah
and its all got to line up
its
and i dont think he goofs too much
i dont see too much scrap around
yeah
yeah
thats something
now our temperatures down here were starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties
god im envious
so as far as planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i was planting some trees out back tonight
and its really nice out tonight
is it going to be really dry
almost hated to come
are you
now i always plant trees in the fall
i dont know why
the cold weather can kill them
yeah
these were trees that wintered
but i guess
i dont know where they came from
they come out of nurseries mostly in $unc$missouri and places like that
and they come down here
and theyll sit in the nurseries here
and theyll go ahead and leaf out
so what im planting or actually transplanting is trees that are already leafed out
thats good
i guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all
yeah
mostly i think in a place where its really cold they do it in the fall
let them winter through the fall
yeah
but down here its done both ways
it just kind of depends on what youre planting
but all the shrubs and
yeah
and when you have time to do it
yeah
my sister does flower gardens
she gets right into it
uh-huh
she spends lots of money on them
and i guess a lot of people do do that
they landscape their whole house with flower gardens
yeah
shes got just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn
yeah
during the summer down here the normal kind of flowers theres very few of them that will really do well
everything does real well here in the spring until about first part of $unc$june
and then the heat sets in
it gets ya-
and $unc$june $unc$july $unc$august are
most of those kind of plants are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers
do you have a lot of shade trees around your house
or is it
were in a relatively new area
were kind of out of the natural tree area
were kind of up on a slope
you dont have a lot of tree coverage
so we dont have
where we are right now there are very few trees
because going to make
this was pasture land
but down the hill here a little ways there are parks that look like jungles
theyre really
yeah
my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees
uh-huh
and they just shade everything
now where is this
its in $unc$georgia
in $unc$georgia
yeah
yeah
its right outside of $unc$macon
and its just a
i like the way that idea of the south is
but when i think of $unc$texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass
i tell you what
$unc$east $unc$texas
theres $unc$two parts of $unc$texas $unc$east $unc$texas and $unc$north $unc$texas
$unc$atlanta and $unc$dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
yeah
the $unc$two cities are very identical
so if you were familiar with $unc$atlanta
its that dry heat
no
its not dry at all
its humid
where is it
wasnt it houstons humid
$unc$houston is awful
yeah
$unc$houston is really humid
no
its humid
ironically enough im sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last
no
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle
gosh
yeah
so
exercise is not supposed to do that to you
thats what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way down the hallway
do you do anything on a regular basis
off and on
off and on
right now ive been off
but ive been going over to the fitness center
yeah
thats a good
yeah
my husbands a $unc$t $unc$i in the unit here
yeah
$unc$three times
i try to go over there at least $unc$three times a week
and i try to walk at least $unc$five times a week
do you when you go to the
i have to ask you
and if this is getting to
were not supposed to get too particular
but im just curious
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the $unc$dallas location or the $unc$spring $unc$creek in terms of its so much of a weight orientation weight lifting $unc$et $unc$cetera
yeah
ive been going to $unc$spring $unc$creek
i havent been to the $unc$dallas one now in a couple of years
uh-huh
at least since theyve supposedly redone
so i dont really
yeah
its not that great
and i go to the $unc$spring $unc$creek one on and off
but my husbands working over there
and he just goes to the $unc$dallas one
but i just dont
its just so much weight lifting
even the $unc$spring $unc$creek one has a lot of weights in it
yeah
thats true
or is that what your into
or
no
no
ive used the $unc$nautilus equipment and the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly
uh-huh
yeah
i dont use the free weights
but
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there
yeah
i like those too
and the pool when it gets warmer
and the pool
yeah
thats great
yeah
i know
what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in $unc$richardson near where we live in $unc$north $unc$dallas
and long story short i hadnt
this is really a stupid thing that happened
but they have like the gymnasium flooring
and then they had about $unc$three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand in any class like that i go to
uh-huh
instead of having that level they had a chrome strip that wasnt level
uh-huh
and it was about $unc$four inches deep and then about oh a $unc$seventy degree angle
my goodness
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it
the orthopedist called it a basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped
woo
i know
we went to whatever in $unc$plano
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
and the doctor said you didnt do anything
theres only a $unc$one in $unc$five $unc$hundred chance that the radiologist will call you
that was $unc$tuesday night
and $unc$wednesday night the radiologist called me at work
and i was on crutches
and he said i think you better call an orthopedist
so we went to $unc$one
and he just put a big old cast on it
put a big cast on it
yeah
for about $unc$four weeks
$unc$four weeks
yeah
i like aerobics
but im not so sure that
not that much though
no
ive never
i was off for about $unc$six months too just for some other surgery id had
but i was pretty much in shape walking
and this is $unc$one of those things
like this orthopedist said he said youd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
yeah
i was real embarrassed
but i felt kind of stupid
those things happen though
yeah
they do
i guess im glad that nobody really noticed
i guess you could say
yeah
because i got up and started jumping on it again
that did a lot of good
im sure
yeah
really
i enjoy aerobics
and i do it because i like it
i like the music and that kind of stuff
yeah
i like the music
but ive been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about $unc$five years ago
i broke my heel no
oh
that makes my foot
howd you do that
in aerobics
no
actually i was up on a ladder and fell off leaned the wrong way
goodness
uh-huh
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete
whatd they do for that
did they have to cast it
yeah
they had to go in and do surgery
they put a pin in it
so the impact would not be good
yeah
as i permanently damaged the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there
goodness
uh-huh
i cant do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt
that makes sense
so are you in terms of other things like not running but playing a little bit of tennis can you not do stuff like that at all
i havent tried that
i dont know
i bet its been $unc$thirty years since i played tennis
yeah
its been
mostly into just walking and stuff like that
thats probably the safer way
because i notice in aerobics a lot of the women that dont look like they shouldnt be doing certain things
uh-huh
im always afraid theyre going to fall over and have a coronary
yeah
and there was my ego when i went ahead
and i went i can do that
and half the time though i dont jump half as much as
uh-huh
im real tall
and im not heavy
but when you go easy a $unc$hundred $unc$seventy at my height im $unc$five $unc$eleven you need just take it easy
sure
but when i see some wo-
and i just dont think its healthy
all that pounding all the time
its not really good for your knees
yeah
thats the other reason
and i dont know
this was just i guess something freak that happened to me
because i wasnt familiar with the
the floor was uneven
it was completely
it literally
the $unc$two dissimilar floor coverings were not level
and at first after it happened i thought maybe thats a handicap access
and then i said no
thats just the way its constructed
yeah
and my husband being a $unc$t $unc$i engineer
i said a few things to him when i got home
i said who has engineered that
really
but i
sounds you like
$unc$one thing that i like swimming you like that a lot
uh-huh
i like swimming
uh-huh
do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to
no
i liked it because i want to
it makes me feel better
thats how i am
yeah
yeah
if i dont do it i just feel like i dont have as much energy
uh-huh
and its real funny because if you
it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that youd be tired
but its the other way around
right
it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff
yeah
really
yeah
but
yeah
and i need all the help i can get
that gravity factor
i know
uh-huh
it does get you
like that orthopedist said to me he said dont worry $unc$diane
he said youre at $unc$thirty something
but youre on the upper side
he said that dont worry
he says even if you werent doing anything that would start to happen to you
yeah
thanks a lot
yeah
because i said im not that heavy
im not heavy
maybe $unc$ten to $unc$fifteen pounds like any other human being
uh-huh
i said why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more
and he goes human nature
and then you see these little girls in these little bitty things
and theyre all like $unc$twenty-one years of age
uh-huh
but luckily at theres a little more diverse clientele
thats true
they do
except for the guys that lift the weights
they do intimidate
yeah
i try to go real late or real early before they get there
yeah
there some things id like to try
but sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
uh-huh
thats $unc$one thing i like about the $unc$spring $unc$creek place
at least $unc$one of the fellows thats there at night and on weekends is real helpful
uh-huh
and his name is $unc$b $unc$j
i think ive
there was some girl there
ive been there maybe a dozen times
uh-huh
but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
uh-huh
its terrible
i dont know if the $unc$dallas location
it just seems that
sometimes i feel like im in a singles bar
yeah
yeah
thats true
and i havent noticed that up at $unc$spring $unc$creek
no
i havent either
and i just
its not that far of a drive
and im glad they did that
youre not missing anything at the $unc$dallas renovated site
its not at all anything worth talking about
yeah
yeah
i thought maybe $unc$one of these days ill drive over there and check it out
yeah
but if you dont live near there thats not worth
yeah
i live in $unc$richardson
but its about half way between the $unc$spring $unc$creek and the $unc$dallas site
yeah
thats actually where this happened to me out in i say $unc$plano
but its all the same to me
$unc$richardson over on $unc$campbell and $unc$park $unc$hill theres a new recreation center
uh-huh
and as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities
walked out
i was $unc$one thing
great i have purple tights on
uh-huh
and theyre going yes
but in general i like dance a lot
so aerobics is something id hate to give up
but he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot
but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling
or
yeah
you probably will for a while because its going to be real tender
he told me $unc$eight to $unc$twelve weeks
uh-huh
not anything
i said but youre only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks
he said yeah
but thats just
they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker because he doesnt like to put casts on when its warm
but i just
the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed
i couldnt adjust that
i know what you mean
more about this stuff than i do obviously then
not fun
no
youre walking okay now obviously
and you can
yeah
i have a slight limp from it
but it matches $unc$one if i have $unc$one on the other side
yeah
anything else about exercise we can talk about
other than i need to go
yeah
me too
me too
i need to go actually get something to eat here
its great though
i really do enjoy it
okay
thank you $unc$sandy
sure
thanks
uh-huh
bye-bye
i dont know
do you do a lot of camping
my husband and i havent done a whole lot of camping
but we bought a van last year
yeah
and we were hoping to do some camping in the van
we did go camping in $unc$oklahoma
last year we camped in a tent
and there were $unc$two other couples with us
and there was state park
so
and it was really nice
yeah
up here some of the state parks are really nice
and some of them arent
some of them are pretty rough
really
yeah
they just have outhouses
they dont have a shower room or anything
yeah
but some of them are really nice
they have showers and full bathrooms
but i dont know
ive been camping a couple times
but im not a real avid camper
a lot of people i know are
but i dont
i dont like really camping in the rough
i like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
yeah
we went once to a lean-to
and it
there wasnt any electricity on the camp site
but it was all right
we only spent $unc$two nights there
i wouldnt want to spend more than $unc$two nights
i wouldnt want to go for a week
but $unc$two nights is good
yeah
that would be much
especially there was a little store close by
so it was pretty nice
yeah
the campsite that we went to was an area that
its right on a big lake
and theres a lot of boating out there
and we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit
but it was still too cold
really
oh
yeah
it was pretty early in the year
yeah
up here you got to wait until $unc$august until the water warms up
yeah
its not that bad
but its still pretty chilly
i dont know
i have a tent
and i fluff out in it in the backyard and stuff
but this thing about camping that bothers me is youve got to pack everything
and another thing is the thing seems to get
its dirty
yeah
so you cant keep the dirt out of the tent
i dont know
we have a $unc$seven year old
its pretty funny
stay out
yeah
we have a dog
and thats just about as bad as a kid
yeah
boy he doesnt go in and out of the tent a $unc$hundred times and use it as a play
uh-huh
they like to play in them
yeah
i dont know how you can really keep the inside of a tent clean
yeah
i dont know
other than taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday its really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it
yeah
what were just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so no going in and out or what he wants to do
we had brought his friend along was play in the tent
it was like no this is not working
you cant do that
you get the tent all dirty
did
plus you get it all wet
we were at a beach site too
uh-huh
did you have a big tent looks like a sitting area type like a $unc$two room type
no
but i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice
and up here we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime
yeah
yeah
we dont really have a problem with that in these areas
and in $unc$oklahoma when we camped i really didnt notice a problem with bugs
and i noticed that
i know that i said thats
ive lived back east before they
theyre terrible
theyre really terrible
but theres this one campsite that it
just some of them are known
but there is $unc$one thats out in this big lake
and its mosquitoes are terrible
and then theres this other one thats more up in the mountains
but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
and theres no bugs
thats the whole thing that everyone told me
i was going to go to $unc$little $unc$river $unc$state $unc$park
that place is great
theres no bugs
but
okay
because we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas
we were really affected bad by it but really got it
almost destroyed the tourism in $unc$one town because of the mosquitoes
theyre so bad
really
yeah
its a really nice area
ive been there before
and its
i couldnt imagine living just $unc$sixty miles north of them
but they were plagued with mosquitoes
and you can go outside in the daytime all right
but thats when its usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
just the very second
its really strange
they must work on that
it gets cooler when the sun sets
and then they all come out
have you ever taken any of those what do they call this lights
have you ever used those
yeah
yeah
i never really noticed how effective they were
but because that wasnt really
i bought them
i really didnt get to use them like theres mosquitoes lets turn them
we just sort of lit them
uh-huh
and we werent bothered that much by mosquitoes
so we didnt really contribute it to that
but i think in an area thats really thick with mosquitoes
i cant see all this little smoke buckets i call them
yeah
they work
but theyre suppose to work really well
im in my paperwork here
thats what i do when i wait for a phone call
i get in my paperwork to find my most important parts
but i dont know if im going to go
i wish was an avid camper
and i could really talk about like gardening or something
you can talk about that a lot
uh-huh
but i do want to go again
we just moved into a house
so i dont think camping
maybe in the backyard
but i dont see going on a camping trip probably until next summer
yeah
id like to go camping cross-country
i just got married less than $unc$two years ago
so we dont have any children yet
so its easy for you to go
yeah
so easy to pick up and go and s-
we have a van
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
god
its not really i guess camping the way most people picture camping in the tent
but
i dont know
but that sounds my kind of camping it really does
yeah
okay
that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent
yeah
or get
my brother has a real nice pop-up
yep
and he just tows it behind his truck
and hes got $unc$three kids
so his kids will sleep in the truck in the back of the bed
and they sleep in the pop-up
theyre kind of nice
but theyre also flimsy when you really look at them
but when you get inside theyre really nice
yeah
everythings really
but then when you look underneath them its just got these little wheels and this little axle
its like my
and then a big windstorm it would pick you up
yeah
he did have a problem when he went camping last year in $unc$beavers $unc$bend $unc$oklahoma
a storm came in
and it started raining really heavy
and everybody was trying to flee the campsite
everybody was getting stuck in the mud
jeez
and
yeah
what do you do when you get a really violent storm like a tornado
just stay in your truck
i wouldnt stay in the
theirs was so bad
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up
oh
and they had to get out of there
then were they successful
yeah
they were
but it took them a little while
but yeah
they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend
yeah
did they get stuck
no
they ended up getting out
they ended up helping several other people though that were stuck
yeah
so they evacuated it
yeah
yeah
the whole campsite was evacuated
wow
i think some people that had fairly sturdy vehicles or whatever if they had like a $unc$winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed
yeah
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up
it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream
i know i like to get right on the water
yeah
by the campsite its so
yeah
we have lean-tos up here
i really like them
like i say theyre just kind of more sturdy than anything
just
they have them right at the campsites
yeah
theyre lean-tos theyre pretty nice
wow
its like a little house except the whole face is open
and the $unc$one time that we went we got $unc$one
it was overlooking the water
but it was a big embankment
i wanted to get $unc$one right on the water
we had an electrical storm too
and it was neat sitting there watching it
it was raining
when we called home everybody said we were worried about you in that storm
all right
i have a lot of different teams that i like to keep in touch with
of course $unc$texas $unc$rangers being $unc$one of them
you cant live in $unc$dallas without
well what are the others
i originally came from $unc$saint $unc$louis
so the $unc$saint $unc$louis $unc$cardinals are $unc$one
i moved to $unc$kansas $unc$city
i have a tendency to adopt teams when i go to a town
its helpful
yeah
so i lived in $unc$kansas $unc$city for a couple years
and i adopted the $unc$royals
i lived in $unc$houston for $unc$two and a half years
so i adopted the $unc$houston $unc$astros
so ive got quite a few
do you keep up with the statistical stuff
no
i dont get into that too much
every once in a while i will keep in touch with maybe whos in the top $unc$five of hitting or something like that
but i dont get into how many errors somebody has or things like that
theres a guy that was on show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does
uh-huh
its essentially trivial statistics
uh-huh
but theyve got a st-
its a statistic that has to do with winning and losing $unc$one run games
ive heard of that $unc$one
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of $unc$one run games
i didnt know that
thats supposed to be a real good statistic
it is
but its a reverse indicator
thats true
they dont have the offense to get out or to have the more runs
so
what the argument is
and its $unc$one of these statistical
gee how can you draw a conclusion from it
but they find that theres a connection between that and how they do in $unc$spring training the following year
uh-huh
and strangely enough its almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
which means that if you have a good year winning $unc$one run games that the following year youll have a bad year
and theyve looked at i think $unc$twenty-three teams
and the statistics are something like $unc$twenty-one out of $unc$twenty-three
it was
which means the $unc$rangers are going to have a terrible year
i
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth
and its
i dont know
what do you think of incaviglias loss
i kind think it was necessary
im not a big pure power hitter anyway
i dont like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time
i think that a player ought to hit a home run if hes got the pitch to do it
but when you get $unc$two strikes on you you should shorten your swing a little bit
if its a perfect shot go for it
but the strike outs were a big problem for him
plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway
so
its an interesting concept though when you look at how apparently
i was reading in the paper tonight that the $unc$detroit $unc$tigers are going to sign him
and the point of i guess
i dont understand the strategy of how baseball works
but it seems that they can sign him tomorrow
uh-huh
and he could go in the team the next day
and they put him in the lineup
and he hits a home run
and all of a sudden he becomes a hero
yeah
thats true
and all he has to do is hit the ball
youre not a-
and all he has to do is hit it once
it doesnt
he can swing a couple times
if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can
right
its an interesting concept of how they do it
but i agree with you
i think thats part of what baseball needs more of
i guess what bothers me is that when you go you wait and wait and wait
and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
and thats all the game is
id rather see the ball hit around and have the people
yeah
theres another point to that too
they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run gives you run obviously
yes
but if you cant do it with men on base theres something definitely wrong
youve got to be able to get the $unc$two and $unc$three run home runs to be able to score enough runs to be able to win in this day and age
so
yeah
well how do you think the $unc$royals are going to do
i think the $unc$royals will do okay
they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
and theyre these cycle pitchers
they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good
$unc$saberhagen has won supposedly the $unc$cy
i think he won $unc$cy $unc$two out of $unc$three years
so hes very much due for a good year
are they going to beat $unc$oakland
thats a good question
i dont know how oaklands going to react to being swept in the $unc$world $unc$series last year
they could very easily take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally do and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them
yeah
so
i go to $unc$saint $unc$louis from time to time
and i watch their sports up there
and theyre certainly intense about the $unc$cardinals they
uh-huh
yeah
baseball is their life up there like football is down here i think
did you actually live in $unc$saint $unc$louis
i lived in the suburbs of $unc$saint $unc$louis
yeah
everybody does right
yeah
thats true too
i think thats all that they have
i had a friend from college that lives in
its i should say on the west side
everythings on the west side
$unc$manchester
uh-huh
out that way
and i went and visited him
but anyway it is interesting
how are the $unc$cardinals
do you still keep up with them or someth-
yeah
yeah
i definitely do
in fact ive got family that still lives up there
what i hear from everybody up there theyre not going to have a good year because they let too many people go
but ive been following $unc$spring training
and theyre $unc$one of the best teams in spring training so far
is that a good indicator
it can be
it really kind of depends on what they were looking for
in other words if in $unc$spring training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do then it really doesnt give you any indication
but if they were playing the people that theyre going to play then that might be pretty good indication
so its not a great indication because there have been teams that have just come out and just won all kinds of games in $unc$spring training and then gone on a $unc$fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
so
what i think is remarkable is
it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years
exactly
yeah
and the question is how do you forecast that
you cant
if you had to bet on who would be in the $unc$world $unc$series it would be really tough
right
i think the best thing that you can do is go with the players that have the talent to do the best years and that they hadnt had these gigantic career years yet and just kind of assume that $unc$one of them is going to break through eventually
yeah
and i think they said the $unc$reds
this last year im not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
yeah
and so they may be even better this year
when are the $unc$rangers going to come through th-
thats a good question
i
the $unc$rangers have a pitching problem
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question
theyre doing the right thing though
they are going with their farm system
theyre letting their farm system build up and stuff like that
and
is there enough money
thats part of it
i
that was part of $unc$skip bayless argument
uh-huh
i dont know if you read $unc$skip $unc$bayless a local commentary
no
and his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars
uh-huh
thats probably true
would you agree with that
considering what ive seen in the last $unc$two seasons im beginning to agree with that
yeah
but you dont have to spend the big money as far as im concerned to win
you just have to spend it if its necessary
in other words if youve got a player on your team whos helping your team then keep him there
dont let him go away
yeah
and i think thats really whats been hurting the $unc$rangers
didnt $unc$kansas $unc$city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
yeah
they spent more money last year than any other team in the league
and they were toward the bottom of the league
so its like i said spending money doesnt guarantee you winning a pennant
yeah
it really doesnt
so
and i think thats maybe part of it that the
and it
if i owned the team i think youd like them to do well
but the question of losing big money that did $unc$steinbrenner actually make money on the
you got me
i think that theres coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan cant go
and once you do that you lose everything
its a little bit like any other sport
when it starts costing you $unc$fifty or a $unc$hundred dollars to go to a game
uh-huh
and i guess as we get older youre probably going
if you compare to go to a sport a
you go to a rock concert or even a performance an opera or the symphony or something
uh-huh
if i-
but how often do you do that
right
an
i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there several times a
thats the whole point
there are so many games in a year that theyve got to have repeat customers
yeah
they cant afford not to
and thats $unc$one of the things that i think $unc$saint $unc$louis has done
their ticket prices are i guess as high as anybody elses
but somehow or another they attract so many people from its a small market
and yet they attract as many if not more than most other cities
so
yeah
but dont you think there are older fans there
i dont mean older
the fact that its a better established and that the city is more of a
okay
what baseball team are you familiar with
im only a little bit familiar with the $unc$red $unc$sox because i lived up in $unc$boston for a while
really
and thats
come on
no $unc$texas $unc$rangers
after that if you asked me that i wouldnt have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball
really
i guess they paired $unc$two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later
but i understand a little bit about the $unc$texas $unc$rangers
i know $unc$george $unc$bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground
and that
yeah
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he didnt design the patriot missile system
and the radios kind of cruel
think this chain that must have been on $unc$president $unc$bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground
how humiliating for a man to do that any man
i dont care if youre $unc$president
yeah
but at the same time i dont know its pretty far to throw that far
i couldnt do it
i know
but hes a man
come on
men know how to do that right
right
hes supposed to be able to do that
i know so
i felt kind of sorry for him
that must have been hard on him because hes just a person
but i never
a major owner of the team here
really
i didnt know that
yeah
i thought he was the owner
but it turns out my $unc$mom said that hes part owner
but he must own the biggest chunk
because thats all you hear about is about $unc$neal $unc$bush i think is his name
uh-huh
i even know his name because hes on the news a lot
and i never had to watch the news not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
yeah
and ive been watching
my husbands $unc$french
and so if ive been watching the $unc$french news when i watch it
uh-huh
its incentive
were going to get a little off topic but speaking of $unc$bush that had a story where he went to visit some little elementary school students and stuff
i saw that
did you see that where the guy asked him for proof of who he was
yeah
he said his
i want to see your drivers lic-
i dont
i know
and see a credit card
youre not $unc$president $unc$bush
i know
and he said
yeah
it does so fast
i heard it on the radio
i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car
but i didnt see it
but
it was so funny to see
it was a really cute little kid too
thats about baseball
i dont know that much about it
i can tell you that the $unc$mets opened i think $unc$two days ago
uh-huh
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game
and i couldnt tell you who pitched
uh-huh
but they won
the $unc$mets won
did they
but yeah
not my a lot
and then somebody else lost
maybe it was the other $unc$new $unc$york team which is the $unc$yankees
uh-huh
but i dont even know if theyre still $unc$new $unc$york $unc$yankees or $unc$new $unc$jersey
thats so stupid that you all have $unc$two teams
yeah
thats really stupid
but it
then they can have them play against each other
yeah
i know
i think its still the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$yankees
yeah
i thought they were moving to $unc$new $unc$jersey
this is how much i know about baseball
the $unc$texas $unc$rangers they lost i think
uh-huh
but i know that last year
we did go to a baseball game last year
we got free tickets because $unc$one of the deacons at church parks cars at the $unc$mansion at $unc$turtle $unc$creek which is $unc$one of the places and stuff
uh-huh
and hes their head chauffeur
is this funny as theyre parking the cars the valet service
right
yeah
he makes good money too doing that
i was shocked
but anyway someone gave an $unc$iranian a tip of $unc$four $unc$rangers tickets last year
uh-huh
and then the $unc$iranian couldnt
he didnt want them
so he gave them to $unc$alan
and $unc$alan and his $unc$dad had plans that night
so they gave them to us
he decided that some wealthy man tipped this $unc$iranian with baseball tickets
with baseball tickets
and we ended up with them right
and so we were walking up
yeah
and i looked at my husband
and i said what $unc$kyle this is the $unc$mansion at $unc$turtle $unc$creek a tip
i bet these are really good seats
and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor
wow
yeah
they called us at $unc$five
and the game started at $unc$seven
so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and walked
and so we took $unc$two kids with us
and nobody brings $unc$two children in these seats because
because theyre fancy seats and stuff
yeah
and you just sit down
and all the girls were all dressed up
i just was there
like im loaded
im here
and it was just kind of funny
but we got to sit by first base
if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in
i know im always scared of that whenever i go to a game
i rarely go
but we went last year
because my brother is impossible when he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
and if theres a game on hes watching it
thats all there is to it
really
and hes glued at the t v
im glad my husbands not like that
im glad my husbands not like that either
id kill him
my brothers like that
and he goes to a lot of games
not a real lot
but he tries to go
then my father got us some tickets
uh-huh
so my brothers wife and my husband and i went
last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because being a non-american you want to see what a baseball game is like
uh-huh
and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd
it was nice weather and stuff
it wasnt a real problem
but you sit there in a crowd
and youre waiting and waiting and waiting
and you eat the hot dogs
because we made him try a hot dog
thats funny
so you sit there
and you wait for the longest time really bored
and then all of a sudden something happens
but you happen to look the other way during the time
you miss the whole thing
yeah
and so basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
and when it happened he missed it and didnt understand it he grew up in which is the sort of o strip east to west eastern part
thats funny
where is he from in $unc$france
uh-huh
but that
yeah
i had a friend in college from $unc$strasbourg
yeah
hes not that far
he was sort of in between $unc$strasbourg and $unc$paris
uh-huh
$unc$paris
and my cousin lives in $unc$paris
and shes lived there off and on for $unc$twenty years
is she still there
uh-huh
because
$unc$saint $unc$claude is that sound familiar
yeah
$unc$saint $unc$claude
yeah
yeah
we used to
thats $unc$one of the entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city
really
and it sits right at the limit
uh-huh
i exactly where she is
but we met in $unc$paris
thats neat
yeah
she married
and they have $unc$twelve children
$unc$twelve children
she has $unc$twelve children
my $unc$god the poor woman
she looks gorgeous
no
shes gorgeous
and she just liked having kids
and shes thin
and $unc$four or more children are thin
were any of them twins
im not kidding you
you probably cant afford to eat if you have more than $unc$two of them
no
your
i have a friend now that has $unc$seven
and theyre all $unc$nine and under
uh-huh
theyre all real young
theyre just raised right
thats what gods told them to do
but theyre not condemning you
if you
we only have one child
they dont put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy im sure for them to do that
you get a conviction like that
and you think everyone should have it
and so im real proud of them because they dont do that at all
uh-huh
you go in their bathroom
and theres $unc$ten tooth brushes in there
and i always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
but how do they afford to even have the kids
were expecting our first baby almost any day uh-huh
uh-huh
they live lean for $unc$one thing
and they tithe
and they
it puts a whole in your money bag
we dont honor $unc$god with this portion
and so they
i think that helps a lot
i think thats the key in his sales last year
he just works a normal job
he probably has an income of $unc$thirty-five $unc$thousand
but last year he made
that got him a bonus of $unc$twenty-five $unc$thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van
he loves $unc$god
it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
wow
and he got to do it
and so $unc$god just really blesses him in ways like that
do trust $unc$god because i dont know kids are a blessing
and we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that
but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things
but its a different kind
and a lot times people think im not blessed
i have an old car
but youve got $unc$five kids
uh-huh
youre just as blessed probably more because if you follow this
theres a good book called what the $unc$bible has to say about child training by $unc$richard $unc$fugate
uh-huh
and hes
a lot of wisdom in it
and the kids at $unc$bible talk about anything
and training is different than anything else
psychology doesnt address it
the good stuff thats in psychology it just comes out of the $unc$bible
and they dont quote you the proverb out of it
but the things that work in psychology other the years that theyve proven to work they just come out of the $unc$bible
and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child
so theyre not going to be a curse to you when theyre $unc$thirteen
uh-huh
how to train them so theyre going to be a blessing
and so they do that
and they just live lean pretty much
she doesnt shop at foleys and stuff like that
but a lot women die or shop at foleys
so things
i dont know what foleys is
its like a macys kind of store
uh-huh
its pretty nice
and everythings pretty expensive
and you just cant do that
and you dont go to baseball games as much
or you get pictures like we did
what i mean
yeah
you do these fun things in other kinds of ways
and i know manhattans real expensive
but its kind of a different situation because youre probably living in an apartment right
yeah
that makes a really big difference
but still its just as hard as having that
yeah
but your cousin could have a baseball team with $unc$twelve kids
church softball leagues
so
uh-huh
theyre not all boys
and right now we dont have a girls league because im the $unc$one thats supposed to start $unc$one
and i just havent gotten around to doing it
i keep saying we need to have one
they go okay then start $unc$one
but everybody wants to do it
but gods sitting on my heart
and i just hadnt gotten around to doing it
so they could really only have $unc$four members on the team
i think they only have $unc$four boys
i dont even think they have but $unc$two old enough to play yet
uh-huh
but then you didnt believe me about her kids
they are so good
im not kidding you
but she does work with them
and its a commitment
and thats what theyre called to do
uh-huh
i have a
most of my friends
i admire someone that can do that
i really can
i know
i do too
most of my friends have $unc$three or $unc$four kids
and they feel like thats really why $unc$god
and some of the people in our church use birth control
and some of them dont
i had my tubes tied
so you
this is a good subject isnt it
yeah
its something that you can really talk about
yeah
i dont know what were going to do about it
but its certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about
uh-huh
when they say the $unc$middle $unc$east its such a big area
uh-huh
and theres so many different problems there
what do you want to concentrate on
it doesnt matter to me
ill tell you something
i have a sister-in-law from $unc$israel
uh-huh
and theyre really quite arrogant about it all
they believe that they belong there
and theyve belonged there forever
and the $unc$palestinians and the $unc$arabs are more or less
they consider them second class
uh-huh
theyre really quite arrogant about it
i dont know if that contributes to the problem
how did they feel about the $unc$united $unc$states intervening with $unc$patriot missiles
did they
im sure this is the $unc$one time that the $unc$israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the $unc$americans
uh-huh
but i didnt really talk about that with her
my sister-in-law now lives in $unc$switzerland
oh
but when they were living in $unc$israel it was the $unc$palestinians they come in and theyre nothing but really servants for them
and they really treat them like second class citizens
they dont really want them around
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such
uh-huh
but they really do
they look down on them
and i dont know being
i live in $unc$vermont
and being up here we pretty much treat everybody as someone that has merit even if theyre poor or if theyre $unc$hispanic or if theyre black
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we dont see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities
uh-huh
if i lived in $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c i think id have a different attitude about black people
because ive heard that theyre terrible
its just like its a dog eat dog world
and here all my black friends are professionals
and they dont go out and abuse drugs
and they send their kids to school
and they really encourage them to go to college and stuff
uh-huh
so its just a different world
i live in $unc$san $unc$antonio
and $unc$fifty percent of the population is minority
i talked to someone about $unc$san $unc$antonio
uh-huh
and they said that you have quite the problem with the ghettos
i dont know
do they call it the barrio down there
thats the barrios
but i dont think its any different of a problem than any other major city
its just $unc$hispanics here instead of $unc$blacks
yeah
but i heard that like a city like $unc$san $unc$diego it just has a really bad problem
i grew up outside of $unc$houston
and as far as gang violence and things i dont think its any worse here than in $unc$houston
yeah
like $unc$houston
me not even knowing anything about $unc$houston i would think that its a pretty calm city
$unc$houston is not at all
no
theres a lot of crime
yes
theres quite a bit of crime
my
yeah
were so protected up here
its really strange
our red light district you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life
uh-huh
and were just so protected
but over in the $unc$mid $unc$east especially $unc$israel its just like $unc$israelis have a totalitarian system when it comes to the $unc$palestinians
the $unc$israelis can do anything they want
but when it comes to $unc$palestinians if theyre out in the street at night its really looked on as odd
usually theyre bussed in to the jewish neighborhoods and the jewish cities
and then at night theyre bussed out to the occupied territories
so they dont have that
but what do you think about the mess weve created in $unc$iraq
i think its unfortunate as far as the $unc$kurds are concerned
it
i thi-
its just what do you do for them
you want to do something for them
but you dont want to get so directly involved that youre occupying the country
yeah
yeah
we cant get involved in their civil war unfortunately
but weve kind of driven these people out
to do it
yeah
but you see $unc$president $unc$bush is telling them rebel uprise
and thats what they did
and now theyre asking him for help
and hes like no we cant get involved
my husband had very strong feelings
he agreed with the $unc$general $unc$schwartzkopf
he said $unc$bush should have let him finish his job
sure
he should have let them corner the $unc$republican $unc$guards
i think the war ended too soon
yeah
exactly
thats what everyone says
yeah
everyone i talk to they says
its real easy to say that
we didnt damage enough of their arsenal
we damaged most of it
but we should have made sure we got everything
yeah
i dont think the higher ups were thinking about what this guys going to do with the rest of his war machine
theyre going its not going to hurt us
so were just going to let them go
but really we didnt think about the people that he was going tr-
and hes just
unfortunately though the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of $unc$kuwait
and once that was accomplished it
they stuck right to their goals
yeah
and right
what they were going to say
and the american people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that
yeah
they were playing it very safe
but it what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth whatever
yeah
$unc$schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
and its too bad that he just didnt have the ability just to do it the go ahead to do it
yeah
because he had the fu-
he knew what was going to happen more than any of us
it was going to make such a mess
i feel really sorry for these people
these people are middle class people just like us
can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood
yeah
and you knew this
these people are going to come
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you
of course youre just going pick everything up that you can carry
and youre going to run
uh-huh
and its just too bad that we couldnt see that
i just have a feeling that the military involvement isnt over yet that i still feel like theres more to come
i dont think this whole issue is settled as far as were concerned
you know what i was hoping
i was hoping $unc$iran was going to take a very dramatic stand and invade
and then irans the big bad guy
but really if they were going to save peoples lives
theyve got $unc$sixty or so of iraqs planes
yeah
i know
its like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
but i almost swear im kind of disappointed with the $unc$iranians
why they didnt go save
i dont know if the $unc$kurdish
i know the $unc$shiites are their people
uh-huh
but i dont know
i think they have a bond with the $unc$kurds
there are some $unc$kurds living in $unc$iran
yeah
i think they should have just done more
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid
its just so complicated
i was real surprised that $unc$israel stayed out of it as much as they did
yeah
you
knowing them theyre very
i dont know
almost compare them to a very egotistical man
uh-huh
youre damn right
im going to protect my family
so i was amazed too
i was really proud of them though that they stayed out of it
but
yeah
and from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
yeah
i
that part scared me
that the $unc$egyptians would pull out
and i just saw atomic bomb
i have i guess a lot of thoughts about the $unc$vietnam $unc$war
i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on
and so theres probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didnt have a clue as to what was happening
yeah
looking back maybe some of the things that i know now im not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives
that was $unc$one of the questions that she asked us to think about
because we never went to war
i dont think we were committed to winning it and getting out
and i feel like it went on and on
right
and i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the $unc$middle $unc$east $unc$war we just had where $unc$president $unc$bush went out and got worldwide support for what was happening
right
i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman
and im not sure thats our role
but
yeah
i agree with that
i was fairly young at the time too
i really dont have very many memories about it at all in fact
uh-huh
and my husband is a $unc$vietnam veteran
and in looking at the $unc$persian $unc$gulf war that just went on he
it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the $unc$vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either $unc$one
dont you think that maybe thats why we had it this time
i do think that its been too long in coming
but i feel like maybe the $unc$american people and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didnt support those
right
so many people were opposed to the war
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it
and those guys were there doing their duty
thats right
they werent there by choice
and
yeah
and i think that we learned from that
and i think its $unc$one of those things that you learn the hard way
it was a tragic mistake
right
the way that they have been treated over the years i believe thats just now turning around just now trying to be rectified
and im not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people
right
no
i dont think you can
and i agree with you that i think that the time difference between the $unc$two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in every aspect of it
and i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war
theyre still not settled over there
no
theyre not
and i have a feeling that the $unc$persian $unc$gulf crisis is going to be the same way
yeah
i think were going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner
i appreciate the fa-
i feel $unc$president $unc$bush is in a hard spot
he went over there to get them out of $unc$kuwait which he did
uh-huh
and then he has backed out
he has pulled out
and i realize theyre still saying here youre encouraging us to get rid of $unc$saddam $unc$hussein
so why arent you helping us
and i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another $unc$vietnam situation
i think it would too
and i dont think the $unc$u $unc$s will stand for it
i dont think he would do that
no
i think we learned too much of the effects
yeah
i agree with that
whether it was justified or not i know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause
i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and beat the communism
uh-huh
but i think somewhere that got lost in the long term effects of the war
yeah
yeah
and
you have to give $unc$bush a lot of credit for he said thats what we were going there to do
and he did what he said
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where it would have turned into more of a police action or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really cant do as another country
yeah
yeah
my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries
and we have so many problems here at home that we dont address
that we dont get fixed
thats right
i know
and thats what frustrates me more than anything
and i believe that we have to have a military
and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us
right
but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward
i think theres a lot of waste
and they dont if they could just cut out all the fat and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues
i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world who just end up using things against us later on anyway
ye-
i know
i do think that in the $unc$middle $unc$east war
i think that maybe a lot of the $unc$arab countries that were so hateful towards the $unc$united $unc$states have come away with kind of a different attitude
uh-huh
i think that maybe were not their big bad enemy any more
right
and i think thats good
yeah
i think thats a good
yeah
a lot of good has come from this one
i think so too
and i guess in ironic way a lot of good came from the $unc$vietnam war toward this war
because like we said earlier a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of that war
and
and perhaps the reason that good came out of the $unc$mid $unc$east war is because we had the experience of $unc$vietnam
right
exactly
so i do think that weve learned from it
uh-huh
i wish there werent war
yeah
no kidding
but i do think we learned
and i just hate the emotional price a lot of the $unc$vietnam people paid for nothing
yes
they still dont know what they were there for
no
there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal
no
no
we went in
but what did we do
we lost lives
and what were we trying to do
who knows
yeah
thats true
and i think youre right
i think youre right there
i do remember when it was over
i remember when they were coming home
but i remember the feeling back then
right now i feel like this country has been behind this war
uh-huh
yeah
theres a lot of people that arent for war
im not for war
right
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right
i dont remember that feeling back in $unc$vietnam
right
i just remember
yeah
our guys are over there
and its sad
and we shouldnt be fighting a war
but there was no lets support them
right
we-
the
when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and all the demonstrations that were going on
yeah thats right
i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity
because theyre the kind of people whove always got to have a cause whether its good bad of indifferent
theyve got to have a cause
and nobody says because youre supporting the troops that youre supporting the war
you have to support the people that are there
thats right
and for some reason those people dont see that
they dont see it as supporting the folks the people
no
no
they dont
and theyre just real shallow people
i would agree with you there
yeah
i agree
and i recall when $unc$president $unc$bush said that
he said look
im sorry that youre opposed to the war
theres a lot of us that are opposed to war
but youre not helping the people that are over there by what youre doing
and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that
yeah
but
theyre not helping anybody
thats the whole point
not
theyre not doing anything for anybody except themselves
thats true
and i dont even know what theyre doing for themselves
giving a soapbox to stand on
yeah
but im glad weve learned
im sorry we had the experience of $unc$vietnam
yeah
and im especially sorry for the people that have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally
because until the past $unc$four or $unc$five years nobody ever really worried about that for them
thats true
yeah
and i think thats where we as $unc$american people really failed them
uh-huh
yeah
i dont know
do you have anything else you want to say on this
no
i guess not
i think this is the first time that i havent been cut off by the computer
i know
we get cut off all the time too
usually i can talk all day
but this is something to me thats sad
yeah
it is
have a good day
and i appreciate the conversation
thanks
same here
bye-bye
bye-bye
the general topic is hobbies
yes
lets hear about your hobbies
lets see
what kind of hobbies do i have
i guess its more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing
i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports
and
any handicrafts
excuse me
any handicrafts
no
not really
no
im really not too creative
i around with my hands and things like that
i leave that more up to my $unc$mom
i think im in handicraft
yeah
i think it will become resume writing
lets hope that you arent employed by that craft for too long
yeah
i hate to think about it
and im getting rather good at reading want ads
uh-huh
yeah
it
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there
i
who knows
is it
basically i had read that theyre just looking at relocating them all to $unc$mckinney is it $unc$texas
no
all means about $unc$fifteen to $unc$twenty percent of
wow
im sure the numbers somewhere classified
but some of the internal news and the news services
so its approximately $unc$six $unc$fifty
uh-huh
so $unc$ten percent of $unc$six $unc$fifty is $unc$sixty-five
and $unc$twenty percent would be $unc$one $unc$thirty
wow
how about that
yeah
thats what it did report was a $unc$hundred and $unc$thirty relocating down to $unc$mckinney
yeah
thats possible
how about that
thats unfortunate
is there many other
are you in the defense
yes
is it many other corporations in the area
i saw $unc$seven $unc$eleven that was hiring
im sure with the new contract awarding
i think it went to $unc$lockheed didnt it
yes
i hear theyre hiring all over the place for that
yeah
no
apples coming to town
and that has some opportunities
really
and
now is that ad good just to $unc$colorado or to $unc$colorado $unc$springs
$unc$colorado $unc$springs specifically
yes
how about that
and $unc$m $unc$c $unc$i coming if telemarketing is your bag
uh-huh
personally id rather die a slow painful death
but
you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing
im a defense worker
im government tool control specialist
right
yeah
thats why i was in the $unc$deseg down here in $unc$plano also
are you still employed
am i still employed by $unc$t $unc$i
no
i took a leave of $unc$t $unc$i back in $unc$november
oh
actually $unc$december was my first month away from them
exempt or
exempt
yes
it was purely by my own choice
there was no incentive for myself to leave
but it was just an opportunity arose
and decided to take it
so you didnt even get the severance package
no
i should have taken the option when that was there
but it was just i missed it by a couple months
but what can one do
im just happy still to have a job
are you happy with what you are doing now
yeah
i am kind of happy with it
its getting better all the time
i knew it would be different from the very beginning
but as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of whats going on with the system
i was in the computer operations
it all starts to become similar
theres benefits
and theres things that werent as good
yeah
but as an overall package id say im pretty happy so far with the way its turned out
good
good
it hasnt been a long time $unc$t $unc$i
or im significantly shaken by the situation but not devastated
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing
and theres lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the defense area but manufacturing in general
to tell you the truth im not really worried
uh-huh
thats great
thats good
and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just to know what might happen
uh-huh
sure
yeah
sometimes its good just to have everything out on the table
but still in all it feels funny
it may be a blessing in disguise
i know a number of people who are surplused
and theyre just
actually the positions that they found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside
so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains i cant seem to get into it right now
exactly
uh-huh
im sure its just with the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass
situational
i doubt ill be here in $unc$six months
uh-huh
would you like to be there
i
all things being equal yes
uh-huh
or even somewhere better
sure
but god this is much better than west $unc$texas
uh-huh
just take the day
but then they tell me $unc$hell is much better than west $unc$texas
actually that whole area is actually quite nice
my little brother lives in $unc$austin right now
thats a beautiful place
goes to $unc$u $unc$t
uh-huh
thats just fantastic down there
take it more as a
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want
pick out where you want to live
and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
thats the problem
for the last many years ive more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go and just kind of go with the punches
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
and now i feel lost
uh-huh
yeah
thats a
it takes a bit of a shift doesnt it
i had job offers
uh-huh
but i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave
and that
uh-huh
the best thing about it is that you can try something
if you dont like it shoot move on to something else
thats the way i would have looked at the whole thing here
ill take a chance
if i dont like it ill go someplace else do something different
had you been with $unc$t $unc$i long when you changed
$unc$five years
yeah
ive been with them $unc$sixteen
yeah
i can imagine the longer and longer it goes
actually $unc$seventeen now
and yeah
momentum is driving force in our lives
uh-huh
so yeah
im looking as a opportunity
thats good
youve got a good attitude about it
and im looking at it as a change
uh-huh
and im looking at it as an adventure
right
there you go
thats the way to do it
and maybe ill wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i dont get laid off between now and then
there you go
thats the thing to do
thats much funner than doing any kind of job
how about we end this
that will work out just fine
nice talking to you
all right
nice talking to you
bye
good-bye
whats the
what does it have it has a death penalty doesnt it
yes
yeah
they just started it again too just late or within the past few years
for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty
but now its coming back into favor
yes
they find it is more deterrent
my sociology class at $unc$s $unc$m us taught us that it was not a deterrent
but thats just what they said
i dont know maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now theyd say it is a deterrent
if you compare the figures i think thats where theyre coming from
maybe theyve changed their minds
the
maybe thats it
maybe thats it
because that was back in the seventies
they are
that was before they adopted the death law again
but i myself am in favor of it particularly for i think $unc$texas has a good law crimes murders related with drugs or killing a policemen
i think
i agree
but i think it ought to be expanded to include children
i think theyre working on something in $unc$austin now
uh-huh
and im not sure what it is
i just remember seeing a kind of a synopsis of it
uh-huh
why stop at children
why not go to adults too
im personally very in favor of it
uh-huh
why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after theyve mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried to or given their best effort at doing that
uh-huh
yep
i dont care to support them
i dont either
but there is something to be said about
or just for the sake of argument im taking a con
sure
im against it
yourself how many times have you heard where a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary
uh-huh
uh-huh
just recently this black man served $unc$nine years was it for robbery
and then there was the black woman that robbed and shot the furrier
and she was set free too just in $unc$two examples in $unc$texas recently
uh-huh
but she actually killed the furrier or someone
she was charged with murder
and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something
i didnt retain all those facts very well
but i know what youre
what if we make a mistake
thats it
and thats not $unc$one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything
uh-huh
right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect i dont think that theyre going to use it too frequently unfortunately
i like you say yes
lets have it give them all a shot get rid of them
i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the persons guilty
why should they be sitting in prison getting their college degree
uh-huh
now thats tougher
its easier to say it on the telephone
and everyone agree that the death penaltys the way to go
its a deterrent to crime
they shouldnt catch themselves in that circumstance anyway
but to be one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
yes
very true
i agree with you there uh-huh
i think id probably do it
but we could never say what we would do if were not in the circumstance
thats a real easy thing to say that sure i would
but i dont know
i myself wouldnt want to be on the jury like that
thats an awful lot to expect of a person to kill somebody is what it amounts to
yes
but thats what they did
it
true
very true
but they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted
yeah uh-huh
and they wanted something more than they respect the human life
yeah
exactly
anyhow i guess we both agree that it should be in effect
hang them
yeah
i agree it should be in effect
also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect
but i want maybe
i have a problem with this too
i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get $unc$one more chance
thats true
just believe in just about any state in the union a death verdict is an automatic appeal
thats correct
it is
it is
and yes
im inclined to agree with you
i think so
there should be a limit as to the number of appeals
theres some
and maybe i dont remember if this is $unc$texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence
not just for dealing in drugs
convicted drug dealers
it
whats the ru-
there are certain circumstances
and i dont remember what they are
theyre on the distribution end
yes
theyre not selling them
theyre distributing them
its for the large dealers is what its reserved for
uh-huh
and they are in effect killing people
yes
yes
i believe its any capital crime related to drugs
okay
i think thats the way its worded
is that how its worded
i knew it was there
but i
or is it proposed
or is it passed
i do believe thats in
i wouldnt swear to it myself
i believe it is
but i thought it was in effect
i believe youre right though
i think it is
and i have to agree with that
uh-huh
i think it certainly should be $unc$one of the options
ive been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know
i qualify that heavily
because you never know
but to the best of my knowledge we havent had a major problem yet my children are about in the same age bracket
uh-huh
it does
i have $unc$four sons myself
and the youngest is $unc$twenty-eight
so they are all pretty well grown up
and they all went through it going through high school and everything
and knock wood that they have not
i wont say they didnt try it
i wouldnt know
but they
i doubt very much that theyre using it now
in fact im sure they dont
i think lets see the oldest is $unc$thirty-two
and the youngest is probably $unc$twenty-seven $unc$twenty-eight
its the same age bracket
yes
and theres $unc$four $unc$two girls and $unc$two boys
and i think $unc$one of each experimented very slightly with pot
uh-huh
and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
yeah
thats usually the way it is
its just try it out with their peers
and none of them even smoke
they dont
they never
strangely enough their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up
now my ex-wife she quit when she was pregnant with the last $unc$one
and she never started up again
and i just quit about $unc$fourteen months and $unc$two weeks ago
boy
thats tough
yes
it is
i
and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by
my husband hasnt quit yet
and he knows he has to
and he knows he should
and he knows
and he knows
but he hasnt
i do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me
hes very conscious of passive smoking
and hes concerned about it but hasnt quite made it yet
when i was still smoking i felt that way
if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with non smokers i would try to pick my seat where the smoke would blow away from them
or id hold the cigarette under the table
yeah
ive seen all of this
yeah
but now the shoes on the other foot
im aware of other people smoking now
$unc$charles will not smoke in anyone elses house except our own
he will get up
and hell go outside
and hes
so when were invited to peoples house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because theres a lot of people that are very
yes
particularly if they have children
uh-huh
and he tries his best
but the actual quitting he hasnt done
he changed brands to a brand he doesnt like
he put up all of his ash trays
he will not smoke in a comfortable position
but still hes done everything the $unc$smokers $unc$anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking
uh-huh
its a long process
theres a trick i use
they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment
how neat
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take $unc$one $unc$one at a time
and that gets to be a deterrent
he has his in the kitchen
it seems to me that $unc$one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution
yeah
and i can very clearly remember $unc$ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful
and we did end up with $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m p c which i now would not have chosen
really
but that was before the $unc$macintosh
yeah
and $unc$twenty years ago i was in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
i know it
so i would say thats $unc$one of the largest changes at least in my life
yeah
ive seen that just in the last even $unc$five years how much theyve increased in use or probably $unc$eight years
when i was a freshman in college my degree was in computer technology originally
uh-huh
and it seemed like it would
they were just getting out with the disks and all that doing away with the programming cards
uh-huh
right
and
yeah
$unc$thirty years ago i had a college job working as a programmer
and we had to write code in binary
and have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which i dont think exists anymore
i know
no
you never see $unc$one of those punch cards anymore
i think t v has a lot to do with the changes too dont you in peoples attitudes
very possibly
im not sure in the last $unc$ten years its been very different from before
certainly in the last $unc$thirty i would say there have been significant changes even the change from black and white to color television
yeah
$unc$thirty years ago i guess there were color t v
but i sure didnt have access to one
oh
but $unc$twenty years ago practically everybody had a color t v
and now i think theyre almost as many
there are more t v than households
so its close to getting $unc$one t v per person they say
yeah
and now everybody has v c r and $unc$two or $unc$three v c r and that kind of thing
uh-huh
yeah
certainly $unc$ten years ago v c r were just coming on the market
so thats made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance
because now i almost never watch a t v program when its on
yeah
i know
i tape it and then watch it when its convenient
and that way i dont have to worry about being interrupted
i can just put it on pause
yeah
and you can flip through the commercials
so you dont have to watch the commercials
right
thats always convenient
uh-huh
yes
you can watch a program in $unc$forty-five minutes instead of an hour
you skip the commercials
uh-huh
what was our question about decline in socio-
wasnt the decline so much
i think they just said the social changes in the $unc$united $unc$states
yeah
how was life different $unc$ten $unc$twenty or $unc$thirty years ago
so
i cant really remember back that far
but $unc$ten years ago i dont know id say in the $unc$nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with what do you call those little a m radios
yes
and now people have jam box with c d players in them and hand held t v and car phones
yes
thats certainly a difference
yeah
thats another $unc$one
yeah
car phones is a good point and cellular phones of all types and beepers
$unc$ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center
yeah
and i had to carry a beeper around
and they were kind of bulky
and all they did was just make a beep noise
and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call
uh-huh
these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of $unc$two or $unc$three pencils
and they fit in your shirt pocket
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to
and
those are cool
yeah
those are pretty neat
and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something
yeah
and you can still get your messages
yeah
but lets see social changes
where do you think its going to go in $unc$twenty years
i havent the slightest idea
i was just thinking though about a huge social change in the last $unc$ten years is aids
yeah
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed $unc$ten years ago
i know that because i was writing a paper about it
uh-huh
i was writing a journal article
and they still didnt even know what caused it or anything
and there was a suspicion that it was a virus
wow
but nobody had identified it
and they were really just going on epidemiological guesswork because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like hepatitis
uh-huh
and then from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by blood and semen
yeah
and then i
im curious what was your graduate study in
i was in $unc$english as a matter of fact and medieval studies
wow
uh-huh
but i went to work as an editor and writer
so $unc$ten years ago i was working in the medical center publishing a journal and writing about medical topics
yeah
and lets see $unc$twenty years ago i guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill
yeah
and freed people up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy
and i guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded
$unc$thirty years ago there was no pill
uh-huh
you think thats caused a lot of pressure on younger kids today to make choices that they probably shouldnt have to make
yes
i do
i really do
i have $unc$four kids in college right now children and stepchildren
yeah
and i know that the expectation for them was to have sex and much earlier than the expectation when i was in college
uh-huh
yeah
in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends
yeah
yeah
but they certainly didnt expect everybody to
and it was really only acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future
uh-huh
and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays
yeah
its kind of scary when i think of what will happen in $unc$twenty years when i have kids and theyre grown and just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more
so
and i guess the answer is stay flexible because nobody can predict whats going to happen in $unc$twenty years
seems like it cant get much worse
yeah
i certainly wouldnt have been able to $unc$twenty years ago tell you what my kids were likely to be like
course $unc$one of them was just a brand new baby $unc$twenty years ago
so i sure wouldnt have been able to predict for him
uh-huh
and some of the other ones werent born
yeah
sounds like americas going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication
yeah
and
electronic mail
yeah
i just got on that about a year ago
and thats made a difference in the way i do my job because its so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things even when theyre on another continent
yeah
its pretty wild
yeah
even
that reminds me $unc$federal $unc$express was around $unc$ten years ago
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
uh-huh
and nowadays people use $unc$fed $unc$ex all the time
yeah
sure do
people do seem to travel more
its much more common for people even teenagers to be going to $unc$europe and $unc$south $unc$america and asia
yeah
i was almost $unc$thirty before i got off this continent
yeah
and both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
yeah
i know thats what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to $unc$texas from $unc$indiana
and they were like $unc$thirty years ago we wouldnt have done that
uh-huh
and especially come home every couple months
yeah
and
okay
what do you think are some current trends in the way families spend time together based on what youve seen
i think that its getting to where theyre not spending time together
yeah
i think like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husbands been off doing his thing all day today
and ive been off doing my thing all day
and i havent seen him since $unc$eight oclock this morning
really
are you newly married
or
$unc$two years
yeah
same situation here ive been married about $unc$ten months
so yeah
i know what you mean
its really hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and you both have hobbies that are different
yeah
if you have hobbies that are the same then you can enjoy your hobby together
but my husband and i have different hobbies
is he a hunter and a fisher and all that
no
no
hes a record collector and a $unc$hot $unc$wheels collector
thats wild
so he was off today looking at records
uh-huh
and i was off doing household type things laundry
yeah
and did some shopping and stuff
from the people ive talked to i dont know if i should bring this into it
but a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers where they could manage their own schedule
and they could spend more time with their kids
uh-huh
because they look back
and theyre all kind of regretful i think
yeah
i think that would be the ideal situation
i think that would be the ideal situation
i think that a lot of people
like in my case i do shift work
uh-huh
i dont have that choice
yeah
same here
i have to be at work at a certain hour
and its not flexible
yeah
it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours
and maybe after we decide to have kids i might find a job that has flexible hours
i hope so anyway
but i dont know
at $unc$t $unc$i is that where you work
uh-huh
its really kind of sad
some of the people that i work with when i worked on second shift their kids go to school during the day
and then they wouldnt see them at night because they would be at work and the kids are all ready in bed
uh-huh
and so it was kind of like they see their kids for $unc$fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses
this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something
yeah
so it was really sad that a lot of families have to have dual income
a lot of people choose to which is fine
yeah
but then the kids kind of suffer
yeah
it would be nice to be able to just have back in the old days back when i grew up
uh-huh
yeah
the mom stayed home and raised the kids
my mom didnt go back to work until i was in junior high school
yeah
so she was there pretty much all my formative years
yeah
and that was nice
and i liked that
and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids
but i think with the way the future is economy wise
i dont think its going to be realistic
i know
unfortunately thats probably true
do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids
do you think its more watching t v and stuff like that not really
i think very few spend quality time
i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that
yeah
i think that most kids that i see they dont really value quality time
yeah
its always that way until its too late
until theyre older
and then they look back
yeah
its true
what are some other questions they have
im not sure
i know my parents are growing up
i guess they never spent much time watching t v
in fact ive never seen my mom turn on the t v
we didnt really have one
really
yeah
and they spent a lot of time outside with us and stuff
but my dad had his own business
and it was easier for them to do that
but i dont know
i guess i didnt realize what a luxury it was at the time
i think kids now a days are raised on t v
t v a surrogate parent
yeah
yeah
thats a good way to put it
and not a very good one at that
yeah
thats a pretty good way to put it
if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do
i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong
i hope to be able to spend their growing up years being in the home not having to work and being able to do
yeah
i know a lot of people who
i work part-time also
and i
a lot of people that i work for are mothers that stay home
uh-huh
and they do a lot of volunteer work
and theyre real active in the community
and they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldnt ordinarily be able to do if they were working
uh-huh
and id like to be able to do that
id like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids
do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff
yeah
yeah
i agree
i hope that happens in my case
yeah
but i think thats for the few and far between
i think that probably $unc$ninety percent of the parents out there are probably working parents
yeah
yeah
and i dont really see that trend changing much
if anything i think theres going to be fewer and fewer single income families
i know
yeah
and whats sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids that may not necessarily be consistent with yours
yeah
exactly
i dont even know what day care is really all about because i never went to a day care center
yeah
i never had that kind of experience
i dont even think we had
i dont even remember them being around when we were little
yeah
it seems like thats a big trend in the last $unc$ten years
day cares have popped up and become a lot bigger part of the kids lives
yeah
its like a home away from home for a lot of them
sure is
i guess we could ring this off since weve exhausted all of our ideas
we seem to agree
yeah
i think this is a good closing point
yeah
so
it was really nice talking to you
yeah
you too
i wish you the best
thanks
you too
okay
thanks
bye
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
do you vote regular
yeah
every one
but thats just in the past say about $unc$six years
before that i really didnt pay any attention at all
thats me
ive never paid any attention to voting
you havent
huh-uh
yeah
i didnt use to
but now i really
because i get so angry about what goes on
and then i feel like i cant really complain too much unless
unless you have something to do with it
yeah
right
but the problem is that i am very liberal politically
and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for
liberal
what do you mean by liberal
liberal politically
im pretty left wing $unc$democrat
so
i dont know anything about politics
you dont
whats the main difference between $unc$republicans and $unc$democrats
okay
theres a lot of them
it depends on what issue youre talking about
but $unc$democrats on a lot of issues are more liberal than $unc$republicans
and its kind of hard to say now especially after $unc$desert $unc$storm
but i think back in the times when my political opinions were being formed during the $unc$vietnam war and stuff the $unc$republicans were more what they called $unc$hawks which is more aggressive in war and more pro war and pro aggression
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the $unc$democrats were the $unc$doves
they were more for peace
and im not sure how much that holds true anymore
i think the issues are
okay
and you vote for the $unc$democrats
or
yeah
usually
yeah
and $unc$democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs
uh-huh
and programs to
the big $unc$republican thing is that they vote for less government
they want less government involvement in society
uh-huh
and so theyre less apt to vote in more aid to people
or theyre less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things
okay
have you ever voted at all
no
i never have
you havent
huh-uh
how old are you
im $unc$twenty-six
gosh
i know i
i dont know that much about it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i dont keep up on it
and i dont feel like i have enough knowledge on it to pick the right person
yeah
yeah uh-huh
so thats what they need they said something to improve voting
uh-huh
if they could make it easier to find out whats going on
do you know what i mean
yeah
yeah
to me i didnt know what would have been wrong with
i cant even remember who ran for president against $unc$bush
i think it was that woman
$unc$du-
wasnt it a woman
no
it was $unc$dukakis from $unc$massachusetts
$unc$dukakis
okay
didnt he have a woman
or was that $unc$reagan
there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while
yeah
that was
$unc$ferraro
yeah
$unc$ferraro
that was a while ago
that was a couple elections ago
yeah
okay
yeah
thats okay
thats what i mean
i didnt know what the difference between $unc$dukakis and $unc$bush was
uh-huh
i didnt know anything about $unc$bush or $unc$dukakis
what do you think about what you see on t v about them like in the news or on the ads
do you kind of just
okay
i dont remember anything about $unc$dukakis
you dont
but theyre all saying that theyre going to do whatever is best for their campaign anyway
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats what i mean
if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and
uh-huh
i dont know
know in school they didnt teach you about the government not really
right
you didnt get any government classes
huh-uh
yeah
its really hard too
because before they used to have a lot of
it seems like the stuff that they put out now it doesnt just seem like it
i know for a fact that any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material
what do you believe in
what do you believe in
they dont take any stands on anything
they kind of say what do you want me to believe
yeah
or they word it so that its really hard to tell where theyre standing on certain issues
im not sure theyre
yeah
i know how they do it
uh-huh
it
like with the abortion issues and stuff
uh-huh
yeah
they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and things like that
so thats kind of how i judge
theres a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control
or let me see
i try to look at if some of the newspaper articles or the
i dont trust t v as much
but newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past
but you get
right
it all depends again on whos writing it and who theyre for because they can slant that too
right
and like i said most of the politicians im
also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and everybodys got stuff they dont want known
right
everybodys got a secret
so
anyway im sorry
i didnt have much knowledge
thats okay
do you think
i dont even remember this being on there
what would it take
god this is really good actually to talk to somebody who hasnt voted
what kind of
incentive
what kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it
like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library
or
i guess that would be good
im sure theyve got it at the library
uh-huh
uh-huh
if i get to the library
ive got $unc$two babies so i dont
yeah
do you
yeah
that will tie you down a little bit
but i dont know
or do you feel like its not really going to make that much difference if you dont vote
or
i know if enough people think like that it would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that
yeah
yeah
a lot of people theyll vote the way their family votes then your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote $unc$democrat
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
not in my family
no
were really independent
all split
but a lot of families do that
i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote
right
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved
golly
i lie
but
i dont know
if i did understand politics i probably would vote more
uh-huh
but like i said if i voted for $unc$bush
or like when $unc$gary $unc$hart was running a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking
$unc$hart
uh-huh
not that i think he was good looking
but he was young
yeah
yeah
and then i didnt think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
uh-huh
because it
what
he had an affair
yeah
yeah
and it just threw him out of the whole running
yeah
and a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote
and
uh-huh
yeah
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life youre going to let it come into work
but im sure theres a lot of people that have had
uh-huh
i think everybody does
it just depends on how well you can hide it
yeah
and i
thats very true
i think that doesnt really have that much to do with unless theyve done something really horrible or something real abnormal
criminal or something like thats different
yeah
right
but if him and his wife werent getting along
but otherwise
uh-huh
what effect does that have on him running for president
do you know what i mean
yeah
yeah
its all so secretive
we really dont see the true person anyway
thats right
i think thats having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run that the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that really dont have anything to do with how well they do the job
right
but see theyre trying to find an excuse not to deal with the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no
and if they dont say yes or no then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldnt have if they had come down on the wrong side
do you know what im saying
right
so they just try and make it a personal thing
if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had pictures of $unc$bush walking around with his grandchildren
and even from $unc$reagan it looks like a mcdonalds commercial
uh-huh
thats about what it looked like
what did you think of $unc$reagan as a president
i just thought he was really inept
i dont think he did anything at all
they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet
and the people that were
do you think he won from $unc$carter because of the hostages that were held at that time
i think that was part of it
i think theres a lot of the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff
uh-huh
people just had a picture of $unc$carter as not being real capable
but he actually
all right
this
i thought he was great
i thought $unc$carter was good too
and that was
yeah
did you
i always liked him
i thought he was great at the time
and i just couldnt get over the fact that $unc$reagan beat him
that i just couldnt believe that he got voted out
but i think i wasnt
lets see
thats been about $unc$ten years ago right
uh-huh
yeah
okay
i was only $unc$fifteen or $unc$sixteen
but i remember $unc$carter
and i liked him
you did
have you heard stuff about him lately
do you know what hes doing
no
i sure dont
he is really active still politically
hes been overseas
you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the $unc$middle $unc$east for pe-
what are your
do you use credit cards
not very often
i usually
the ones we use is $unc$visa
and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
huh-uh
i have
so it doesnt get the credit
right
the interest rate is so high that youre really
if youre going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think dont you
yeah
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that its not a very good idea
thats right
do you have a lot of credit cards
i have a lot of them
but i dont use them very much though
right
i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes tuition if im short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
the other thing i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off more than $unc$one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
yeah
just goes on and on
which is what they want
yeah
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think i can just charge it
but really if they dont have the money then they arent going to have it in a month
so
yeah
thats true
they make the mistake of pushing all their cards
there are times when its very useful like emergency trip or something
yeah
yeah
sometimes when you
the money will be available
but its not immediately handy
i think theyre very helpful plus the fact that its helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
right
but you really do need to be very responsible about it
or you end up in deep trouble
yeah
i made that mistake when i first got a job
and thats kind of like
it took me quite a while to pay them off
uh-huh
so after that i decided im not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything
and that worked for a while
and then we got married
so we decided if we used them we would pay them off as we go
right
right
that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
the other thing about them is too you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and havent developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things
if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car
right
thats true
yeah
so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system over the last few years
uh-huh
but its true
you have to be very careful or you end up going in the deep end
and an awful lot of people are in trouble
uh-huh
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card company that
and he makes calls to people who have problems credit problems that are trying to work out
huh-uh
and poor thing he comes home very depressed every night because the world has so many problems of that sort
oh
its a really big problem i think and takes mature people to treat it
yeah
so that its a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
right
i think the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards with a big write off at the end of the year
yeah
but now its punch money because
right
it didnt do you any good now does it
you cannot
right
you cannot write off your interest
even before it probably wasnt though because you didnt get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
yeah
im not
other than that i dont have too much on credit cards
but
its good to talk to you
yeah
you too
thanks for calling
uh-huh
bye now
bye
okay
do you exercise regularly
yeah
i sure do
what do you do
i ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights
okay
i love to ride a bicycle
i live right near $unc$white $unc$rock $unc$lake
so i try to ride about $unc$ten to $unc$twenty miles a day
but i havent been doing so well this year
thats good
but
last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while
and when id gotten back i had gotten some sun that day
the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel
it was the sweating not the burn
thats weird
that was wild
but i dont exercise now
i just had a baby $unc$three months ago
i havent really gotten back into exercising
yeah
but i exercised real good for a couple of years
it was aerobics and lifting weights $unc$three nights a week
and it was running $unc$three nights a week
whats your motivation
whats my motivation
yeah
a friend of mine always pushing me
this was in $unc$louisiana
and she would push
she was hey
lets go do it
and she wouldnt take no for an answer
was it for health or to look good
i just wanted to look good
yeah
i was think
it wasnt really health related
it was just a side benefit
yeah
yeah
because im not big or anything
but im not in great shape
but when i worked out i got in pretty good shape
i didnt build up muscle though
i just got real good and toned
yeah
i dont think women look good with muscles
up to a point
up to a point
no
yeah
yeah
its just some of those women that come up there looking like $unc$arnold schwarzeneggers sister just doesnt get it
yeah
what was the other question
lets see do you do it as a task
or do you enjoy working out
i guess its a task cause i cant make myself do it lately
yeah
i think i enjoy it sometimes
and theres other times when i just get tired of it
and i feel like im obligated to do it because ive been doing it
yeah
so i should keep up
you dont want to lose yourself
and theres some days its the hardest thing in the world to get started
how old are you
im $unc$twenty-seven
okay
so youre still young
yeah
still young getting older
we all are
yeah
but
its not hard to stay
if you keep working out when youre young though when you get older your bodys not going to look as bad
i seen an old woman today
she was about $unc$eighty
and she looked so good
yeah
she was standing just as straight and tall
and she had a small waist
and she didnt have
you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle
right
she didnt have that at all
her lips were a little bit wide
but a lot of
back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway
right
so she may be keeping that on purpose
so
yeah
i notice if you stay in shape you dont age as bad
uh-huh
i think too
i go to school too at night
and last semester i had stopped working out cause i hurt myself and started smoking a lot
and you just
those kind of things age you more
smoking ages you quick
right
an
it puts those little wrinkles around your lips
right
an you cant
and then it just kind of feeds itself
you smoke
and then you dont work out because you
you get winded
right
and so
i smoke a pack a day
an
i finally quit because all i was doing was going down hill fast
i cant quit smoking
ive tried
i was telling a friend of mine that id be almost as bad as being an alcoholic
yeah
i cant quit smoking
ive tried
i just cant do it
i quit when i was pregnant with my kids
but as soon as i had them right back to it
right back to them
yeah
yeah
it was like
that was the only reason i quit
i didnt want to
thats
and i dont want to quit smoking
i enjoy that
i said i have very few vices
ill keep this one thank you
yeah
yeah
but did you ever go to $unc$one of those health clubs or anything
i went to health club a few years ago
and now i work out at home because my schedule with school and work i dont have time to get down to one
uh-huh
there used to be one that was a $unc$twenty-four hour that i used to go to
but i actually prefer to work out alone
i like to work out with people
really
i need
you
i need competition is what i need
yeah
ive got to have somebody to compete with
or i dont want to do anything
i wouldnt mind working out with a friend and stuff
but when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait
uh-huh
are you
i like to start get it done and get out of there
uh-huh
are you married or anything
no
im not
no
get your girlfriend to work out with you
a lot of women like that
id love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him
he doesnt work out very often
course he dont need to
hes small
and he works as a laborer on the railroad
yeah
so hes building his muscles up all day
he doesnt have to do anything
right
he can eat like a horse too
and he dont gain it like i do
but
especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to just have to start all over
yeah
you have to
you can gain too much weight
i gained a little bit too much
but i looked
with my first little boy i did gain a lot of weight
i got about $unc$fifty pounds overweight with him
and i didnt loose it until $unc$two years ago
and then i got pregnant and ruined that
so
yeah
like i say it aint as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant
right
i wasnt overweight when i got pregnant with him
i just wasnt in shape
i dont know the difference
but
yeah
some people are a little bit fanatical about it
i
about weight
yeah
and about working out and fitness
exercise
i like to work out to look good and stay in shape
and i know its good for me
but people that live for it and eat a bunch of different pills and all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit obsessive
thats what my friend did
she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else
and really we was
even with her taking all those expensive vitamins and stuff we stayed right on the same track with each other
yeah
yeah
developing and everything
now there
you can take those
what is it
steroids
steroids
yeah
i couldnt think
yeah
theres really bad for you
i was trying to say hemorrhoids
no
i was trying to say hormones
hormones
yeah
hormones
but
yeah
steroids
but i stay from that crap
yeah
its too dangerous
i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something
yeah
i had a friend whose brother did steroids
and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out
it all turned to fat
and he just really looked bad
really
ugh
but
i didnt know it did that
i dont know if it does to everybody
he was
just thats how it affected him
and he i dont know just
yeah
but ive been wanting to get me a bike
ive been wanting to get a $unc$ten speed to ride around
im scared to run for dogs
course i know dogs can get you on a bike too
but seems like it
yeah
at least you got a chance to out run them that way
yeah
i dont like to run myself
ive thought about it several times
and i like to move a little faster and cover more ground
they
yeah
theyve come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was
i would think it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff
yeah
its real hard on your legs
and its hard on women
and it just makes stuff move down
yeah
but i like jogging
i dont mind that
i can get out and do that as long as its not hot
i cant
if its hot you cant do that
but i love to run in the rain
just be careful not to slide
yeah
but you cant ride your bike at all in the rain can you
no
you cant
its dangerous
you slide
at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could
but a regular $unc$ten speed with those skinny tires you slide all over the place
uh-huh
yeah
when i did ride my friends bike that $unc$one time i dont know what i was trying to do
i was trying to make a u turn
and i never could make a u turn in a bike
i can do it in my car
but i tried to do it on that $unc$ten speed and wrecked
and i told her a dog was chasing me
but i wrecked it into the curb
i didnt hurt it too bad
i scratched it on the
she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire i think
yeah
but
its been nice talking to you
yeah
and
good luck with the new kid
thank you
shes good
have fun exercising
all right
all right
bye-bye
all right
do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there
weve got quite a few
what were more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city
the
weve actually had some warnings in $unc$raleigh on air pollution
you mean for smog and stuff
uh-huh
because of there so many cars
and we have a belt line around $unc$raleigh where were trying to divert traffic
and its just surrounding the city
and you can actually see it
theres a couple of tall buildings in $unc$raleigh
uh-huh
and you can actually
theyre blurred
theyre even dark
and what it is is the pollution
what do you think of the greenhouse effect thats going on
i guess thats the fluorocarbons
yeah
and
thats causing the hole in the ozone
uh-huh
yeah
thats very serious
were even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream
uh-huh
it is scary though isnt it
yeah
the last $unc$two years our winters have been absolutely nothing
right
maybe $unc$one snow
all right
$unc$north $unc$carolina
thats up there by $unc$kentucky isnt it
$unc$kentucky
uh-huh
$unc$north $unc$carolina is all the way on the east coast
okay
its further west than $unc$georgia
its right below $unc$virginia
okay
kentuckys next to $unc$virginia im pretty sure
im from $unc$kentucky
i should know
but i dont
im sorry
but $unc$kentucky we use to have just real cold cold winters
uh-huh
and wed have $unc$three and $unc$four feet of snow
course here in $unc$texas they dont have snow
they dont know what snow is
they freak out when theres snow on the ground
uh-huh
originally im from $unc$texas
so $unc$amarillo
so
$unc$amarillo
uh-huh
thats close to here
yeah
real close
how long have you been in $unc$raleigh
ive been out of $unc$texas about $unc$ten years
how old are you
$unc$twenty $unc$seven
i almost forgot my age
okay
were the same age
really
yeah
i forget my age all the time
so thats okay
i think its just something that goes with the territory
but to me $unc$texas and $unc$kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
okay
uh-huh
in $unc$texas im serious if it gets cold and it looks like its going to rain i swear they close everything down
i just laugh
i do
they get
and traffic slows down to nothing
theyve been doing the same thing here
its kind of funny
i guess northerners are different
but even $unc$north $unc$carolinians they dont know how to handle cold weather
no northe-
im from the north
thats why i said in $unc$kentucky we
i dont know
you just get used to the weather
and of course the people down in south theyre not used to cold weather and stuff
and it just
uh-huh
i dont know
i just laugh
every time they have snow on the ground everythings closed up
and you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
thats true
but
do you all have much pollution there
no
not really
not to see it
of course $unc$t $unc$i is here $unc$oscar $unc$mayer
uh-huh
and there is a few factories
but i dont see much pollution going on
what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road
uh-huh
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe
see they have what is it a test or something like that they call it
uh-huh
and thats supposed to cut down on it
supposedly thats supposed to catch it
but ill tell you what
and even these buses lord it real bad these buses in $unc$raleigh
yeah
school buses and the commercial buses
yeah
yeah
school buses are notorious
theyre burning that diesel fuel is what it is
yeah
yeah
and it gets bad
you know what theyve started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses theyve started putting them up at the top
uh-huh
and that way it gets above other cars on the road
thats a good idea
and it really does make a difference although it settles
even if its at the top and its a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles
and if youre going to be jogging on the side of the road thats even more miserable
id have to go out to the country to jog
the pregnant women arent supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes
no
i didnt know that
when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it
because i was walking back and forth toc-
not back and forth
i was walking home from the college i was going to in $unc$kentucky
uh-huh
and i was having to walk along the highway
it was just $unc$one day a week
but it was in
i have no sense of smell
so i couldnt smell this
but it would make me sick
and id be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
uh-huh
golly thats bad
but
yeah
its
yeah
all the exhaust
that was $unc$four years ago too
its probably a lot worse now
im sure
yeah
you can really feel it in your breathing even normal people
and if youre older you can really deplete your oxygen
and itll pass out
uh-huh
and its killed several people
do you smoke
i just smoke $unc$one in the evening if that
so im a very very light smoker
yeah
its kind of l-
it was kind of funny
they were doing some ozone testing the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a
and they were just screening some candidates
and i dont think id ever do that
but they asked me if i was a smoker
and i didnt fit into the smokers category
and i didnt fit into the nonsmokers category
i was just $unc$one of those
yeah
because you do smoke $unc$one a day
yeah
in between people
so that kind of threw them off
but theyre doing a lot of research here the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a
for the air pollution
for ozone and yeah all that
theyre real big into it
theyve got $unc$research $unc$triangle $unc$park here
and theyre just doing a lot of stuff
but they
i dont hear much about it down here
course $unc$texas we dont have a bunch of pollution
huh-uh
but too weve got that air coming in off the coast
uh-huh
and itd blow it up north
uh-huh
so maybe thats part of the reason its not so bad down here
uh-huh
but no
it would seem like it would be the same way on the $unc$california coastline wouldnt it
gosh i think i would hate to live in $unc$california the smog there
uh-huh
i cant believe they have warnings here which its mainly just when it gets real real hot
uh-huh
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
really
thats kind of good to know
because lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
i think they do that for most everybody
especially its usually for the young children and older old people
uh-huh
you ought to come to $unc$north $unc$carolina
its a big change
it is
yeah
there was no trees where i was from in $unc$amarillo
and here theyve got the mountains the beach the trees
theyve got streams rivers ponds
oh
its really pretty here
this is pretty wooded area down here
so
is it
in a lot of parts
yeah
i know $unc$texas is supposed to be flat
but down by the $unc$denison $unc$dam theres a lot of
uh-huh
$unc$sherman and $unc$denison
do you know my grandparents live in $unc$durant
they do
yeah
they live close then
yeah
real close
i go there
in $unc$durant $unc$oklahoma
yeah
you go where
you go to visit them
uh-huh
oh
yeah
we used to go fishing in $unc$lake $unc$texoma
yeah
down by $unc$lake $unc$texoma theres a bunch of wooded area
this
but kentuckys beautiful
theyve got trees
and trees are supposed to purify
you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff
huh-uh
its a philodendron
really
its supposed to filter the air for you in your home
im going to have to get some
i had $unc$one
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born $unc$four months ago
uh-huh
do you smoke
yeah
i do
do you
yeah
i do
did you smoke when you were pregnant
yeah
i did
i couldnt make myself quit
i did cut down a lot
i can understand that
ive got $unc$one vice
and smoking is it
i dont drink
and i try not to cuss
and i do very little
and smoking i got in the habit of it when i was about $unc$thirteen
yeah
$unc$one thing i miss is the people from $unc$texas are
i miss their morals their values and everything
its
yeah
were down here at the $unc$bible belt arent we
i wasnt saved until i got down here
and people down here are just
theres so many $unc$christians
and its so different from $unc$kentucky
but
uh-huh
howd you get involved in this research
i worked at $unc$t $unc$i for a while
but then my brother-in-law works there
and he got me into it
i see
howd you get into it
i was taking a voice i o class and actually doing some research
and so they told me about this project
its fun
i like talking to new people
uh-huh
and a couple of times ive been interrupted by my little girl
ive had to hang up and stuff
uh-huh
but i enjoy it
i talked to people from what $unc$carolina now up in $unc$boston and $unc$new $unc$york
uh-huh
$unc$boston is $unc$new $unc$york isnt it
no
no
bostons above
$unc$boston $unc$massachusetts
uh-huh
but ive talked to people in $unc$new $unc$york
but ive talked to a lot of people in $unc$texas
i guess its because $unc$t $unc$i down here
yeah
ive talked to a lot of people in $unc$texas
i had $unc$one call actually from $unc$charlotte $unc$north $unc$carolina and $unc$virginia and
i cant remember where all
from up north like you said
i think $unc$one was from $unc$boston
with $unc$boston i love their accent
i do
i love the $unc$boston accent
i met a girl from $unc$boston $unc$one time
my husband was in the service
so we went from $unc$kentucky to $unc$louisiana down here to $unc$texas
uh-huh
and his familys down here
uh-huh
were out of the service now
i bet youre glad
yeah
he got out of his unit right after $unc$panama
he went to $unc$panama when $unc$noriega was doing all that
uh-huh
gosh
and he
it seems to me that
i do not know whether the jury system
i should not say i do not know
i do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed
it seems to have worked time immemorial
and when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
uh-huh
i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required
and indeed some juries are no longer $unc$twelve people
they are down to as small as $unc$six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials
uh-huh
i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because there is always a jury that might be swayed by the moment either to be too lenient or too vengeful i guess
yeah
on the other hand justices are more apt to understand the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions $unc$one way or the other
yeah
but is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world
if they keep giving everybody $unc$hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even for that matter repair the lack of judges and other
yeah
i think that is what is happening
i think the judges are trying to save the people from having the cost of new prisons
yeah
they
yeah
that might be it
they certainly
they are saying the people cannot afford it
i dont know how it is in $unc$virginia
but in $unc$florida now someone was just sentenced to $unc$eighteen years i heard it on $unc$today without any specific recommendation for waving the normal procedures
and the $unc$eighteen years will translate into something like $unc$four point $unc$seven if the prisoner is a model prisoner
yeah
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail
plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
right
so yeah
you might be right about that
i do not know
it just seems to me that only about $unc$ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway
right
and only about $unc$four or $unc$five percent of
in the very end
less than half the cases that go to trial end up with the jury actually making the verdict
with a conviction
okay
that most of it is plea bargained half way through
or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
right
but how do you feel about the jury system itself
do you think that should be changed
or do you know in $unc$virginia if they have smaller juries
or
i do not know exactly what the size of the juries
i know $unc$one of my friends was brought up for jury duty
yeah
for
and he only heard very piddly type cases
most of it was robberies or things like that
it was not any serious crimes
so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person any felony anyways
yeah
i guess we
they give the person the option for a jury
yeah
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury
but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in any sort of a case where damages are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury
uh-huh
uh-huh
takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there in some states
uh-huh
i do not know
i should imagine $unc$virginia from what i read is like every other state
it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system
because i guess everywhere i read that there is a shortage of judges
right
right
not that they wont appoint them
but there is no budget for them i guess
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the court clerks
yeah
whatever
so it seems
no
i do not think i would change it
the more i verbalize it i do not think i would want to change the system
right
i do not know what we would replace it with
i do not think i would either
yeah
i know
it does seem like the purpose of getting people in jail so that the
i cannot think of the word i am looking for
the deterrent for people to not commit the crime is sort of gone away
yes
people have
i do not know
they just do not care any more
the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is
and yet there are so many people in prison
people that
the prison population as far as i
my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last $unc$ten years and tripled in the last $unc$twenty
i mean it
i guess our population has grown some too
but there definitely is to me $unc$one of the worst things that could ever happen from what i read and see and understand
i do no think i could handle prison
yeah
it would be very difficult
i would be interested in finding out what the percentage of drug related type things are
there must be a very great degree of that
and
yeah
but there again i do not know if the jury system itself comes in to play there
i would think that
$unc$one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability
of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is the interviewing of jurors after the trial
it seems to me that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision
i do not
yeah
i imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
but i would think if i did anything i would protect the juror from any sort of an inquisition after
i know
on the other hand though after the $unc$barry trial up here the big local trial as well as national
yeah
yeah
yeah
i do a lot of business up in $unc$washington
i was there during the trial actually
yeah
yeah
and the opposite was true of me
after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did
yeah
yeah
yeah
it was like a picture is not good enough
we want to see
i do not know what they wanted honestly
did they want the guy to i do not know
just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was
i
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted
i felt that way
i felt
but it does not matter
the guy was obviously guilty
no
but
yeah
i always balanced in the situation
i remember the jurors
i thought to myself how did
i think they only found him guilty on $unc$one count which was a class something felony which was not even punishable to the degree that they thought it
$unc$one count
yeah
but i do not know
maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody
and the prosecutors do a lousy job
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it
i am not making excuses for
yeah
that might be it
yeah
i think we are getting
i think i am getting a call coming in
okay
all right nice talking with you
it has been nice talking to you
thank you
uh-huh
bye-bye
okay
what you mean my voice
yes
no
i am from $unc$kentucky originally
so
the topic today was gardening and lawn care
uh-huh
ooh
i know
we are about to hit it in few minutes
i figured i could make this call and get it over with
we are going to mow and trim and edge
yeah
and that is all we have been doing all weekend
you know what
it seems like we are doing it here forever
we bought a large house that was completely unlandscaped
it probably was up to your shoulder in thistles
that was all that was there
uh-huh
and we hired a professional landscaper to do it
and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted
or the plants do not make the winter time
and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year probably through the fall too and rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
uh-huh
how many kids do you have
just $unc$two
okay
but they are just $unc$eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more
how old are they
$unc$four and $unc$five
$unc$four and $unc$five
goodness
uh-huh
i have got a $unc$four year old and a $unc$four month old and an $unc$eight year old stepdaughter
i have a $unc$twenty $unc$six year old stepson
and i do not know if that counts
you do not have to tend to him
i did for many years
so
you did
okay
it is over with
yeah
he is gone
yeah
it is over with
back to gardening
are you $unc$one of these $unc$howard $unc$garrett organic enthusiasts or a $unc$neil $unc$sperry nuke the lawn with chemicals
if i can just nuke it i would do it
but i do not
i just
it is like i will get out there and pull my weeds
i do not have a real big front yard
but i do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch
uh-huh
uh-huh
because the porch is pretty big
i live in town
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts
i do not like it
and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff
and i just plowed through the whole $unc$nine yards
got up everything
there was some plants that are just spring bloomers
uh-huh
and i
when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
uh-huh
so i just broke all them off
it was a hyacinth
have you ever seen those
yeah
they are pretty in the spring
but the leaves i do not like them
once
all right
are you sure they are hyacinths
because that is a bulb
yeah
it is a bulb
you should of just ripped the whole thing out
no
because i like the plant in the spring
i love those pink flowers
they are just pretty
so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because i want them to come back up next year
have you had
is this the first year they have been up
yeah
let me tell you they do not come back very well at all
maybe they will up further north
but down
and you are not that much further north
i have probably planted around here maybe $unc$six $unc$hundred bulbs
of hyacinths
no
i have done hyacinths
of everything
but i have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because they do not take the heat here
and if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny
they will
yep
about the only bulb that repeats well in my area is the daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
okay
i have got some daffodils
and everybody down here calls these flags the irises i guess
they call them flags
that is what they call them down here
they get just $unc$one bloom on the plant
i am not sure what they are called
when does it bloom
but i do not much
i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring
it has got gr-
and what color
they come in all different colors
the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors
and you only get $unc$one of them
per bulb
you get $unc$one big flower that looks like a lily
i do not know what they are called
i have always called them
i do not know what i have called them
but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
what i bet you they are
and i am a pretty good gardener
because i have killed a lot of things here
and i have planted a lot of them
and i work on a landscape committee for our neighborhood
uh-huh
and our neighborhood is a planned development with i think it is $unc$seven $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty-five families
uh-huh
but we have about $unc$sixty acres that we have to plant
i am going to bet you that is a lily because it is
yeah
it is some type of lily
and i will get
is it
what color is yours blooming
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it will fade into a solid purple
and what does the foliage look like
does it fit that
green spiky leaves
it looks almost like a hyacinth only a lot higher
and it is a bulb
i bet you what those things are is a dutch iris
dutch irises
i bet you it is a dutch iris
uh-huh
on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies
i really do not know
i am going to bet you that
that has got to be blooming this time of year
it has
no
they are dead now
i was just going to correct myself
they bloom in the spring
because they would have bloomed pretty early
yeah
they bloomed in the spring
yeah
right about after the daffodils
right about the same time or after
okay
i will bet you those are dutch iris
i took and just mowed over them last year
uh-huh
and we have been
i do not much care for them
after the bloom dies they are not pretty
and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves
but i took them out of my front yard
and i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something and forgot about them through the whole winter
yep
i went out there this $unc$spring
and they had took root right where they were on top of each other
and they told me that they are the hardest things to kill
but they are real easy to grow
does that help
then it is not a dutch iris then
gosh
i am not sure what it is
they said that they are irises
it is some type of iris though
but they call them flags down here yeah
i am not so sure that $unc$texans know what they have got
i do not know what it is
i am just getting into gardening this year
did you just move down here
we moved here a year ago
yeah
last spring
we moved in this house $unc$may of last year
so it was really too late to do much
who
because i have probably got i do not know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway
the whole perimeter bordering the house is all in $unc$texas wildflower beds
and i am into that
oh
and it looks quite formal
it really does
it looks quite formal
that is
but it has been about $unc$three or $unc$four years of playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here
what kind of blue
i want blue and purple and just different shades of that because my house is gray
you want blue
and blue looks so pretty against it
uh-huh
blue is hard
do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer
i bought
i would like to have one that would bloom next year too
that will come back up
okay
put in a perennial blue salvia
now the plant itself will grow about $unc$eighteen inches tall
uh-huh
and it will send out a flower spike
you will see them blooming now
it is a wildflower here
but you can get them in the nursery
i am looking for a pen
i want to write this down because
that is where i went this year
because i waited too late to really plant stuff
but i did not know that these hyacinths
like i said i do not know anything about plants
i did not know the hyacinths were going to die
yep
the nursery men will sell you things here
and they are kind of in a labor of love
the other thing to do if you really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for $unc$five weeks or so to cool them
yeah
that is what i did with my plants
i had bought these $unc$celosias or whatever
yep
and they will not grow down here
huh-uh
okay
perennial
uh-huh
blue
salvia
salvia
uh-huh
and that will bloom all $unc$summer long
but it insists on full sun
okay
i guess i just went and bought me just about $unc$nineteen dollars worth of little buds already grown
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it looks pretty good out there
i will tell you another plant that is purply
uh-huh
it is kind of a purply blue red
uh-huh
it is really a pretty plant
it is sold down here as $unc$purple $unc$buddy
$unc$purple $unc$buddy
its not
yeah
it is not a perennial
it is an annual
but it will take the heat down here
$unc$purple $unc$buddy
$unc$purple $unc$buddy
its proper name is $unc$gomphrena
how do you spell that
$unc$g $unc$o $unc$m $unc$p $unc$h $unc$r $unc$e $unc$n $unc$a
$unc$gomphrena
and is sold as $unc$purple $unc$buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower
okay
and they make about a foot high plant
and they send out this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it
but that purple ball
$unc$wayne i feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isnt available
how do you feel about it
yeah
i feel much the same way
ive $unc$two kids right now
yeah
$unc$one is $unc$two and a half
and ones $unc$nine months
and that age of course everything you do theyre trying to learn to do
and so its important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn that they need to learn at the age reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing
yeah
yeah
we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren
and ive always tried to do things with them like when youre at the little league helping out even though im not a good athlete myself
i was able to help the coach in just controlling the kids if nothing else
and weve always tried to take our children and now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to
i think thats just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and so its
we have lived several places around the $unc$u $unc$s
and where weve lived weve taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area
when we lived in $unc$tennessee we took them to $unc$washington $unc$d $unc$c to see all the capitol and things like that when they were small
and its helps i think the children when theyre learning in school to say ive been there and ive seen that
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
thats the type
yeah
it certainly does because the things in the books seem so dead to the kids unless theyve actually been there or whatever
because i remember our family we went everywhere
and seeing $unc$new $unc$england and being on $unc$plymouth $unc$rock and stuff like that really made the whole thing more visual
yeah
yes
and we could read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon
yeah
yeah
weve gone through that
i remember my parents didnt do all those type things
and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that
and even now with my grandchildren i feel its a very important thing to be done
right
because if kids dont look up to you or cant feel they can spend time with you theyre going to find someone else
yeah
and nowadays theres a lot of people out there that you dont want your kid emulating or whatever
yeah
i can remember $unc$one of the things im most proud of is when my son was
i think it was in the sixth grade
they had to write a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do
and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him
a real point of pride with me
yeah
that is nice
yeah
it sounds like we both have colds
yeah
its $unc$ten oclock here in $unc$falls $unc$church $unc$virginia
oh
so that the only reason im home is because im home with a cold
were
and the wife says you need something to do
talk to a guy on the phone
yeah
im sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of $unc$dallas $unc$texas
were kind of far apart here
yeah
this is a very interesting program i heard about here on this
and when i signed up for it it looked like it could make a real contribution in participating
right
yeah
im an electrical engineer by trade here in $unc$virginia
yeah
likewise we do some projects every now and then
we like to get support from other companies as well
yeah
im an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan
trying to work myself out of a job
but its been an interesting roughly $unc$nine months here
and this is our home area
oh
weve lived here about $unc$seventeen years
and its
we enjoy living here
its where we originally started out
and weve lived up north for a while in $unc$chicago and over in $unc$tennessee
so wound up back about $unc$two $unc$hundred miles away from where we started out
yep
thats about all i can think to talk about right now
its been a pleasure talking with you
okay
thank you
right
bye
bye-bye
all right
you live in $unc$dallas
yes
i live in $unc$dallas
i understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
yeah
i think right now its kind of bad
i dont live in a house
i live in an apartment
are you in a house
yeah
uh-huh
okay
yeah
we have a single family home in northern $unc$virginia just outside of $unc$washington
uh-huh
i guess the best i can do is compare apartments
if it can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of
this one gave us free cable and ceiling fans
and it was practically new when i moved in here
and the carpet was new
and
do you live in the high-rise
no
its not a high-rise
its just a $unc$two story building
uh-huh
but there are a lot of buildings
but its just $unc$two stories
on the second floor they dont have a patio
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio
on the first floor where i am theres a patio
okay
so you have $unc$one floor all to yourself
yeah
okay
the rooms are nice and large
and lets see i have $unc$two bedrooms
and
thats nice
do you get your own washer dryer
i have a washer and dryer area
and i did buy the washer and dryer
but they didnt provide it
oh
the one that i moved from didnt have a place to put them
and thats $unc$one of the reasons that i did move
yeah
that is nice
yeah
get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat
yeah
tell me ab-
yeah
ive always been pretty lucky
the real estate out heres been pretty good
the prices came down last year
we had sort of like a $unc$dallas syndrome
yeah
the past year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern $unc$virginia
uh-huh
its a real good
it just never happened before
so its really surprising everybody
all the developers dont know what to do
yeah
its a good time to buy if youre in the market
yeah
unfortunate-
we actually have our house on the market because we have $unc$two kids
uh-huh
and we have a $unc$three bedroom house
and its pretty much filled up right now
so you want a bigger one
yeah
uh-huh
get an extra bedroom or a basement
right now its just a single level rambler
uh-huh
$unc$one thing about the houses in $unc$dallas they dont utilize basements the way they did in $unc$new $unc$york
my parents in $unc$new $unc$york had a $unc$three family house
uh-huh
actual a
$unc$two family house where the downstairs and the second floor they had
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment
oh
and they had a basement
and they finished the basement
and they were able to rent that out also
but in $unc$dallas i just havent seen basements in houses
yeah
yeah
and ive looked at a lot of them
yeah
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there
and thats what he said was that it just wasnt something that people had down there
no
its a-
they put pools and garages on but no basements
right
i have yet to see a basement in a house
and
maybe its all the sand
is there a lot of sand in
i always think its like a desert
i dont know
$unc$dallas always
no
no
no
no
i dont see that kind of sand here
there are some areas though where they have a problem with the houses kind of sinking a little bit to the
uh-huh
the foundation is sinking or something just a little bit some more than others
but you have to know the right spot to pick where that doesnt happen
yeah
and
out here we live in what used to be a prairie or whatever a natural grasslands
uh-huh
and they
its just you go down $unc$four inches
and $unc$fourteen inches you get to sandstone
yeah
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
i see
its just solid sandstone
where did you say youre at $unc$colorado
no
$unc$virginia
$unc$virginia
$unc$virginia
thats right
yeah
its sort of unusual really
most of $unc$virginia is clay
anywhere near $unc$virginia $unc$beach
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
my folks used to live there
back before i was born they lived there
oh
uh-huh
different areas in $unc$dallas have different kind
in $unc$texas ill say
because down in east $unc$texas theres a lot of red clay
uh-huh
and in the $unc$dallas $unc$fort $unc$worth city areas you dont see that
yeah
$unc$texas is a big state
so i imagine the type of houses and things like that are truly different from area to area
yeah
but thats the same way out here
because for example we live $unc$fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds $unc$washington
uh-huh
and anything instead the highway the real estates $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollars more expensive
yeah
so i could never afford a house inside the beltway
thats why we came out here
this is called the country with only maybe $unc$twenty miles total from $unc$d $unc$c $unc$twenty-five from the city
but its considered the country since its that far out
but yeah
we live out by $unc$dulles $unc$airport
i see
yeah
and thats $unc$one of the few places still in northern $unc$virginia
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
and its still pretty rural
uh-huh
not too much of northern $unc$virginia is like that anymore
land has gotten so expensive
they just cant afford to have low income housing like that
is your house in an area by itself
no
were in a development
its not connected to another one
theres
theres another one a quarter acre away rather
but theyre not connected are they
no
huh-uh
you have to stay in $unc$one single family home
i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up
yeah
my folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids
but for the most part they always had
and $unc$pennsylvania always had a single family home
and so as soon as we could we got a single family home
uh-huh
and thats all i ever knew growing up
uh-huh
so i stayed in a townhouse for $unc$two years and then saved up enough money to get a
hello
hello
hi
this is $unc$betty
and im in $unc$richardson $unc$texas
im $unc$nola
and im in $unc$plano
okay
here we go
i guess were going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the $unc$gulf
yeah
did you push $unc$one
yeah
okay
no
i havent pushed $unc$one yet
i just
okay
but i think its
i just started doing this
so i dont know too much about it
okay
were just sort of getting acquainted here
okay
i just wanted to see if you had an opinion about this
or
uh-huh
so if thats okay with you then ill just press $unc$one
that will be fine
okay
hi
hi
good morning
if i start this i just wanted to say that $unc$one of the things that i dont think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that theyre a totally different type of people than we are
and they think differently
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours
and right now i think that thats been proven in the fact that they have just
i just think that the $unc$united $unc$states policy over there
i think we should just leave them alone
i really do in a major way because that whole region over there i think needs to settle its own differences within itself
yeah
and thats the course that they should go
we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them
but i dont think this intervention at such high levels should be going on
the thing with $unc$israel and $unc$palestine i believe that should be settled between them
and also the other thing is our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them
im talking about the whole middle ea-
and maybe this is too general
but i just believe that they do not look at democracy the same way we do
they dont understand it as we dont understand the way they live
yeah
and so trying to put a square peg in a round hole is just
i dont think that thats the way to go in this
and thats a couple thoughts on it
yeah
i guess id like you to maybe express something here
i think overall thats right
i think its kind of sad though that for generations theyve been taught to hate each other
yeah
and i-
if
somewhere in there someones going to have to learn a different way
thats
yeah
an i think that
true we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things
but at the same time i think there is a lot of good that the $unc$united $unc$states and other countries can do as far as example
and i think some different things could come from whats happened than what we expect
ye-
yeah
i guess we could be a catalyst for their change
i
the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there
and i dont think wed be talking about this the palestinian situation sort of came to a head unless there had been a war
that was $unc$one thing that came out of it good or bad
yeah
i dont judge any war as good or bad
its just a war
yeah
and i dont see any winners or losers
i just see dead bodies
im sorry
but i just think youre right
and i think maybe its at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along
its not going to be that were going to sort of tell them to go to their room
and thats going to solve the whole problem
yeah
its going to be them
but thats the type of thing they understand
yeah
they dont understand any other way
and
and so at that you have to work at their level to an extent too
its
yeah
thats true too
i
they wouldnt have understood anything than what we did in the war
yeah
they understand violence
there was nothing else
yeah
they love violent leaders to
look at the leader they had
they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel
yeah
and for a while there he had them be-
i cant figure out why they adored him
it has a lot to do with their religion
i got to say that over there
yes
yeah
and i know this only because from personal experience that im speaking of this
because ive traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where ive done that
and $unc$one of the kindest people ive ever met in my whole life is from that area of the country
and he is abounding in kindness lets say
yeah
and his wife is so godly every thought
they have a totally different life than we have
and when you add the commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them
yeah
and they have very basic life
its just a very basic life
and they just really believe in $unc$allah or $unc$god or whatever
uh-huh
and everything is to the glory of $unc$allah
and its almost like
whats sad is that the leaders that have control are power
yeah
thats using that
yeah
yes
and they abuse that
and its always been military
and its always been
and thats always been the way of the world dont you think
which i think that thats not the way the majority of the people over there really are
yeah
so its really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people
but i think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown that there are a lot of people that dont follow what those few are doing
and there are a lot of people who are good people
yeah
yeah
theres
and i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the soldiers surrendering and trying to get out of that situation
right
and surrendering
that was
yeah
and the
it just really comes down to people are people
you have to have some compassion some humanness
thats right
doesnt matter where the boundaries are
there are political boundaries
and those are man made boundaries
but for heaven sakes thats something thats been going on for ages
and i think so much of it is what youre taught
yeah
thats true
they teach their children in such a way that
hi
i guess ill just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here which means that we have $unc$eight people $unc$four couples
uh-huh
and most of the husbands
this is really peculiar
most of the husbands cook
great
the wives during the day get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day
they dont really care about gourmet stuff
but it was the guys that got together and did all this
thats nice
and my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of barbecue
and all guys i think like to barbecue
i think its caveman
right
right
im telling you
but he really does cook
and its a good thing because you cant knock that
no
but all these other guys do too
and so weve gotten together
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
and its really really kind of a neat thing to do
you
how often do you meet
we try
because everybody is so active with their kids and all that
its like if we can do it once every $unc$six months were doing well
yes
yes
yeah
so we originally started out when we were younger and didnt have so much stuff going on with the kids
uh-huh
then we tried to do it every other month
yeah
but lately its just been once every $unc$six months
oh
thats much more reasonable
i was involved in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals
yeah
and we were a little bit too frequent i think
oh
i dont remember if we were once a month
or it was difficult
by the time we went around it was $unc$four couples
so by the time we got around to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired partly because gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining
really
really
its too rich
it is absolutely
and so we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
yeah
so we kind of
and then $unc$one of the couples moved
and so we sort of didnt continue it
and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you dont have as much time for regular entertaining
but when we entertain i usually try to find something that will be kind of good for everybody
and that sometimes means you cant do gourmet because depending on who your guests are
right
yeah
yeah
thats true
and we have a gourmet friend that cant stand fish
so he can get within
yeah
$unc$one of my friends doesnt eat any cheese at all
my
so thats a real problem because so many dishes require cheese
yeah
i take that back
she cant eat some cream cheese
but that really limits
it sure d-
it makes you keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like
yeah
right
right
so we try to keep all that in mind
but otherwise i guess entertaining
i guess i have recipes
i
but thats basically what we do is the gourmet
uh-huh
so they would be pretty elaborate
yeah
but its fun
it took us $unc$four days to cook a stock and $unc$three days to make this stuff
wow
and you get all prepared
yeah
but youre right
its very very rich
and im glad we dont have it every
because its quite a treat
it really is
yeah
sounds wonderful
right
but you like food
and i just love the community of food
i just think its neat
i do too
yeah
i just love sharing meals and whatever you can do to do that
right
i dont think you have to be more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the coleslaw and potato salad
right
right
but
sure
my daughter is graduating $unc$sunday
and so were having a few people in $unc$sunday afternoon
oh
and i did a cop out on to it
im buying cold cuts
i have to make a cake
what are you providing
and i have to make $unc$hors $unc$doeuvres
and i have to make dessert
so i figured for the main thing its going to be sandwiches
right
right
there you go
so im buying the little tiny rolls and so on
but i cant do it working full-time
and its just too much
i know
were all not built like what $unc$martha $unc$stewart
those people that try to do everything
yeah
we all arent $unc$martha $unc$stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and time to t-
ugh
wouldnt that be nice
yeah
shot a video of the whole thing
i dont know
yeah
right
but its really kind of a neat thing
i get a kick out of it
i really do
everything all parts of the food
i love to make things from scratch making breads
uh-huh
yeah
and people really pretty much appreciate it
they do
its very difficult to purchase items that are as good as what you can make yourself
i think so
in spite of
or if you do buy it its extremely expensive
in fact i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts
and i bought turkey and pastrami and barbecued ham at an $unc$amish market near here
oh
and ive never been there before and found that theres individual vendors
oh
and the foods are wonderful
and $unc$one of the vendors had cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes fresh strawberry cheesecake now and so on
oh
and its like $unc$thirteen $unc$fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake which is really not such a bad price
i decided i just couldnt quite make myself buy it because i do make cheesecake
and somehow i didnt want to do that because it
there you go
but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful
and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things
oh
but those are homemade
they are not commercial bakery made
and in that they are made in their homes
so its kind of interesting
its out there if you want to pay the price
but
it is
we have bakeries around here that you just gain weight going by the door
right
just like that
just smelling the air
yeah
right
but i dont know
i guess some of the best things ive ever had some of them were just $unc$hors $unc$doeuvres
uh-huh
doing little $unc$hors $unc$doeuvre things that i have a kick making that
yeah
i get off on strange little details of food i guess
but gee we have so much going on here because this is $unc$dallas
yeah
this is the southwest
this is chips and $unc$picante sauce and anything hot
uh-huh
you can always make it hotter and lots of stuff like that
right
so thats a really good party time eating all that hot food
yeah
and they just love it down here
it just
we like hot food too
so
all the stuff that goes with that
so
right
you dont sound like youre from $unc$texas originally though
im not
thank you for noticing
im from $unc$chicago
i thought that there was a slight difference in accent
and how i got
really
and how i got to $unc$texas by way of $unc$virginia and everything is a long story
right
but
ill bet
yeah
do you have a favorite $unc$hors $unc$doeuvre recipe thats easy
or is it always complicat-
absolutely
i
in fact it just came to mind
and this
what was $unc$one of the latest ones that youve seen
i think we rented pretty woman a couple months ago
right
the last $unc$two years i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home
ive become available to come and go more often
uh-huh
so i said hey its worth it
ill just go at the matinee hour
and i can see what i please
yeah
its no more costly than renting $unc$one
the last
i went about $unc$two or $unc$three weeks ago and saw $unc$f $unc$x $unc$two
and that is a really good movie if you like special effects
kind of gory and lots of action
uh-huh
i have not done that one
i dont know if i have even heard of that one
do you know that i dont follow performers
oh
i dont follow actors
some i know
uh-huh
some i dont
yeah
and he was
he was not the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in the one about the old people
cocoon
cocoon
uh-huh
okay
he was a blond haired heavyset alien in cocoon
okay
i dont know what his name is
i think i know who you are talking about though
yeah
at any rate i also saw not long ago once around
that was with $unc$richard $unc$dreyfuss
okay
and that one was just a very poignant story
it had people
a lot of people said it was a really funny movie
but it was a poignant humor
uh-huh
and it was like steel magnolias
the characters played very well off one another
uh-huh
and there was humor involved
but the story was a very dramatic story
and i enjoyed it very much
what are some others that you have seen lately
im trying to think
just the other night on $unc$h $unc$b $unc$o we watched the $unc$hunt for red $unc$october again
whoa
yes
and thats one that
thats one i can watch over and over and over again
yeah
i was going to read while it was on
but then when it started i just couldnt read
that was a really good movie
it sure was
and the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it
there are a number of good movies like that
yeah
theres quite a few movies out now that i would like to go see
my husband is not a real big movie goer
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i guess more than anything that is why we dont go
yeah
plus by the time you get a baby-sitter and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive
uh-huh
right
you dont work
no
i stay at home
okay
you are going to have to find a mothers day out and have him call in sick $unc$one day
yeah
go during the day
thats right
thats right
theres nothing wrong with that
go in the early hours
its a matinee
its not crowded
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video
yeah
and thats the way i do it
and i go quite frequently
uh-huh
if you are going to be planning on doing that
i was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a witch hunt that is magically shot into the present time
uh-huh
and the first $unc$five minutes or $unc$ten minutes of the movie i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded
there was more gore than i was interested in seeing
uh-huh
but as the movie settles down to a comfortable action i cant really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either
but the action was comfortable
yeah
and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things
so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore
and there were some others
but they were done a little more tastefully
yeah
but in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guys finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
and i could not handle that
i said whoa im glad i have not had dinner
then i saw awakening
thats a wonderful wonderful job by $unc$robin $unc$williams and $unc$peter $unc$de $unc$niro
i
$unc$robert $unc$de $unc$niro
$unc$robert $unc$de $unc$niro
what did i say $unc$peter
i think you said $unc$peter
i said $unc$robert $unc$de $unc$niro
yeah
and he has done a really good job of characterizing the disabled person
uh-huh
and of course $unc$robin $unc$williams always just has an air about him that you cant help but enjoy what he is doing
even when hes sad you great faith that he will get happy again
uh-huh
and then lets see theres a couple or $unc$three that i would like to go see before they go into videos
i guess i can wait another month
and they will be videos
yeah
$unc$one is silence of the lambs
ive heard a lot about that one
they say if you really want some suspense thats the one to see
and i understand thats a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about $unc$two weeks ago on television
i think i read about that too
uh-huh
and then $unc$thelma and $unc$louise
i think its time we had a lady abuse the guys movie
its about time for $unc$one of those
i want to go see that
yeah
and im going to try to get in dances with wolves
you havent
ive heard that is wonderful
uh-huh
ive heard its wonderful too
but its just that they are both very long movies
yeah
and the matinee starts before i can get away from work
oh
and after that i get involved in other things and dont want to go back
yeah
yeah
ive heard thats
we rented the other one
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately was presumed innocent with $unc$harrison $unc$ford
i guess hes in there
uh-huh
and i thought that was really good
i saw that
and i cannot remember too much about it
it was the one where he was a defense
not defense
he was a prosecu-
uh-huh
and there was a murder of $unc$one of the women that was in the d a office
uh-huh
and then he ended up being accused of it
thats right
i remember now
yeah
i remember
yeah
so it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was
uh-huh
ive had a hard time enjoying $unc$harrison $unc$ford in anything since the $unc$indiana $unc$jones movies
i think he ought to stay $unc$indiana $unc$jones
i realize that he would like his career to develop
but i dont want to see him in other things
but i tell you $unc$sean $unc$connery in the hunt for red $unc$october
i never did care for him in the $unc$james $unc$bond movies
i dont know
he was too
i was never into those movies either
yeah
i didnt care for the type of movie
but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed
and i didnt like him
but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older
yeah
i thought he looked real good with a beard too
yeah
yeah
he does
and theres a
i dont know
i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not
yeah
and he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
and i enjoy those
and i enjoy some of the $unc$michael $unc$j $unc$fox movies
i didnt care too much for the last one either
it just was not enough to it
what was the last one
im trying to think
the last
back to the future then was the last one
no
no
no
it was called hard way where he was an actor trying to portray a policeman
okay
and that
hi $unc$ed
hi
hi
books
actually i am reading a couple of different books
$unc$one is a story
it is not a story
it is a collection of memos supposedly written by $unc$howard $unc$hughes
that was
it came out a couple of years ago
and i have just now gotten around to reading it
i have had it a couple years
but jus-
who wrote that
i do not remember the mans name
he used to be a reporter for i think the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times or the $unc$washington $unc$post $unc$one of the $unc$two
and he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell
and they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the corporate headquarters in $unc$los $unc$angeles
they on
i think it was $unc$romain $unc$drive or $unc$romain $unc$street or something there in $unc$los $unc$angeles
they i guess they still do had a big warehouse kind of thing which had offices
and it was sort of nondescript for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected
he was a great collector of everything
he did not throw anything away
and supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi-
he was a burglar had been breaking there awhile and had ended up
i see
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect
and they broke in $unc$one night and found a bunch of memos that were supposedly from $unc$hughes to his main assistant back in the fifties and i guess in the sixties up until his death
that is interesting
right
its pretty interesting work
so
that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
yeah
its a little hard
you have to plod through it
and it does not have a real story or any plot
uh-huh
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
and they have not made a movie of the week of it yet
no
i have not seen it
but it is real interesting
yeah
i also reading thi-
its another old book that i happen to have
i am sort of rereading it
its a book about the $unc$bermuda $unc$triangle
but its a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian
he wrote sort of debunking many of the stories about the $unc$bermuda $unc$triangle
he was thinking many of the myths of the triangle actually could be explained
explained
and the reason i picked it back up was in light of when they found the airplanes in the $unc$atlantic thinking they were $unc$flight $unc$nineteen
and i dont know if you are familiar with that at all
but its
$unc$flight $unc$nineteen was a collection of a flight of $unc$five $unc$navy adventures at the end of $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two right after $unc$world $unc$war $unc$two
and they were lost
and
supposedly scooped up by the triangle
yeah
they were
yeah
and in the book even
he wrote this book back in the seventies
and even then he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water
because he goes through and brings out points from the navys findings and so forth
and its probably real close to what everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back
yeah
on that same topic have you ever read anything about the $unc$amelia $unc$earhart story whatever happened with her
no
i have not
i think that would be
i am sure there is something out there
yeah
i would like to too
because its a lot of things coming up here lately about her possibilities of where she
i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like $unc$ten years
whatever this is $unc$one aspect of it
yeah
of course it is so weird
cause no one will ever really know
tha-
but its entertaining
and it makes you think about things
right
that is for sure
yeah
that is pretty much for right now
that is what i have been reading
yeah
i kind of like to read different stuff
and i like to read a novel every now and then
but i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
right
i guess i just have not read anyth-
usually if i find a good book i will sit for $unc$two days until it is finished if its that good
yeah
and i think the last one i read like that was $unc$scott thurows
and that was presumed innocent
yes
and i just really really liked the way he writes
its just incredible
yeah
i read that too
i got it right after it came out
my
yeah
he was an assistant district attorney in $unc$chicago while he was writing the book
and my sister-in-law lives in $unc$chicago
and before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this
this guy is from here
and i read it and really liked it
and then about
that is when it really got big
so i
that was good i think
and the other book i am trying to think was in the last year
and i think i did read $unc$tom $unc$wolfe and $unc$vanity
bonfire of the vanity
bon
yeah
i have not read that although i have heard it is pretty good
yeah
i
that was really really good
the movie was nothing compared to the book
yeah
that is what i have heard
and
yeah
i saw the movie
and
the movie was a joke compared to
because $unc$tom $unc$wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to pinpointing societys ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
yeah
right
and so it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
right
i know
and we are not talking about that
but gee i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden
and
yeah
i have a lot of computer books that
i do computer work
and so i have a lot of those
so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them
yeah
but im interested in a lot of that
but i have got a lot of books that i intend to read
but i have not been able to yet for $unc$one reason or another
what is a book on your list
i have a list too
and i have never gotten to it
gosh i do not really have a list
cause i just have all the books out
i have book shelves
and i have them all out
and usually when i am through with $unc$one i will go in and look through
i have $unc$one now and i can not remember the name of it that i got is
the sister-in-law in $unc$chicago usually for my birthday or $unc$christmas or something will send me another good book
and sh-
oh
i have $unc$one
and i can not remember the name of it
it is supposed to be a mystery
okay
okay
where have you all been on vacation recently
recently
my most recent trip was last year
and that was $unc$detroit
$unc$detroit
yeah
is that a nice vacation spot
it wasnt really
it was to see an old relative
right
okay
and it was just to have some fellowship with her
right
so you probably wouldnt recommend that as a big tourist spot
no
the only thing that i visited that is quite a tourist spot is $unc$cancun $unc$mexico
that would be nice
and that was real nice
did you scuba dive there
no
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
that would be nice
yeah
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine
that would be enjoyable
right
yeah
thats a nice break
i havent been on vacation in a while either
usually when we go we go to $unc$colorado to $unc$estes $unc$park area which is up kind of near $unc$denver and stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the $unc$texas heat that kind of thing
uh-huh
yes
thats always refreshing to get away from
so its a lot of fun
i worked up there last summer
so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long
thats nice
yeah
worked at a camp there
and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains
so thats probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation
my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity
and thats canoeing
oh
and theyve been to the $unc$guadalupe $unc$river
and they also have been to i guess $unc$colorado
and theyve really enjoyed it
thats nice
we canoed up in $unc$arkansas at the $unc$buffalo $unc$river
its a whole new
uh-huh
and thats the best place that ive ever canoed
its really really pretty
i was a little kid then
and we to have
we stayed at some park
and they had a little mountain man who came down the river every night
and he would give a little talk about mountain things
i think he wasnt a real mountain man
but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that hed come in his little log boat down the river
sure
uh-huh
and wed
and hed make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that hed found
and thats a good family place to go
thats neat
sure
and then the river was really nice because it wasnt too frightening
but it wasnt too easy either
uh-huh
it was like
you learn a lot of skills too
and i think youre more receptive when youre younger than when youre older to learn new skills
thats true
and i think it really penetrates in your memory what to do because you really have a great interest in it because its something you werent forced to do
uh-huh
right
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
yeah
and youre more receptive
thats good
we lets see
the only other place ive ever vacationed wed go on camping trips up to $unc$texoma and things like that
uh-huh
and then i went to $unc$england a few years ago
thats exciting
i was a student there and spent a semester studying abroad in $unc$london
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that was a great time because thats such a neat place
and theres not a language barrier
so you dont
theres a little bit because theres some of those english words that you just dont exactly know what they mean
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents
but it was really fun
i really enjoyed that
im probably going back there to work for a year
uh-huh
i had a friend that visited $unc$england i think its been probably $unc$two years now
but thats her next goal and she can do it is go back to $unc$england
because she really has a great desire to do that
because the love that she has for it now after visiting it
its really nice
i would spend all my time in $unc$london or most of my time
uh-huh
and it was really different being in a big city
because i dont get much into really urban areas a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate
but it ended up being kind of nice because youre not accountable to anyone
uh-huh
uh-huh
you could just kind of walk around and observe
do your own thing
yeah
i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people
uh-huh
and i had a great time doing that
it was really interesting
thats wonderful
theres a lot out there to see
yeah
i know
ill say
i keep wanting to get up to
i havent been anywhere else outside the $unc$united $unc$states
i havent been to $unc$mexico or $unc$canada or
i lived across the street almost from $unc$canada
oh
so thats a nice place
$unc$canada is very nice
yeah
that would be nice
i had a friend from there
uh-huh
then id love to go somewhere in $unc$asia
but id have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that
yes
absolutely
sure
somebody that knows their way around
so yeah
thats why $unc$england was nice
even we traveled in $unc$europe for about a week
and that was even nice because there wasnt the
we went to $unc$germany and $unc$switzerland and
youve been quite a few places there
yeah
we have
we whirlwinded through $unc$europe
once you think about it
uh-huh
it was just insane $unc$twelve days where wed just stop like a city a day
and you slept on the train at night
thats great
but there wasnt a
it was strange
it was kind of sad
there wasnt ever a language problem there because everyone in $unc$germany knew $unc$english
and everyone in $unc$switzerland knew $unc$english
uh-huh
thats great
so we were kind of pitiful
we found $unc$one restaurant we were in and got seated
and then no one knew $unc$english in there
and we finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things
uh-huh
but it was
what did you wind up with
i had fondue
that was easy to say
okay
tried to get fondue and white wine
and that was
uh-huh
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly
there were some people at the next table who spoke $unc$english
so we elicited their aid for a while
they kind of guided you
and they were very helpful
uh-huh
so it was a pleasant time
good
id love to go back there
theres just not time
theres not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything
i guess thats why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time well have the means to pursue our dreams
right
thats
yeah
i guess thats what retirement is all about
that and sleeping late
yes
i keep hoping for
uh-huh
it was nice talking with you
i understand that
it was nice talking with you too $unc$craig
and have a good afternoon
you do the same
okay
thank you
good-bye
bye-bye
okay
do you keep a family budget
or do you have some
no
i dont use a family budget
my father who is very old has kept $unc$one his entire life
uh-huh
and i probably rebelled against it
i probably should have kept $unc$one
he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage
interesting
yes
we sort of started doing it years and years ago
and my husband started graduate school when we were first married
and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and never have gotten out of it
i cannot really say that its a formal budget
its more just a fairly accurate recording of what i spend and what i think i am going to have to spend
right
and
i think it makes much more sense
yeah
and i have recently gotten out of debt and everything
and i will probably start keeping a little better track of it
yeah
yeah
i just spent whatever came in and never knew what came in and what went out about like the government runs
right
yeah
that sounds real similar
i think it is probably better to have at least a record
but my dad was so precise that if it said to spend $unc$eleven percent on something thats what it was spent
and that was put over there
my
yeah
and of course he is from the depression
and so its his life
yeah
sure
but i think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them
yeah
i think you are right
it must have been sort of interesting to us
its because since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last $unc$fifteen years i guess i can go back and look
and its real fun to just see how things have changed over the years
yeah
it is
for instance
im a historian
and my father had kept them i think since $unc$nineteen $unc$twenty-seven
but he burned the ones from $unc$twenty-seven to $unc$fi-
my goodness
i could not believe he did that
so i took the ones from $unc$fifty-two on to the present
dear
yes
but to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that
yes
but
as a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago i guess it has been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had
and she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties when they
uh-huh
it was the late
i guess i will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married probably $unc$fifteen years at the time
and it was just fascinating to see how little things cost
it was just almost laughable in some instances that
oh
of course its all relative of course
i know
right
but never the less it was fun to see those figures next to
for a pair of shoes was $unc$five dollars
and
i know
even in $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty-three
i found a record that i had i travel in $unc$europe a lot what i had paid for hotels
and a similar hotel in $unc$paris is $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars a night now
oh
and i paid between $unc$four and $unc$five dollars in $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty
isnt that something
and thats really crazy
cause thats about $unc$thirty years ago
really
that is really something
but of course its just what the market will bear
thats true
if people will pay $unc$two $unc$hundred then why charge $unc$ten
yeah
thats right
thats just good old economics working
right
right
we have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids
but our $unc$two children are just as unlike as night and day
and our son could care less about a budget
uh-huh
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost just sounds like your father
she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
then you never know how they will
$unc$one
they may flip flop when they get to be older
yes
right
yes
the other one may be very careful
yes
and she may marry somebody
and of course it would be good because you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching
yeah
you should have $unc$one in the house
i think that is true
i
and i think that is probably what happened in our house
and i think
because i think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married
and i was really diligent about that
i was putting money aside before i was married when i was working out of college
and that really paid off
yeah
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts
and
yeah
thats about the way it is here
yeah
if it had not been for my wife i would have probably been in debtors prison if we had one
but what does you husband do now
he is an engineer
he is an electrical engineer and in fact went through many years of graduate school and got his $unc$p $unc$h $unc$d
oh
so we had a lot of years of budgeting
yeah
you have to do it when you are in school
and
yeah
when you
my wife is still in school getting her doctorate
yes
and it
im working on my masters degree now
and i have got
so in fact this last year we had $unc$three
both of the children were in college
our son has a year left
and our daughter graduated this year
and im just about ready to finish my masters degree
so we have had once again a real lean year for us
i know
we had $unc$three in college plus my wife
but
so that was $unc$four
yeah
so we were both in the same
yeah
yeah
you know exactly what its like then
yeah
yeah
and its
which you learn
i guess you figure that that is an investment that is really invaluable
that is the best one
uh-huh
yeah
with education you cant take that away from you
yeah
that is right
its one that you can live through
and i think that thats the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel that it was worth it to save and to not have something and in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
right
sure
so it really makes it easier
yeah
thats true
but i have enjoyed talking with you $unc$jerry
i have enjoyed talking with you $unc$kathy
and i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me
i am interested in that
if i had your address i would send you
i am also in the travel business
i do tours
oh
and i can take some real great tours to $unc$europe
so if you
wow
my husband and i just went there last year
we did not take a tour
we were in $unc$england and went to $unc$ireland and $unc$scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own
yeah
but i
that sounds interesting
is your business in $unc$dallas then
yeah
its here in $unc$dallas
okay
in the $unc$quorum
im $unc$jerry $unc$hammond
and im out at $unc$brookhaven $unc$college
so you could just holler at me there
you are kidding
yeah
im going to be teaching at $unc$brookhaven in the fall
all right
what is your last name
$unc$kuenzer $unc$k $unc$u $unc$e $unc$n $unc$z $unc$e $unc$r
and im
$unc$k $unc$u $unc$e $unc$n
uh-huh
$unc$z $unc$e $unc$r
and i will be in the communications department teaching $unc$english $unc$one oh $unc$one to
good
i will
i have a couple of sections
i know $unc$zack $unc$miller real well
yes
yeah
thats the guy who hired me
yes
wonderful
i will look you up in the fall then
fantastic
okay
its been a good type conversation
bye-bye
bye-bye
how do you view this whole subject
are you one who feels like you have benefited from the change in roles in women
or what do you think
yeah
i
yeah
i think so
uh-huh
yeah
theres been a lot of changes
i think theres still a lot to be made though
yes
yes
i think so
uh-huh
are you someone who works outside your home
or have you
yeah
yeah
i work for $unc$t $unc$i
yes
uh-huh
have there been significant changes do you think in the employment place especially say at $unc$t $unc$i
uh-huh
has anything in particular changed that you have noticed during your time there
i guess theres more women in what would be classified as a mans job
yeah
uh-huh
what kind of work do you do
i am a drafter
uh-huh
i am in a mans job
right
but we have got more women in it now
yes
yes
theres a lot of us in it
yes
yes
in years past i know in fact even the word drafter has changed
because it used to be they were draftsman
uh-huh
we have some engineers that still on the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman
right
and i want to scratch it out and put drafter
but i thought i am not going to do that
maybe not
when i was in college
i graduated from college with my bachelors degree in $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty-four
uh-huh
and i was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time
yeah
yeah
so i was in a lot of classes where i was either the only girl or $unc$one of just a very few women in the class
uh-huh
uh-huh
so that was a change
and even i did not use my math in my work
i became a technical writer
uh-huh
but even so there were very very few women in technical writing
yeah
but that has changed a lot
yeah
in recent years it has just really changed a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think that the $unc$one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management
but i think they have got a long way to go
definitely
definitely
there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than $unc$one or $unc$two percent of the chair persons if you will of the board are women in this country
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i thought that thats a pretty significantly small number
yeah
so there are some strides to be made there
yeah
yeah
but i do not know
i think we have come a long way actually when i think about when things were like just when i was in high school and how it is now for girls
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and i guess my $unc$one bad thing is that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because i think she would have succeeded in a lot of ways that women were not able to succeed in her generation
yeah
do you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
do you have children
no
huh-uh
i was going to say do you have daughters
thats always a good question
do you
yes
in fact i have a daughter who just graduated in civil engineering from college
wonderful
although there were some other women in her class she was $unc$one of the minorities females in the class
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so she definitely entering into a male profession
yeah
but for instance there is the organization the $unc$society of $unc$women $unc$engineers
yeah
uh-huh
so that is recognized as a place where women should be
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i do not know
you see it in church where more and more women are becoming ministers in protestant congregations
yeah
and it will be interesting to see if $unc$roman $unc$catholicism ever recognizes women in the role of priest
i do not know if you are $unc$roman $unc$catholic or what you know about that
no
huh-uh
uh-huh
i am not either
but that is $unc$one area that i can see might change but i really doubt will change
yeah
yeah
not for a long time anyway
no
probably not
huh-uh
what in particular would you think other than the work place where women still are being found wanting or not as highly regarded as men would be
i was just trying to think
i know something
uh-huh
maybe you could te-
tell me what you think about this
uh-huh
the role of women in combat roles during the war
oh
because i know that now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the only branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the $unc$air $unc$force
and i spoke because women were flying missions in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf war
yeah
yeah
but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
it was real interesting
i was listening to some of the comments on television the other day about it
uh-huh
and $unc$one of the men who was a
i do not know if he was a general or what his rank was very high
uh-huh
he said its just a personal thing with me
i can not tell you why i feel this way
but i just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman
i thought at least he was honest
but that does not sit very well with a lot of folks i am sure
theres some men out there that are more feminine than most women
yeah
right
$unc$neil $unc$as far as i am concerned and i could be wrong about this the only $unc$one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something
yeah
yeah
yeah
because mentally and emotionally i think women can handle a job and every bit as well
i do too
so its still
uh-huh
uh-huh
and if she wanted to go to combat i do not see that they should stop her
sure
i personally would not want to go
but
no
i would not either
no
i agree
but i am sure that there are women who would relish that kind of job
yeah
yeah
so i guess that should be taken into consideration as well
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
this is an interesting topic
i have
having a daughter who has gone into engineering i sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than i did
uh-huh
uh-huh
shes a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than i think i was
good
so thats progress i guess
yeah
i have enjoyed talking with you $unc$lisa
and have you talked with a lot of people in this project
same here
or
i am not at home a lot
yeah
i am at work right now
yeah
i put my work number
but at home the recorder gets my calls
yeah
usually i am not there
right
but i probably talked to $unc$seven or $unc$eight people
yeah
thats great
uh-huh
thats good
i personally have not made any calls yet myself
it never crosses my mind
yeah
yeah
but i enjoy receiving them
yeah
thats good
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats good
because i guess i placed all but $unc$one or $unc$two of my calls and only because i going to make some money
uh-huh
uh-huh
see our choir is doing this as a money raising project
uh-huh
we got the connection through a $unc$t $unc$i church member
uh-huh
and so we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church
uh-huh
and i feel like this is $unc$one way i can contribute thats not too painful financially painful anyway
yeah
thats wonderful
its just real nice that way
so i thought i will just get on the stick and do it
yeah
thats great
i will say good-bye to you
okay
but i have enjoyed the conversation
thanks for calling
thank you
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye-bye
hi $unc$pat
hi
$unc$one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the leave it to $unc$beaver housewives
uh-huh
but we are not living in that world
we are certainly not
our families have changed
uh-huh
families
uh-huh
society has changed
yeah
sure
everything has changed
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
thats $unc$one of the
and it makes you really concerned
i am glad i raised guys
uh-huh
let the world train them what to do
but characteristically the women or have been in the past trained in the home
uh-huh
and i really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl
i think i would
yeah
its
even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to
sure
uh-huh
used to be they would just go off to work and come home
and everything was done
and its a different world
its some good some bad
sure
uh-huh
its nice that theres a choice
i have chosen to stay at home and raise my children
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i have a $unc$ten year old and a $unc$twelve year old
uh-huh
and i was a single parent for awhile and worked
uh-huh
and that was great
and i was able to provide for my children
and that was wonderful
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i thank $unc$god everyday now that i have that choice and that i am able to do things at home
sure
and i volunteer a whole lot
uh-huh
and thats my job right now
uh-huh
and i love it
yeah
i really love it
i did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said $unc$mom please do not be involved
right
right
then i went back to work
right
and that will come
yeah
i know that day will come
sure
and i am looking forward to that too
right
but thats a different phase in my life
right
and i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now
theres a lot of things that have happened
and its like oil on top of water
it changes
but its never different in a lot of ways
uh-huh
uh-huh
women at $unc$one time did very heavy physical labor and were expected to maintain a household
uh-huh
uh-huh
then as times changed as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in housekeeping and homemaking
uh-huh
right
right
theres not a lot of physical labor because there are
right
you are not beating rugs
uh-huh
you are not doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
right
and in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion
uh-huh
or we really do develop some health problems
uh-huh
so in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit
yeah
yeah
and
but dont you think its that way with men too
men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more than they used to
absolutely true
thats true with society in general
yeah
yeah
but specifically the womans role in society has changed
uh-huh
and medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases
right
right
heart disease was characteristic of men
right
now theres almost equally predominant in women
right
and i
and stress disorders and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and i think that thats a symptom of our society
its a symptom that theres a general illness that needs to be healed
uh-huh
i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem
i am not $unc$god
yeah
yeah
but i do know that in raising my boys i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you need to get them into music lessons
you need to get them into sports
uh-huh
uh-huh
you need to get them into this
they need to be busy
and they need to be active
and i fought all of those things
i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me
and they will say $unc$mom this is important to me
i want to do it
right
right
otherwise i will guard their ability to have quiet time
its funny
i refused to cram their lives full
yeah
yeah
its funny
its funny
i was really looking forward to summer thinking we are going to have some time off
and thats the way it is with a woman too
uh-huh
and its been real busy
and today is really as far as i am concerned the first day of summer because we have had so much going on the past few weeks
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you are right
uh-huh
thats how society has changed
uh-huh
uh-huh
the family has changed
we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids
uh-huh
i do not remember being involved in things like this
uh-huh
its different
uh-huh
its just
i do not know
only time will tell whether its better or worse than the way we grew up
uh-huh
but its just very different
of course
uh-huh
i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time
if you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i guarded my childrens rights for that
and i think that thats $unc$one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do
uh-huh
they are sacrificing their time with themselves
theres nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self
right
right
right
you are finding out who you are
but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done
i think
and where do you find the time
in the first place its not your homework
its your childrens homework
uh-huh
and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help
uh-huh
i helped them with exactly what they asked for
and thats all
yeah
thats a part of the problem that women have always had
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other peoples responsibilities
thats very true
they
and then that way we have not changed in hundreds of years have we
thats right
yeah
that way husbands are crippled
yeah
they are intellectual cripples
uh-huh
and so are children
uh-huh
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves
uh-huh
i do not know why $unc$god made women brilliant
i
didnt he though
yes
but i do not know
they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems
they are all things to all people
thats very true
and thats never changed
thats very true
as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home
and when her family comes to her and says fix this
i am having a problem with another member of the family
uh-huh
uh-huh
she said i have taken a new stance
and i say no
i will not
uh-huh
you work it out for yourself
uh-huh
and its amazing she said
uh-huh
every single person in this family expects me to get
and they suck me into these arguments and these conversations
thats right
and i am supposed to be the one who is going to fix it all and soothe everybody
and she said i am not doing it anymore
i just
i think thats $unc$one of the things that we have today that is very useful
and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it
and that is mediation training
uh-huh
we are not talking about strikes or things
we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives boss and employee those kinds of things interpersonal mediation
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
were to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis
and probably the first question would be whether youve ever had to go through that process
not so much personally
but my husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother always lived in the same town and took care of him and such
they live down in $unc$college $unc$station where his parents do too
and they put her in a home last year
uh-huh
she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to not be able to be in her apartment on her own
uh-huh
so they found a place nearby that they put her in last year
it was pretty much a physical decision
yeah
although she is in pretty good health and doesnt take any medication
its just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point
then she was starting to lose memory sometimes which is kind of frightening when shes in the car
yeah
my husbands family are reaching that point
but its so difficult
was she in favor of it
or was she kind of opposed to it
yeah
when it finally came down to it she just got to the point after the
it wasnt a very strong stroke
it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasnt herself anymore
uh-huh
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own
she never really ate very well
it was $unc$one thing
she hardly ever took care of herself
yeah
and she didnt eat
she ate very poor
so i think she was bad nutrition on top of it
and she got to the point she didnt want to alone anymore
so
so often i think though elderly people dont realize that their diet is that bad
i work with a lot of elderly people
im a trust officer
and so often they think theyre adequately caring for themselves when theyre really not eating very balanced meals
she was almost ridiculous
shed eat ice cream and cookies
shed
yes
thats part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste
didnt $unc$one
it really is
really
yeah
uh-huh
she didnt want to cook for herself anymore
yeah
thats too much trouble
thats too much trouble
didnt want to cook
and the portions
people dont want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals
i do that right now
yeah
and im not near nursing home age
although theyve got $unc$meals on $unc$wheels which i understand is a really good way to handle that so that at least they eat
yeah
uh-huh
so as a family you all just visited nursing homes
or probably in $unc$college $unc$station there wasnt a whole lot of choice
no
i dont think there was
i know a little bit more from a co-worker
her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in
uh-huh
she was ambulatory
and so there was a lesser care
then she got hip broken
and then she wasnt as ambulatory
so they were almost to the point of saying she cant be here anymore
uh-huh
but i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the $unc$arkansas $unc$house i think out in $unc$arlington something like that
uh-huh
and the type of facilities whether its a shared room or $unc$two separate rooms that share a bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
yeah
thats a given
theyre always saying that somebodys going to
and some of them i think unconsciously do it as a just half seni-
uh-huh
and sometimes the help there does it i think
so they dont have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste
uh-huh
but at least they all seem to have people that monitor their medication intake and dining facilities go to the dining room and eat some good meals
uh-huh
i know when my friends mother-in-law first went in very antisocial
maybe it takes a while for them to say okay ill be with other people
but
adapt
yeah
i dont understand that they dont want to be with anybody else
yeah
as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business
and ive seen so many elderly people
usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if you dont make the decisions so late that youre worried about money
but the places like $unc$presbyterian $unc$village and some of the retirement places where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting
uh-huh
theyre able to move in while theyre still independent and still social
uh-huh
and they do group things
and then if health or mental capacity deteriorates theyre able to take the next steps without so much change
and i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home theyve always been in
its really kind of difficult
yeah
i have a
my aunts mother is gotten ill recently
and she lives in $unc$pennsylvania
they live in $unc$alabama
and theyre saying hey we need you to be closer
and you have women like that
yeah
i dont to men
it seems like the women just out live their husbands but very reluctantly
that whole
uh-huh
they dont get out of the house
they dont socialize
but its my home
and i dont want to leave it
and its the first step in actually accepting that you are failing and aging
once you make that step you know that its just going to be downhill from then on
and ive seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change
they became
in fact thats probably whats going to happen with my husbands mother
shes going to endanger herself before shell willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision
and that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something
but its so lonely
they cant get out and see anyone
and its hard for someone like me to understand that
yeah
because i think what do you have there
its a house
uh-huh
its walls
and its furniture
but theres nobody there
not as independence
dont you want to be close to me be with other people
yeah
i just dont understand why they so much want to just stay in that building
uh-huh
uh-huh
and theres no family there
they dont get to see their grandkids
they dont get to see their children
they just there in that house
yeah
and the quality of life really isnt there
yeah
its tough
it really is
thats from the childs standpoint
the child is going why dont you want to be close to me and your other family
uh-huh
what does that house got attraction
they fear being dependent on somebody
i know theyre really proud of independence
they fear being a burden to family members
my husbands mother will have major surgery
and well find out about it in a casual conversation
shell let something slip
and well say wait a minute
and thats it
she just
i didnt want to bother you
she cant accept that we want to be the care givers
when she got home who took care of her
yeah
she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay
oh
its just
but its frightening to us because we live pretty far from her
shes down in $unc$temple
uh-huh
and we cant see her often enough to really know whats going on
so its difficult
it really is
and were all heading that way
and
yeah
my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in $unc$college $unc$station
and weve pretty much planned that well be here in the $unc$dallas area
and theres nothing to hold them there in $unc$college $unc$station since theyre retired
uh-huh
so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here
yeah
okay
were talking about capital punishment
right
how do you feel about that $unc$lenore
i am very much for capital punishment
wonderful
i am too $unc$one $unc$hundred percent
my $unc$dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus
uh-huh
and ive been raised around prisons all my life
all your life
uh-huh
and i believe if you dont have a punishment befitting the crime theres not any deterrent
theres no deterrent
thats right
theres just no deterrent
thats right
and so many of those kind of people they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway
so unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i dont think
especially not a federal prison
right
i dont know what oklahomas laws are
but texass i dont know are
i dont know
its no ones f-
its not the judges fault i dont think
its just the way the law is down here
man our prisons are so crowded that they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to $unc$two
the states prisons were under a mandate to
it was over crowded
and the federal came in and said hey you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
thats what ours did same thing
and finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose under early bail or early get out
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but we have
the death penalty is not given often
huh-uh
but there have been w-
its not here either really
and i
maybe it should be given i wont say sparingly
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
i do too
but the way the courts are set up theyve got so many chances for appeal
but i think it needs to be expedited
if theyve been convicted and given an appeal and theyre still convicted of a crime thats deserving of a lethal injection lets do it and not waste so many years to do it
right
of course theyre entitled to a speedy trial
thats right
but then theyre also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals
uh-huh
uh-huh
so somehow it doesnt really balance out too much
yeah
thats right
somehow it just doesnt
it works and then again it takes too long for it to work
and it seems even though that they got
the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey im tired
i just want out
uh-huh
im tired of fighting it
uh-huh
then the system just keeps on
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it equ-
and at that point i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process
i do too
i think that needs to
and i dont see why it couldnt be shortened considerably
but
part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
yea-
thats true
it is overcrowded because theres so much problem with the people on drugs
because that ha-
with the drugs theyre robbing and killing
and thats why its filled the prisons up so much i think
it doesnt help them any at all
no
it doesnt
and of course your court system when you get into the appeals
i dont believe criminal is in a court by itself
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldnt be in there
yeah
thats true
with all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things
but
weve gotten into a very litigious type of life
boy havent that we though
we really have
but anyway im glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment
i just
im very muchly for it
always have been
always will be
i just feel like their crime and punishment
and if you dont have the punishment you double your crime
and that is just personal feeling
its not going on facts
i think the facts would probably back it up
it could be supportive
its supported with facts though
but
what
it could very easily be supported with facts
yes
i
tell me some about your camping experiences $unc$carolyn
i have gone to girls camp a few times as a chaperon or a leader whatever
okay
and i enjoy camping
i
we have a tent
and weve gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove
i guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death
we just didnt take enough blankets and whatever
where do you go camping at around here
we went camping at $unc$lake $unc$bonham which is pretty close here
we went fairly early in the season for this area which is probably $unc$april is when we went
okay
and it got really cold at night
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
sure
but
what activities do you do when youre camping
we take little nature hikes
and we take along games that we can play with the kids and just that kind of stuff
usually try to have occasionally a camp fire at night and roast the marshmallows and what all
uh-huh
that sounds like fun
i grew up in $unc$south $unc$dakota up in the $unc$black $unc$hills
oh
and so we used to go camping
my dad would take us
there was $unc$four of us kids
hed take us
and wed all go camping my dad and my mom and the kids
and it was always fun
because what i always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot
and hed always tell us okay look for a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents
and it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing
and hopefully wed catch our supper
but we never did
but it was always fun
wed always
mom was always prepared
and shed bring along something because tradition had it we would never catch anything
so we always had something along to eat
but then wed roast marshmallows
and it was always an enjoyable experience
about $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-two i moved from $unc$rapid $unc$city in the $unc$black $unc$hills
i crossed the state to $unc$aberdeen
and theres no hills
its flat
and then i was in high school
and couple of my high school friends and i wed go camping out by a river of course and go fishing
but by then of course i was able to catch some things
but it was always fun
it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river
uh-huh
in the hills we would do like you folks did would take the nature hikes and look for animals
and we always
in the hills you can see quite a few different animals
but
go ahead
we used to live in $unc$utah
okay
and of course theres lots of mountains around there to camp in and streams and stuff
thats a great place to go camping
and the hiking is just really great
hike up those mountains is just really fantastic
sure
are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area
im not acquainted with any
i
theres woods and things out in $unc$east $unc$texas $unc$tyler area
okay
theres a $unc$tyler $unc$state $unc$park thats really a nice camping area
but its just a lot of trees
its not
i dont know of any place in $unc$texas that has really big what i call mountains
uh-huh
i
the $unc$rocky $unc$mountains are so much bigger than anything that theyve got down here that
right
the $unc$one in $unc$tyler has it been pretty commercialized i suppose
no
its not too bad
they have screened in areas
theyre not really cabins i wouldnt say
i guess they could call them that but theyre more just a screened in camping area whatever
okay
theyre not bad
helps keep the pests out i suppose
yeah
yeah
that sounds
i dont know if i can rate camping
but it sure beats driving a $unc$thousand miles to find a mountain i guess
yeah
thats right
i take it you havent done a whole lot of camping in this area
no
we just moved down in $unc$june
i see
youre just trying to get over the culture shock still
yeah
im still trying to find my way around
if i can get on $unc$central from anywhere im happy
yeah
yeah
really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and in the fall
okay
it just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly
theres a lot
okay
what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day
i dont like it when people listen to my phone conversations like if theyre outside my door while im talking in my room or when people look through my things in my bedroom
yeah
thats right
that is really an invasion of privacy
yeah
i find it very annoying when ive worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and
uh-huh
does that happen in your part of the country
yes
uh-huh
i come home
definitely
and i am trying to get a few things done
and i cant do anything but answer the telephone
right
some evenings are worse than others
but i wish i could put a stop to it
but i dont know what to do to stop it
right
even we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting
and they would still come to our door and knock and
uh-huh
they would think it didnt mean them i guess
i guess not
no
everybody but me
yeah
goodness
do you live at home with your parents
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
yeah
mostly
yeah
what can you do to stop that
i dont know
i am used to it now
but sometimes it sort of gets to me
but there is not much i can really do
no
no
just have to live with it i guess
yeah
try to remember to respect their privacy
and maybe they will respect yours
and
i dont know
i always
do you have brothers
no
yes
i do
but they dont live at home
okay
i was ra-
i had $unc$two younger brothers
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations
and
i used to do that though because i was the youngest
i would pick up the phone and listen to theirs
but i
i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldnt hear me
and then they would go get on the other extension
oh
and i could hear them
but i couldnt get them to hang up
yeah
but i stopped doing that a long time ago
and they still do it to me
even in the office i find that people walk up and when youre on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy theyll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up
s-
yeah
this lady does that to me at work when im taking an order or something
uh-huh
and shell just sit there and listen like im doing something wrong
and she just started
and she is nice
but
okay
but it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do
yeah
but i-
lets see i cant think of anything else id really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors
no
about the only thing that really bothers me i dont have that many people coming to my door
right
occasionally well have a person here or there but not as many as the phone calls
uh-huh
but
and i guess thats really the thing that really bugs me the most
i cant think tha-
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me
but theyve all gotten grown up now
and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up
oh
but what else would be an annoyance
i guess traffic could be an annoyance
yeah
especially when youre in a hurry
do you have a lot of traffic in your area
it can get busy
yeah
usually in the week im
uh-huh
some days its real real bad here
and you would like to feel like its an invasion of privacy because you cant even ride down the road without people all the way around you
yeah
uh-huh
but
yeah
ive traveled quiet a bit
and ive been through $unc$dallas $unc$texas
its pretty busy
it really is
and pretty noisy
yeah
it really is
yeah
i live right on a main thoroughfare
so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy
because at first youd hear a lot of noise especially at night when you go to bed
uh-huh
yeah
and every time a fire truck or anything went down the road i would wake up
but i guess i have gotten used to it because i dont even hear it anymore
yeah
i suppose you do
and i just close it out i guess because i dont remember waking up in several years at night when id hear a fire truck go by
uh-huh
yeah
i think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me
yeah
i am a real solid sleeper though
so that probably wouldnt bother me
id sleep right through it
they would have to chop down the door and get you out i guess
yeah
it takes a lot
lets see what else is an invasion
i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes $unc$one time
oh
i was mad because those were mine
did you have has name all over them
no
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine
i was upset because those were mine
and i thought he
that was yours
yeah
right
i thought he would respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me
yeah
so that was upsetting
i was mad about that and my privacy there
yeah
i guess social change takes in a big category
but i guess the $unc$one aspect of it that i took in consideration is more economical
i know that how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has greatly changed
yes
i agree
i know they did a
it was on a talk show
they took the parents and then the son
and they compared income at different points in time when the father was a little bit younger and more in his heyday
uh-huh
and they compared to the sons that he was making now
and even though the son was probably more successful higher up in the management ladder he was actually making less money when you go by costs of living
right
right
uh-huh
and its depending on where you live though too
yeah
i know just with me $unc$ten years ago i was comparing the
i think i was living better $unc$ten years ago than i am now even though im making more money now
but my dollar went a lot farther
yeah
thats true
$unc$ten years ago i was $unc$eleven
i remember though buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now and gas
yeah
and i used to hear stories from my grandpa
and he could see a movie for a nickel and things like that
yeah
i know gas prices have definitely jumped from
i know i used to pay $unc$twenty-five cents a gallon
and now its over a buck
yeah
i dont know what its by you
around here $unc$minnesota $unc$wisconsin area its dropping
but i think its about a dollar $unc$fifteen on an average
yeah
im from $unc$wisconsin
yeah
okay
thats unu-
most of the people i talk to are $unc$texas
so
yeah
i spoke to a person from $unc$texas too
yeah
this is only my second phone call
so im waiting for mine
oh
i suppose this will be towards my last one pretty soon
so theyll stop me
but im pretty much out to the things to say
like social changes
yeah
and i dont think this would have anything to do with it
but clothing and styles lot of those changed
okay
yeah
i dont think they consider
like i say its a broad category
its just im not economical
but even attitudes on clothing and stuff i know
yeah
uh-huh
definitely
towards each other
yeah
i know a lot of the things that men wear nowadays would have been considered feminine many years ago
but i know it was hard for me at first
uh-huh
yeah
but now i kind of like a lot of the bright colors
yeah
i used to be more conservative and just your basic colors
but now i do like some of these brighter fluorescent colors
yeah
but styles come and go all the time though
its just ridiculous fads in and out
and even clothing from the sixties came back
yeah
i see a lot of girls wearing sixties clothes
yeah
i guess the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies of course is the mini skirt of course $unc$one of the nice things
but
yeah
i dont think that theres anything as original
its all based on $unc$one of the past styles
they just make their circle and come back again
yeah
so if you hang onto your clothes long enough theyll be back in style in a few years
yeah
thats true
maybe some day i probably wont be alive to see it
but prices might go down lot more
yeah
i dont know though
doesnt look good
thinking back i think the only style i hope doesnt come back is bell bottoms
yeah
i remember that
i do
i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say god
yeah
i didnt really care for them either
but now i
i was going to say my college is $unc$northern $unc$state $unc$university in $unc$aberdeen $unc$south $unc$dakota
and our head football coach $unc$dennis $unc$muir used to be an assistant coach at $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
really
i thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence
you went to what college
$unc$northern $unc$state $unc$university in $unc$aberdeen $unc$south $unc$dakota
and what did you graduate in
i ju-
in what major or what year
yeah
major
international business
really
yeah
and you
im going to $unc$b $unc$y $unc$u
and im going into nursing
okay
so
that sounds interesting
how long of a program is that
forever
seems like anyways
its about $unc$five years
but its probably going to take me longer because i didnt decide to major in that until about a year and a half after i was already in school
so
i read a study once
and it said that like $unc$thirty-four percent of college students actually graduate in $unc$four years from a $unc$four year program
really
that sounds
it took me $unc$five years
yeah
you get started
and you change your mind
or you want to pick up a second major
if youre management you thought ill take that marketing
it only was $unc$three more classes
yeah
and just doesnt happen that you get out in $unc$four years
uh-huh
but
what is your advice to picking a college
my advice is look at the student to faculty ratio
if youre going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is $unc$three and $unc$four $unc$hundred to $unc$one i dont think youre going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if youre down to the $unc$thirty to $unc$forty to $unc$one
uh-huh
what was yours more like
yeah
was there a
it was about $unc$twenty-six to $unc$one
really
yeah
thats great
which is
its interesting
but its
what i thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor
and they knew you
uh-huh
you werent just in their class
and so you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time
or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you could sit down talk to them about a problem
theyre always willing to help you out
but i put that against my high school where we had a biology class of $unc$three $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty students
and
wow in high school
yeah
oh
it was a biology lecture class
wow
and it just wasnt the same
youre sitting there
and youre taking notes
and you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because theres no way they could correct a $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$fifty person short answer test
uh-huh
and it just wasnt the same
youd pass the teacher in high school
and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless youre in that biology class
and theyd look at you like do i know you
or should i know you
uh-huh
yeah
its
the classes here are pretty big
so its hard to get individual help
its kind of youre on your own
do you get a lot of tutoring
or
no
very little
my
for example im in a chemistry class right now
uh-huh
and theres tons of students in it
and theres $unc$one t a for the whole class
and he only has certain office hours
and so theres only certain times you can talk to him
and
and you could get there
and he could have a $unc$nine to $unc$eleven in the morning office hours and have $unc$forty-two people waiting to talk to him
and you still didnt get to talk to him anyway
right
yeah
what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college
man i think your advice is good
lets see my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college
thats excellent advice
because i didnt
and i took tons of classes that i didnt need to
and i dont know
i just feel like its going to take me a lot longer than
and not thats always bad
but its
i dont know
its frustrating i guess
it does get it
you get to the point where im never going to get done
right
i was taking summer classes
and let me get out of here
yep
but no
thats good advice
even if you dont have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want
you dont want management
but you think you want business
yes
i havent talked to anybody outside the $unc$metroplex
so i didnt even think of saying $unc$arlington $unc$texas
this is a real first
yes
are you at work
yes
i am
ive been trying to get people at $unc$five $unc$thirty and $unc$six $unc$thirty in the evening
and i thought im not having any luck
ill try the middle of the afternoon
im happy we got through
i am too
do you have any opinion on the subject
im especially interested with whats happening in the $unc$soviet $unc$union
the ukraines vote basically to secede and set itself up independently is quite a remarkable counts
democracy
oh
is that reported in the $unc$texas papers
sure
we hear a little of the news
yeah
i have heard about that the last couple of days
how big is the $unc$ukraine the area
do you know
as an area its not
or a population or anything
im really uninformed
im afraid i dont have the statistics in front of me
uh-huh
its not a tiny area
if i was looking at a $unc$u $unc$s map i would say it sort of reminds me of a
its not as big as $unc$california proportionately
uh-huh
uh-huh
but its more significant in the sense of its a great agricultural region
i see
i didnt really know that
i know a lot of their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right
yeah
and what about astonia
are they
theyre completely out now
right
i thought they were
yes
the $unc$three baltic republics got out as quickly as they could
but the $unc$ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture
right
its very important for the economics of the $unc$soviet $unc$union
so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could
right
except they cant fight
no
they dont
its done democratically
and $unc$bush has already given his opinion on it right
yes
didnt i read that
yes
so not that may matter
i dont know anymore
i fear for the $unc$russians from what i read
i wonder how theyre going to get through the winter food wise or any wise
sounds to me like theyll start rioting soon not that that would do any good
but i guess people do that when theyre desperate
thats true hasnt happened here for a while
but it
thats true
since the $unc$depression
i guess when the veterans went to $unc$washington
uh-huh
and the war riots of course
lets just hope we dont get to that point
things are not so good in $unc$texas job wise
no
i hear you have some problems
we do
we have lots and lots of layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs
and its pretty scary
do you blame the government in $unc$washington for this
i dont understand economics that well
i dont know
i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we dont
yeah
and so i assume that that has a great effect
yeah
uh-huh
and they said during the way reagan-bush years the rich got richer
the poor got poorer
the statistics prove that
so i guess
then you think its $unc$reagan and $unc$bush have done this
or is it just coincidence it was during this period
i really dont know
i think maybe they contributed to it
maybe they should pay more attention to the more equalization of the trade
uh-huh
of course if somebody in $unc$china can make something for $unc$ten cents and we have to make it for $unc$ten dollars because we have unions i dont know whats going to happen then
the $unc$chinese use slave labor too
right
thats $unc$one of the ways they get away with it
and child labor
yeah
right
i dont know
what do you think has caused our horrible situation
i dont think theres any $unc$one simple answer to the whole thing
$unc$one thing
thats very complicated
right
they say too that having a democratic $unc$congress and republican $unc$president is not good
ive read that is a theory
which $unc$one are we going to throw out
i hate to say it
but im tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
uh-huh
$unc$texas used to be a democratic state didnt it
i know
it used to
right
you dont want too many $unc$democrats anymore
and for a while i kind of deserted the party
but now its looking better to me
i like your governor
do you
im glad to hear that
shes an impressive woman
i think so too
i just admire her a lot
yeah
and i really hope she does well
but shes probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win
right
but look who she was running against
yeah
anybody could beat $unc$claytie in $unc$texas
he shot himself in the foot so many times
how did you get on this $unc$t $unc$i thing
i know some of the people
okay
go ahead
were going to compare notes
yeah
i often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
dont do it
i tell you i firmly believe in exercising
i think its a
i do it every day on a regular basis
i
what sort of regiment do you have
i just got back from biking $unc$twelve and a half miles
but this time of year you cant get much biking in
but every morning i use this presidents council of physical fitness
and its worth doing
and you can do it anywhere
i travel quite a bit in my business
yes
and you can do it wherever youre at
and if you do it
i do it every morning usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get dressed to go to work
yes
uh-huh
and what i do
ive done this for $unc$fifteen years
so you dont start at this kind of regiment
yes
i
so what im telling you isnt something you go out and do
and youll hurt yourself
every
it takes me about $unc$fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time
but i do $unc$twenty-five where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch left and right toe
uh-huh
and i do $unc$ten right and left trunk twisters
uh-huh
and i do about $unc$sixty leg thrust type things
uh-huh
and i do $unc$twenty leg lifters on each side when youre laying on the floor
yes
yes
right
and then i do $unc$fifty push-ups and do a $unc$hundred sit ups
and then i do about
my goodness
you do all of this in $unc$fifteen minutes
yeah
yeah
and then $unc$thirty
if you did football the old grass drills where youre on your stomach and you
uh-huh
prone type things where youre kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
and that takes maybe about $unc$thirteen minutes in the morning
yeah
what keeps you doing that
i sometimes start much more modest efforts
but i give up
i just find them boring
hard to find the time for it on a given day
and
years ago i used to referee football
yes
and to stay in condition i did that just as a normal basis
yes
and i tell you just by doing it
example this summer i was about $unc$fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be
so i increased
i do $unc$three $unc$hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning
i do a $unc$hundred then
and then i do about a $unc$hundred before supper and about a $unc$hundred before i go to bed
uh-huh
i lost $unc$fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
yes
and you can eat anything you want drink anything you want
but you dont
within reason you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
uh-huh
yep
and i just
youre ready to go at a
i think its really important
whenever i do it i feel good that i have done good because it seems right and good because it has good effects
good
but its this maintaining a regular habit that i just cant seem to do
thats why $unc$chuck i think if you did it on a daily basis and you didnt need elaborate things where you can make excuses like
yeah
i like biking
and during the summer ill do at least $unc$seventy-five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty
uh-huh
but you cant
uh-huh
theres excuses weather
yep
or you dont have time or something like that
but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth youre going to spend $unc$fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier
uh-huh
uh-huh
and once you start getting into that you just feel good
yes
and you look a whole lot better
yes
does your wife participate in any of this
or
unfortunately not
and theres no way i can get her to
uh-huh
its something you either just really want to do it
or you cant talk anyone into it
if you dont like to exercise it isnt going to happen
yes
yes
i sure wish she would
shes unfortunately overweight
but shes a wonderful woman
and no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
but you seemed to have solved that problem without any external help
no problem at all
and if you get $unc$one of these mats go to a store they normally have these exercise things these $unc$a $unc$b $unc$c of physical fitness on them
yeah
$unc$one of my kids got me $unc$one of those for $unc$christmas $unc$one year
and
whats this mat
its just an exercise mat that rolls up
so you can put it up just in the corner
is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it
yeah
you can do that
its that kind of like half inch of foam or something
but it doesnt
yeah
its a foam thing
yeah
yeah
yeah
and its just about $unc$six feet long rolls up
yeah
and i dont take it on trips with me
you could
but i dont mind
if i do sit ups ill throw a towel down or something
yeah
so you dont have the abrasive
okay
what do you think about the self insurance business
i watched something on t v a couple of months ago by $unc$ex $unc$surgeon $unc$general $unc$koop
uh-huh
and he talked about canadas system
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that
but the expensive stuff heart operations and things they have a managed scarcity
and they said that in $unc$canada there were as many heart trauma centers as there is in $unc$san $unc$francisco
so in $unc$one city in $unc$america theres as many hospitals that are equipped to do heart operations as in the entire area of $unc$canada
and thats kind of spooky
i understand what youre saying
and theres probably some truth to that
i think that generally i dont welcome added government responsibilities
however when anybody cant police their own profession it eventually leads to that
and i think the costs and the way the medical profession has every year
i being in my own business
in the last $unc$six years every year theres been at least minimum $unc$twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs
and i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter
uh-huh
i think theyre asking for it
i think the medical profession is just pushing until theres no option but the government take it over
and
do you think that its just medical guys
what about how expensive new equipment and technology is
thats where i think most of the cost is coming
i think a lot of it is
i dont disagree totally with that
but my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore up her knee
and it was ligaments in her knee as it turned out
uh-huh
she came back that
we were out at $unc$cape $unc$hatteras when this happened
and she got home
and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come
he knows knee problems okay
uh-huh
if anyone does this guy knows it
she goes in
he says i think this is what it is
but you better go to the hospital and have $unc$one of these m r i things
a $unc$thousand dollars for this magnetic resonance imaging type thing
and my wife said do i need that
and he says itll help me diagnose this
i suggest you go have this thing
insurance wont pick this up unless youre in the hospital
a $unc$thousand dollars for $unc$thirty-five minutes
great
doctors routinely send people in for anything
for years they didnt have this
and they solved these problems
and
yeah
i said to her look if you feel you got to go go
but i think a $unc$thousand dollars
these guys
i dont know what it is
but theres no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day
uh-huh
and even if they cost a $unc$hundred $unc$two $unc$hundred $unc$five $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollars at roughly a $unc$thousand dollars every half hour thats ridiculous
i dont care what anyone says
the costs are not
its a picture
it shouldnt cost more than $unc$thirty-five bucks for something like that reasonableness
but they arent reasonable
$unc$fifty a $unc$hundred dollars
they dont have to pay them back in $unc$three months time
no
yeah
ill have to agree with you there
but theres another problem
and thats how litigious our society is
if the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that hes going to be hauled into court
i think thats another problem
but thats part of our legalese problem
and that the government eventually will address too just because its out of control
i agree with you
i was on a jury
i didnt make the jury
but there was a deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant
uh-huh
it was $unc$three days after it was born
and he was the one that delivered it
and they got $unc$four attorneys
$unc$one guy out of $unc$houston he introduced himself as snake so-and-so
and he says anyone have trouble awarding $unc$five $unc$million dollars
and i says yeah
i got problems with
$unc$five $unc$million bucks isnt going to bring this kid back
as sorrowful as it is if the doctor is wrong he should be pulled from his license
but $unc$five $unc$million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it
it doesnt make logical sense to me
but
no
it doesnt
thats
you think about aids research
aids is a nasty terrible disease
and you die from it
so i think that they need to look into it
and its kind of like cancer
i dont
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer
uh-huh
i think itll probably be as difficult
how about yourself
im certainly in favor of aids research
and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does
i think that
because besides the fact that its a deadly disease that its a contagious disease so that its
although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
yeah
they say a $unc$million people are infected with the $unc$h $unc$i $unc$v virus
uh-huh
and yeah
i think
thats in the world or in $unc$america
you
in the country $unc$america
really
yeah
thats
and they have millions
whose figure is that
i dont know
ive just heard it on the radio
okay
sometimes you hear things on the radio that could be true or couldnt be
uh-huh
do you feel like this is
i guess theyre spending a $unc$billion or so a year on this aids research
uh-huh
do you think they should spend more
i think they should although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what theyre doing
and i dont necessarily think that they should fund aids research and in the process neglect cancer research or whatever
i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general
what do you think $unc$doug of $unc$mister $unc$johnson
i am sorry that he has the virus
$unc$magic
i dont know
i think its very strange that the media hasnt questioned him more strongly about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people
do you think hes the hero that hes being called by a bunch of the media
not really though i think hes probably doing the right thing for a man in his position
but i dont think its anything exceptional that hes doing
its what many people have done already who were just less famous
i took advantage of the opportunity when he came out
i talked to my kids about it
uh-huh
its something that i hadnt done before
uh-huh
thats good
im glad that $unc$mister johnsons changed his tune on safe sex to abstinence
i was glad he did that for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
uh-huh
uh-huh
lets see
what are some of the other questions
you dont
lets see
i dont have any friends that have the disease
i guess you might not
yeah
i do
my cousin does for instance
is it pretty nasty
and
yeah
yeah
it is
hes actually
he had aids related complex for a while
and he is now in full-blown aids really not doing very well and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing
yeah
it sounds awful
yeah
its a very nasty thing
is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly
and
yeah
thats basically it that the immune system can at first slow down
and the white blood cell count goes down
thats aids related complex
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom thats aids
and
and in that case people are prone to getting any kind of weird cancer that only animals got before
really
and
yeah
that sort of thing
okay
there we are
all right
tell me about the car that youve got
i have a $unc$honda hatchback $unc$nineteen $unc$eighty-four
uh-huh
and i had a hatchback a $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-eight version before this one
uh-huh
and ill be honest with you
i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and put together
and it does its job
all i have to do on my $unc$honda is change the oil and the filter every $unc$thirty-five $unc$hundred miles
and i did have to put $unc$two new front tires on at $unc$fifty $unc$thousand miles
but that car just purrs like the day it was built
i get $unc$forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and $unc$twenty-eight to $unc$thirty driving around in town
its a $unc$five speed straight stick machine
uh-huh
and i can carry more in that trunk area in my little $unc$honda than i can in the big cars
and i have a large $unc$pontiac
and i have a $unc$sixty-nine $unc$cougar which im saving because its old
but its in beautiful shape
uh-huh
but i can carry as much in my $unc$honda or more than i can in those other bigger cars
thats very interesting
ive had exactly the same experience with the one that ive got
and surprisingly its also an $unc$eighty-four
and
$unc$l $unc$x
yeah
im still here
what
it was an $unc$l $unc$x
yes
its an $unc$l $unc$x
its not a hatchback
but its
uh-huh
yours is a $unc$four door
$unc$four door
yeah
uh-huh
and very very comfortable car
big roomy trunk
yeah
and very happy with it
and i must admit its
if
my only consideration were buying another car just to tool around town in and make brief trips and things like that
i would very seriously consider buying $unc$one
i think theyre extraordinarily reliable cars
yes
they are
my real concern with why im not sure i want to buy a $unc$honda is because i have to make a kind of a steady trip down the road about once a month because im divorced
and i have a daughter that lives down in $unc$north $unc$carolina
uh-huh
and i drive down $unc$interstate $unc$ninety-five
and its just an absolutely wild highway
$unc$ninety-five is wild in any car
theres no doubt about that
yeah
and
because i run over to $unc$crystal $unc$city used to
im retiring the end of this month
uh-huh
but im very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there
and youve got it
so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine its very hard for me to imagine that a hondas going to be as safe a car as the one that ive got my eye on which is a $unc$volvo
uh-huh
uh-huh
in fact quite frankly ive owned a $unc$volvo in the past
and ive
uh-huh
theyre expensive cars to keep up when they need service
but ive found that ive had a lot of luck with them
course im a mechanically inclined kind of person
and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that need to be taken care of and so forth
and i guess thats $unc$one thing that recommends the $unc$honda to a lot of people is theres just very little that you have to do under the hood
and
yes
it just sits there and purrs
and all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter
i get $unc$six $unc$hundred miles on a tank of gas
i know
its really amazing
yeah
its
beautiful beautiful machine
absolutely
incredible
yeah
ive been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth
and i think that its very surprising some of these very expensive $unc$volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if youre willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own
is that right
uh-huh
uh-huh
and
a brand new $unc$volvo costs what $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars
certainly some of the top end ones
you can still get even the low end wagons for less than $unc$twenty $unc$thousand dollars
uh-huh
and we get
in the $unc$washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of $unc$volvo dealerships down here
uh-huh
so therere lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week
and i sort of scan the paper and look at them and so forth
and thats the other thing is that ive never really been too terribly much of a new car person
yeah
i think ive bought $unc$one or $unc$two new cars in my life
and ive tended to buy cars that are $unc$two or $unc$three and sometimes even $unc$four and $unc$five or $unc$six years old
this $unc$honda that i have i bought used
and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it
ive just rolled $unc$seventy $unc$thousand miles
and its an $unc$eighty-four
so
my $unc$eighty-four just has $unc$seventy-seven on it
yeah
and ive made many trips to $unc$washington and down to $unc$virginia $unc$beach $unc$virginia where my mother lives and things like that
and i drive it
about the weather
yes
very appropriate i guess
you ready for this
yeah
okay $unc$john
just a moment
guess what
we get to talk about the weather
the weather this time of year has actually been kind of unusual
i havent expected it to be colder until
like weve gotten the last couple of days
uh-huh
i dont know
i fly for a living
and ive
the weathers been terribly unusual every where ive been
you do
yeah
so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather
yeah
i imagine its kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather
it was around here last night
ill tell you that
ive heard on the news that we will be setting a record here in the $unc$state of $unc$texas for the large amounts of rain and moisture weve had this year that its going to break all kind of records that were set back since $unc$nineteen $unc$thirty-two
no kidding
so yeah
if it keeps on raining like this
and i understand its supposed to rain until $unc$saturday night
$unc$saturday or $unc$sunday they were saying
yeah
yes
yeah
i know the systems have been real strong out
i went through $unc$phoenix twice on $unc$wednesday morning
uh-huh
and approaches to low minimum both times
wow
and $unc$phoenix never gets that kind of weather
so
and so are you an airline pilot
yes
i am
great
for $unc$southwest
yeah
for $unc$southwest
fantastic
i have a brother thats a pilot also with $unc$american
is that right
yeah
i imagine with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you
i wouldnt call it danger
this really isnt bad stuff to fly around in
this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime
i guess so
yeah
yeah
the air systems are reasonably calm
the turbulence have a little bit of chop
uh-huh
but its not like it is in the spring time
yes
we moved down here from another location
and its spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
spectacular is the right word for them
pardon me
spectacular is a good word for them
ive never seen a thunder show like ive seen down here before in $unc$texas
its amazing
lights up the whole sky and even on a
ive seen it where theres not a cloud in the sky
its a cloudless night
and the rain isnt falling
but you can see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show
yeah
yeah
yeah
its fabulous
cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here
yeah
thats true
where are you from originally
im from northern $unc$utah
and thats a very arid climate from $unc$salt $unc$lake $unc$city area
uh-huh
and theres always a lot of snow
in fact where i grew up we were about an hours drive from $unc$seven to $unc$twelve different major ski resorts
and so there was an awful lot of snow
oh
and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything else
yeah
yeah
so we had a great time
were you near the $unc$park $unc$cities area
yeah
in $unc$snowbird and $unc$solitude and $unc$brighton and all those areas
beautiful area
uh-huh
i imagine have you skied before
weve skied
i have not skied that area
uh-huh
ive driven through it several times
we skied $unc$california a bunch when we lived out there
and of course we grew up in $unc$minnesota
uh-huh
and we do lot of cross country skiing there
yeah
yeah
great
do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year
not really
i
minnesotas gotten just hammered with snow
weve gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i think
yes
yeah
and ive been surprised that we havent seen more of the temperatures that weve got today that moved in last night
yeah
its been cold
there was a time though in the middle part of $unc$november that got really cool really really unseasonably cool
yes
yes
it did
and then it warmed right back up
and i thought great
yeah
and thats a fun th-
yeah
my wife was just listening here
and she said yeah
it froze in fact
yeah
it was real cold
yeah
but that was very unseasonable for us down here
but ive really enjoyed the weather down here too
because $unc$two years ago we were the day after $unc$christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather
and its not as severe i should say as the weather that ive experienced up in northern $unc$utah
yeah
yeah
thats real true
same with us from $unc$minnesota
its
in fact ive played golf on $unc$new years $unc$day $unc$one year
down here
yeah
yeah
not in $unc$minnesota
no
no
no
no
i have a brother-in-law that lives in $unc$minnesota
and they say boy $unc$six months out of the year its bitter cold and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
it is
it is
and theyve had
usually in $unc$minnesota they get their snow in $unc$january and $unc$february
uh-huh
and theyre up over $unc$sixty-five or $unc$sixty-
okay
i guess tonights subject is woodworking
what kind of woodworking do you do
do you
kind of mainly the woodworking ive done lately is made for example a little nativity scene not the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and some odd stuff around the house
uh-huh
and so i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking
and i do it out of hobby more than something i have to do
how about yourself
i like to think of it as a hobby but i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
a few years ago they needed some book shelves
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
and it actually worked pretty well
and over the years ive refined those plans
i got myself a router
and im very good at making book shelves
uh-huh
its also a way of relieving stress
my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed out i just go out in the garage and weve got more book shelves
ill have to come and see them
that sounds like a good idea
i
and that is right
it is out of necessity
because lot of the things we cant be able to afford
but also i sometimes think that i enjoy doing that
and i like to get out and to work with my hands
and sounds like you got some real nice tools too
do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools
yeah
little by little i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things
uh-huh
gotten a good belt sander
and the router helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
uh-huh
the latest project that ive been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a cabinet to put a t v in
a entertainment type center
right
oh
and it works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have
so i designed a space just the right size for the t v and then the v c r and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment
right
right
right
and thats worked pretty well
with the router you can make nice
i guess dado joints is what its called
right
yes
i
yeah
im aware of that
and its
and also with a router you can make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and casings and so forth that are real nice
thats right
thats right
so thats good
thats good
but what i need next is a good table saw
yeah
and i debate whether its better to get just a straight table saw or to get $unc$one of these rotary arm saws
radial arm saw is i guess what theyre called
uh-huh
it seems to me the radial arm saw is better
it takes up less room
yeah
you set the wood down
and you move the saw
yeah
whereas if youre ripping wood youre probably better off with a table saw
and with a radial arm saw if you do have a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldnt be able to do that
but yeah
a table saw does take a lot of space and is a pretty big investment
yeah
and
thats partly my problem now
i dont have room for this
i
where we lived before up north basements were common
uh-huh
and i used to put all the stuff in my basement
but not so here in $unc$texas
uh-huh
no
they dont have basements
im from up north also
and no
theres no basements down here
and its kind of hard to get shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that
yeah
yeah
lot of the equipment too that ive used in the past ive used in school
and i would
i dont know
id kind of like to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make some pretty nice pieces of wood for different things for tables for chairs for decks and so forth
so i dont know
uh-huh
i just enjoy woodworking
and i think the main thing is like you say its a good out
its an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day
and its a great stress reliever
have you ever used a lathe
yes
in school i have
and ive made different things tables for chairs
and ive made bowls
and
did you hear our topic
its in regards to discussing homes
homes
yes sir
uh-huh
are you settled in a place
yeah
im settled in a place
ive been in it for $unc$thirteen years since $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-eight
and its in $unc$richardson $unc$texas which is north $unc$dallas
right
uh-huh
and weve lived in $unc$two houses in $unc$richardson
we moved here in $unc$seventy-four and changed locations in $unc$seventy-eight
okay
how about yourself
we left here in $unc$seventy-six
we were here for a few years
then we have come back just this summer
right now were looking for housing somewhere down in the $unc$duncanville and $unc$cedar $unc$hill area
are you familiar with that
yeah
its a nice area
yeah
it is
the kids are in school here in $unc$duncanville
were in a temporary place right now
so theyve enjoyed the school
so were kind of trying to stay here
but
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want
or
the problem we got is that weve got $unc$five children
boy
and so we really want $unc$four or $unc$five bedroom house
and everybody says how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing
right
so we look at the paper
we talk to our realtor
and you can cut the listings in about a third when you go from $unc$three to $unc$four bedrooms or $unc$five
sure
are you looking
or you settled
no
were settled
and were
having
im probably older than you
im $unc$fifty-two
but my youngest is getting married this year graduating college
great
so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in i guess
gosh
were looking forward to retiring in about $unc$three years and maybe relocating to $unc$florida or somewhere closer to our families
great
okay
okay
are you from $unc$florida originally
no
from $unc$west $unc$virginia
but my wifes parents are from the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$new $unc$jersey area
yeah
but everyone has seem to relocated down that area
yeah
seems like a nice place to go
yeah
yeah
weve got $unc$five
and the oldest is ninth grade
and the youngest is second grade
and i think theyre going to be with us forever
i dont know if thats true
but its sure were not anywhere near looking to cut down in size
were trying to find
i understand
you need very minimum $unc$four and probably $unc$five
yeah
in fact $unc$six would be real good
right
my wife and i can share a bedroom
its tough to find a $unc$five and $unc$six bedroom house isnt it
either
i dont think its possible unless you multimillionaire something like that
i know
seems like you get in that category youre in the $unc$three $unc$hundred $unc$thousand dollar homes or whatever
and thats an awful lot
yeah
yeah
it is
yeah
were having
if we find something for id say less than a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty $unc$thousand well be doing all right
right
thats
but i think the things out there
its just a matter of finding the right place
just matter of looking
right
lot of people in your situation will buy a $unc$four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something
i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school
and there were $unc$seven kids in her family
wow
and they converted the dining room and did this and that
but they always seemed to get along fine
yeah
yeah
i think once we get into a place it will be just fine
but until then its a little stressful just looking all the time and that sort of thing
sure
i know
and theres nothing harder than that
i always just sort of assign my wife that chore
then i would let her narrow it down to $unc$three or $unc$four
then id go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do
yeah
maybe thats the case
at least shes got more opinions
seems like theres more constraints more things that she thinks about openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore
yes
why certainly
i understand that
what kind of business are you in
im in the sporting goods business
im a manufacturers rep
i represent $unc$fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies
yeah
great
who are you with
were with an organization called $unc$wycliff $unc$bible $unc$translators
uh-huh
its a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing
great
its got an office down here near $unc$duncanville
and we just moved down to be on staff down here
so
how was the
you say you lived in the $unc$denver area before
right
how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices
we were really surprised to find that theyre higher here
no kidding
when we moved from $unc$louisiana to $unc$denver it was astounding to find that prices were i guess almost $unc$two or $unc$three times as high as wed expected
and then to come down here we thought things would be lower
and theyre not
i guess really prices for housing are just
okay
wonderful touch tone telephone there
what kind of books do you enjoy reading
i have a wide variety of hobbies
therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide
i get a charge out of $unc$texas highway which is very colorful and not being a native of $unc$texas but being here $unc$eleven years have a tendency to find out about the different areas of the state by reading it
oh
right
ive read that one too
i only had a subscription once
but my mother always gave me hers
and i really enjoyed all the little things that you find out about $unc$texas
yeah
absolutely its great the way that its broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things
its pretty neat
i like photography magazines
i dont take a subscription or anything like that
things
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
and kind of strange because its not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house
uh-huh
and then ill sit up and read just to refresh to keep active on it
but
uh-huh
how about yourself
i have an interest in art
so i frequently purchase and read books mainly on water color because thats my big interest at the moment
thats great
and i guess i like a variety of things lots of fiction type books
right now im occasionally reading on a book about the $unc$mardi $unc$gras in $unc$new $unc$orleans and its history
uh-huh
thats fairly interesting
i bet that would be rather interesting
thats self improvement
thats kind of a hobby
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing
yeah
i dont know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement
how about you
i hate to
yes
i do
we have these classes we attend management classes
and they give you books
and the last book matter of fact i read was at americas service by $unc$carl $unc$albrecht
it talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the $unc$t $unc$i culture here at $unc$texas $unc$instruments
yeah
$unc$one of its great slogans is if youre not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
uh-huh
so thats all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer
youre my customer im your customer sort of thing
right
every now and then im loaned a tape i can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of $unc$pat $unc$hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type which all betters yourself
yeah
yeah
yeah
maybe i am into some things occasionally that i dont think of in terms of self improvement
uh-huh
they are
but i dont label it as such
like what for example
i dont know
i have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things
but they would be things on how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself getting yourself in gear to sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do convincing you that you need to get on with it
sure
sure
how about items like the $unc$one minute manager which used to be a big
okay
yes
so those are self improvements
sure
our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know by a man named $unc$doctor $unc$bittel $unc$b $unc$i $unc$t $unc$t $unc$e $unc$l
and its a very laymans approach towards managing different types of people
and the very last chapter and i havent figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers
so its interesting
here again its casual reading
and its not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff
and its really excellent fast reading
but as you say sometimes its difficult to know if its
i think if somebody would say hey read these $unc$ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them
yeah
yeah
if he casually just walked into it and put down a $unc$stephen $unc$king book and i picked up $unc$one of them i might be a little more interested
i dont know
im not sure i could take too much of $unc$stephen $unc$king
thats a little heavy for me
yeah
theyre hard to set down because its so interesting
and of course theyre all just a little spookier than the movies
but theyre always challenging to get through $unc$one of them
yeah
i have a hard time finishing books
i guess i also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement and that type of thing because thats what im involved in a lot at work
uh-huh
in quality especially now days thats almost everything that comes across the airways
yeah
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
but i think sometimes the word is a little over used
exactly right
but
yeah i think we name drop it a little too much and dont fully understand what it is were saying
i think its just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
and all that kind of rolls in together there
yeah
but thats just kind of part of it
okay
any other comments
not that i can think of
i think im under my quota a little bit
i need to probably make a phone call or $unc$two
we just started
right
this is true
ive enjoyed it
you too
and good-bye
have a good day
good-bye
bye-bye
okay
i dont know about you
but where i am we have an extremely lax dress policy at work
and it varies every day from jeans $unc$one day to business suits the next
its pretty bad
but its true
they tend to try to be real lax
and supposedly the policy is we hire these wonderful creative people
and we dont want to smush their creativity
we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want
and you really will see people in jeans $unc$one day and business suits the next
im kind of that way too
i work in the legal department
and where we are now what were doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
yeah
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day
it always seems like im doing that
and i cant see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry boxes of documents around
so if im just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down
but if were going to have a meeting where were having the attorneys come in or other partys attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up
yeah
and ill wear a dress and hose and stuff
yeah
were kind of that way too
i try to
im the same way you are
i kind of try to judge from day to day
i know where i am we work a lot with the customers
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
and if i know that theyre going to be there i try to really watch it and like you say really dress up
uh-huh
and if i know theyre not
ive been doing a lot of reorganization the last couple of months the same way you are
uh-huh
and its just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress
thats right
thats right
it is
and so
as a matter of fact i thought i had $unc$one funny story
when i was at $unc$t $unc$i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through $unc$two $unc$thousand boxes
we had them in the warehouse
and at that point the warehouse was over across the road
and it wasnt air conditioned
and we were there like in the middle of the summer
its unair-conditioned
it was dusty and dirty
there was a fan at the very end of the row
and that was it
and so we didnt really know we werent supposed to
we thought $unc$t $unc$i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
uh-huh
we wore shorts
we didnt know that was a big no no
no
and the supervisor from another area came up to us
and this area where record retention is theres only a few people that work there
and he knew who worked there
he should have realized that we werent regulars in the warehouse there
and he came up to us
and he just said whos your supervisor
he called our supervisor and our supervisors supervisor
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts
no
he didnt at least say to us did you know youre not supposed to do that
that could have alleviated a big problem
we ended up getting called out on it
how awful
it sounds like $unc$mister $unc$power $unc$hungry
yeah
just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spine out here at $unc$lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
uh-huh
and i dont care
you can call them split skirts
and you can call them culottes all you want
but these were shorts
thats all they were
i dont care what else you call them
if theyre below the knee okay
maybe you can call them split skirts
if theyre above the knee they turn into shorts
and these werent even really full ones
they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were the real wide full ones
and these werent even those
these were pretty short black
and they were very dressy
the were black velvet shorts
and she had on black hose and black heels
and she looked very very nice
but you dont wear shorts to work
$unc$as far as im considered she was in violation
and nobody says anything to them
its always been a big problem in $unc$lewisville in the summertime
if they just
the management doesnt ever seem to want to cut off that no
this is wear were going to draw the line
this is shorts
yeah
and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going god we have a pair of those at home too
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear
but
ive seen some people try to just come in over the weekend because they want to use the $unc$texteller machine
yeah
and they have said no
yeah
and then during the week you see these women in the
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesnt make them not shorts anymore
yeah
ive never seen them do it without hose
they always have hose on
but still theyre shorts
i dont care what you say
theyre shorts
i think $unc$t is dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway
i didnt know that $unc$e $unc$d $unc$s has a very strict dress code
i had a friend
do they really
definitely
i had a friend who worked there for a year or so
and they spell it out
for men its particular suits the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes
my $unc$god
it is definitely lined out
women are not allowed to wear slacks
you wear coordinated suits
i couldnt afford to work there
and a particular kind of shoe high heel
it is spelled out
no
when i was looking at her materials when she first started she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
and it told about the dress code
and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way
$unc$t $unc$i says no shorts and no halters
i know thats it
yeah
and $unc$e $unc$d $unc$s is very particular about this hair cuts
wow
it was like you cant have such and such facial hair no beards and just really detailed
i dont know that that would be a good environment to work in
i see
i am more
i dont know about anybody else
and a lot of bosses may say im nuts
but i am more productive when im in pants
i am
i work faster
i get things done faster than when im in a dress and heels
i
and its weird
but i can get so much more done if im dressed comfortable
the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had another person coming from $unc$washington our outside counsel
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
but she really didnt get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
right
and she came with skirts just like shed be going into the office
yeah
and wed try to say didnt you bring any pants or anything
were out here in the warehouse
you got your skid of that wooden pallet of boxes
uh-huh
and youre going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the boxes and then repack your skid
she was so hot and miserable in the skirt
you cant do that in a skirt poor soul
yuck
she finally tried to go buy a pair of pants
but it was just completely miserable for her
yeah
thats terrible
thats terrible
gosh
i dont know
i just figure yeah
sometimes i worry about if i go in in pants
and i never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans
but ill go in in pants
today i had on a pair of navy blue dress slacks and like a peach colored top and not cruddy but not a dress either
and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that will hold you back if you dont dress in your dress for success business suits everyday if upper management doesnt notice that and remember that later on
but i dont know if they do or not
i see a lot of the managers
and theyre in jeans
so
some of our people in the legal department
we have assistants to the general counsel
and its funny
because theres $unc$one that always wears a suit
a matter of fact hes never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
really wow
and then theres another one whos a little younger and a little more yuppish
and hes always kind of in the khaki pants and a shirt
uh-huh
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
yeah
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt
so thats just
isnt that funny
with the little suspenders or something on
so weve kind of had a variety there
thats great
but i think a lot of times its mainly who theyre going to meet with
or theyre meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then thats how they are
yeah
if theyre just going to be meeting with $unc$t $unc$i like to talk about a patent kind of thing and theyre engineers that theyre talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
and theyre usually casual
thats the smart way to do it
yeah
it really is because your making
when theyre meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in a $unc$six $unc$hundred dollar $unc$three piece suit its going to make the people theyre meeting with feel very uncomfortable
or it would me
its $unc$one of those slippery attorneys coming in here
yeah
yeah
look at this slick guy
i wonder what kind of money does he make
uh-huh
i can see it now
it was good to talk to you
it was really enjoyable
yeah
this is kind of a fun project
it really is
ive done some of the other speech programs
but weve never got to talk to another person
it was always just talking to the computer
yuck
yeah
so this is a little different
its kind of enjoyable
im really looking forward to it
yeah
thanks a lot
okay
bye
bye-bye
okay
the question was what is your opinion of youth spending a year or $unc$two in public service
i think it would be a great idea
im not sure about requiring it of people because people are going feeling resentful
i dont know
but i think it would be a great idea
yeah
seems like theres so many kids that dont have any since of what they want to be or do
or they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time
and all countries sure need help
so
huh-uh
would you be more in favor of a local
my only experience with it i was in $unc$central $unc$america for a while and in $unc$san $unc$salvador in $unc$el $unc$salvador
huh-uh
huh-uh
for instance everybody had what they called there social year that they had to put in
really
and basically it was a repayment for high school education
huh-uh
and most of them joined the $unc$red $unc$cross
and it was done internally
i just
there was very little external
i think possibly what theyre thinking about here more external $unc$peace $unc$corps type things where were sending people off shore
yeah
i think that would be real interesting for people to do
but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them to other countries
huh-uh
but i dont know
if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldnt be able to really send children to do that
yeah
i didnt know
i dont know how the $unc$peace $unc$corps works
i guess i was of age when the $unc$peace $unc$corps came in and all that
yeah
i was too
i thought seriously about joining at that time
i thought it was a fantastic idea
did you ever get any information on it
i sent off for stuff on it
but i dont remember that much about it
i know that they trained you in the language
and
thats what i was wondering about was whether they actually
you actually got paid too while in the $unc$peace $unc$corps
it wasnt much
yeah
but i guess you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses and
wasnt $unc$jimmy carters mama that was in the $unc$peace $unc$corps
yeah
i think so
yeah
yeah
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values like $unc$saudi $unc$arabia where they couldnt drink
where they couldnt do that
yeah
you might end up with a revolution
i dont know which end though
really
yeah
yeah
thats been interesting though the kids that have been over coming back right now
yeah
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey thats not a bad way to do it
because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime is punishable just almost instantly and public
public hanging
yeah
public hanging and this sort of thing
so you dont have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes
yeah
yeah
ive heard that in $unc$china and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody youd be murdered on the street
so
yeah
i guess thats the price of freedom i guess is a little
the public service thing again
i guess in my own having had the whole $unc$three or $unc$four minutes to give it a great deal of thought i think i agree with you $unc$one $unc$hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary
but when you do that then it becomes almost a
or it can be
yeah
there have
people will kind of set up their own little club
yeah
thats true
but if
people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that
yeah
might not go if it was voluntary
but i dont know how theyd enforce it
if it was
yeah
if they went awol what are you going to do
yeah
shoot them
put them in jail
i dont know
send them over to $unc$iraq
yeah
right
have a vacation in $unc$iraq for a year
i know my dad always talked about
he was in $unc$c $unc$c $unc$c during
yeah
and he was a rock rib $unc$iowa type $unc$republican
and the only good thing he could ever say about the whole $unc$roosevelt administration was civilian conservation corps
huh-uh
because he was in it
he thought that was great
yeah
the rest of it was all hog wash
but that was great
it seems like it would develop pride in people if its in their own country
it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way
i
it would take quite a few people
i think it might build jobs for people that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too
yeah
i dont know
yeah
the only
to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
that brings up the interesting subject too
who would determine what these people do
yeah
yeah
if its run by the individual state
$unc$c $unc$c $unc$c was run by the $unc$army
and in effect
huh-uh
and the only opposition to it really was that it was starting some sort of a military elitist type special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing
huh-uh
and when the politics get real confusing
yeah
really there could be some scandals involved if it wasnt people that were really fair and in a legal way or something
yeah
they could send all the people over to $unc$one particular part of town or $unc$one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to get supported
or
yeah
weve gotten to the point where if the racial make up of the group was such and such theyd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and that kind of thing
yeah
that could be a complicated too couldnt it
yeah
yeah
suppose they had a group who were construction oriented
and they went and they built cant think of a good example a swimming pool or anything
and you can only build it in $unc$one place
and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream you didnt build one over here
yeah
thats true
unfair or something
yeah
yeah
i think
boy
its $unc$one of those things on the surface it seems like a great idea
its like a joke i heard once about elephant foot soup
its easy to do once you find a elephant foot
its the logistics of the thing that gets you going
yeah
really
yeah
it seems like theres a lot
you dont hear much on the news about young people really wanting to do anything good or anything like that
but im sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing
i saw on the news the other night that the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the $unc$cosby show $unc$kisha $unc$knight $unc$pullman was starting a
i guess now shes practically a teenager
yeah
she started some type of national organization for youth to volunteer to tutor other kids to read and do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards helpful things
and i know everyone in the high schools in $unc$dallas
theres a couple high schools that have wanted to start a minority
i think it was in a hispanic area
they wanted to start a club for the teenagers instead of they said all these gangs kids could join to belong
huh-uh
but they didnt have anything positive the kids could be doing helping
yeah
so they were trying to start that out
so if theres kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them if their willing to do it
yeah
yeah
its just the
here you are to the logistics of the thing again
yeah
whos going to run it
what
how
its just so many
yeah
like i said at the beginning ive got so many connections with people in $unc$central $unc$america
my daughter-in-law is panamanian
huh-uh
and they have situations like that down there where they have the social in some sort of way
huh-uh
if you want to go to school outside the country and many $unc$salvadorians did theyd go to school in $unc$cornell $unc$iowa of all places
huh-uh
and when they came back theyd have to serve this year
and it turned out to be kind of a joke
the ones i knew always chose the $unc$red $unc$cross because they didnt do anything
i see
and they had all kinds of things they could go into agricultural and really good stuff
yeah
but unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that $unc$red $unc$cross it was so many of them in it that your chance of having to do something it was very slim
yeah
yeah
and so
we belong to the $unc$church of $unc$jesus $unc$christ of $unc$latter $unc$day $unc$saints which is the mormon church
huh-uh
huh-uh
and there is men and also women
women arent nearly as frequent
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission
and theyre all over the world
and its incredible logistics
they have a training center where they teach them
its called the $unc$missionary $unc$training $unc$center in $unc$utah
and they have to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things
yeah
and then they go and actually live in that country for the
young men do it for $unc$two years and the young women for $unc$eighteen months
okay
then thats kind of a private organization
right
im familiar with
my instructor pilot was a $unc$mormon
he was a good instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible
yeah
he had a direct connection somewhere
yeah
right
he felt that he really had an in
so things he would do with an airplane
yeah
but any rate thats off the subject
yeah
but i
they dont get paid for it
but there is funding that comes
theyre supposedly saving up on their own
and the church helps them out some
huh-uh
but you know that it is incredible
i see how they were organized in $unc$central and $unc$south $unc$america
yeah
and its
yeah
okay
ill let you start first okay
okay
im presently living in a house
first time
we had the house built
and so this is our fifth year in it i guess
and it was a real excitement to go out and select the house and have $unc$one made and built
and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of $unc$three $unc$hundred and $unc$forty houses
and as we did with probably $unc$ninety-five percent of the people here in dallas-fort $unc$worth we bought a $unc$fox and $unc$jacobs home
and theyre good for about $unc$five years or $unc$four years
and after that they start falling apart
so i would not recommend $unc$f and $unc$j house for my dog to live in because theyre overpriced
but theyre a cheap house
if you cant afford something good
theyre good for that
and you can call it a home because its a place to go home and keep the rain off your head
but as far as the costs for what your getting the longevity of the house is not worth it
how about in your case
in my case my husband is not a carpenter
but in fact hes in electronics
but he knew the only way wed ever have a new home is if he would build it
so it took him about $unc$two and a half years
but he built us a house
its
we have $unc$thirty-two $unc$hundred square feet
and its a brick house
and price-wise it was great because he did it all himself
so that way we could kind of control it
uh-huh
and we live in kind of a small town
uh-huh
and its nothing fancy
its a house
its nice
and its real pretty
and were all comfortable in it
thats great
thats great
thats
ive heard
i have another gentleman friend of mine who had a house built
as a matter of fact another guy is building $unc$one now
hes been doing it for $unc$three years
and the citys a little upset with him
but i understand you save a lot of money off by doing that
and
you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else
nothing wrong with that
you know
ill vouch for that
but of course my husband did everything except
my brothers a trim carpenter
and he came in and did the inside for us
and that helped
that was a big savings
and
yes
and we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing
thats great
have you been in it long
really
have you any plans to maybe expand or move onward
no
were
our kids are kind of still small now
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we dont need such a large house that well sell it
but he will not build a second one himself because he says age-wise hell never be able to handle that again
i see
first one is always a bear
yes
yes
were having an architect friend of mine design a house for us
and that can basically be put in any state any kin-
so thats kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted
oh
uh-huh
and hes charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
and hes certified and registered
so least we know its not going to fall in or something if its built
yeah
oh
but i have heard that your approach is right
you can actually go out and sub it even if you dont want to get hands on
uh-huh
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things
and thats kind of the plan i have
so im
yeah
everyone i talk to i file in my little book and do other things with it
thats great
thats great
but like i said otherwise the expense
but we could not have one as large as we have if we hadnt did it ourselves
sure
i can imagine
yeah
its not an $unc$eldorado house or anything like that
but its ours
if your happy with it thats all that counts
thats right
thats right
thats all
you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else
apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
thats an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell i guess
isnt it
it really is
because im always shocked at what they have it appraised at
i think oh my goodness
thats great
yeah
i guess that about does it
okay
and it was nice talking to you
nice talking with you too
okay
bye-bye
bye
okay
i think were supposed to discuss our view of the $unc$soviet $unc$union as a continuing threat to the $unc$united $unc$states
okay
how do you feel about that
i dont really
i more
i dont know about the government as much as
the people i wouldnt consider to be a threat at all
and i really dont feel much the $unc$soviet $unc$union itself is a threat anymore
im worried about them
theyre in a very tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that theyre attempting to go through
im concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden
theyre very large
yeah
and they can become very quickly a large financial burden as $unc$one more stepchild we have to carry around
yeah
i think thats a real important aspect
and that as the mo-
lets see the more that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a reality
i know that this last winter was very hard on several areas in the $unc$ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of $unc$siberia
the people there have money
thats not their problem
but theres no food for them to buy
and its
you cant eat money
and they have a problem their whole attitude
im not sure which crop it was
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldnt get anyone to harvest it
yeah
and the people in the city were saying why should i go do that make the government do that thats not my job
right
theyve got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what theyve been through now
and theyve been under the oppression that theyve been under for so long that now they have some freedoms
but they dont know how to act yet
they dont understand that to make that work
theyve got to take some responsibility for themselves
its not just the governments responsibility anymore
you cant just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well
absolutely
and i think that theyre having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back
people only go forward
and i think that that is giving them
im expecting a call
and unfortunately i think its come through
ive enjoyed talking to you
okay
thank you
bye
all right
bye-bye
real problem the last few days $unc$one of their young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season
it was a catcher
uh-huh
and they really dont have an excess of catchers
and its really kind of late to be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the $unc$rangers have
yeah
theyre not the highest paying ball team around
no
no
theyre not are they
but i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys ill tell you
goodness
i would too
even the bench warmer i would
yeah
thats right
i really havent been an active $unc$ranger fan in several years
i used to go take my son
when he was in high school he enjoyed going to baseball games
uh-huh
ill have to admit i kind of went more to see the other team a lot of times than i did the $unc$rangers
yeah
but i think theyre doing better
i do to
i have boys $unc$eight and $unc$eleven
and we go quite often to watch the $unc$rangers
yeah
i can imagine
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid
uh-huh
oh yes
were heavy into that too
i think its more fun to play than it is to watch
i do too
yeah
and i think what caught so many of our attentions last year was that $unc$nolan $unc$ryan
yes
of course
of course
as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning
he just pitched his first exhibition game a day or so ago
uh-huh
and he pitched $unc$five full innings
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to start out that strong
yeah
yes
uh-huh
no big deal
its just part of a days work
yeah
i know it
yeah
yeah
hes something else
he really is
he really is an
as far as predictions and stuff i really think the $unc$rangers may come out real strong this year
they could do very well
they sure could
they coul- because
i dont know
but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
i really do
yeah
theyve got i guess all
all their players are signed now
some of them are not too happy about it
but theres no hold outs
yeah
yeah
at least that should help
that should help
it sure should
yeah
it should uh-huh
but in a way i really do
and of course theres a few more i think are good ball teams also
oh yeah
sure
like $unc$oakland as and the $unc$giants
i really do
sure
sure
uh-huh
$unc$cincinnati
yeah
there sure are
i like to go watch the $unc$giants when they come to $unc$houston some times
uh-huh
uh-huh
thats right
but
ive never seen the $unc$astros play
you havent
huh-uh
i have a few times
uh-huh
theyre a good ball team
thats right
they really are
they sure are
wouldnt it be something to have a $unc$world $unc$series between the $unc$rangers and the $unc$astros
wouldnt it though
boy
i tell you that would draw a crowd wouldnt it
wouldnt it
it sure would
my goodness
we might actually get to go to a $unc$world $unc$series
thats right
wouldnt that be something
yeah
it sure would
thats something you dream about
absolutely
but there are a lot of $unc$ranger fans around
there sure is
and they really are
now $unc$incavalia i dont know how familiar you are with him
but last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump
yeah
but theyre saying this year their predictions is that hes really going to come out of it and be on top
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
boy
hes a bull isnt he
isnt he though
he really is gosh
he sure is
he either hits home run or strike out
uh-huh
thats right
there is not ever a in between for him
thats right
its kind of like $unc$babe $unc$ruth
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the $unc$rangers though
apparently i think his contract is up after the end of this year
and theyre not sure theyre going to be able to sign him again
to sign him again
yeah
yeah
that may or may not happen
yeah
you never know
thats right
its a long way away
thats sure ri-
if you offer them money im sure theyll do a little bit of everything
thats right
thats right
unfortunately the $unc$rangers dont spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do
no
no
no like that $unc$joe $unc$hosago
yeah
thats right
is there going to be a ticket increase this year price do you know
i hadnt heard
i havent either
i really havent
those $unc$cowboys have increased their prices again this year
oh yeah
but i didnt know
i dont think ive heard anything on the $unc$rangers
or i dont remember it if i have
i hadnt either
yeah
we hadnt
like i said we
i dont even guess theyve even thought about sending the schedules out yet
yeah
i guess its too early
yeah
because we usually get one
we usually order our tickets way in advance
uh-huh
its a good idea
yeah
we try to go so often
uh-huh
yeah
if you have young children they get a kick out of it
they do
uh-huh
ive enjoyed talking to you
you too $unc$lori
and hopefully well get to talk again
right
you take care
okay
bye-bye
okay
bye-bye
okay
what is
do you have a favorite recipe
yeah
thats what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe
it says what you would have for a dinner party
this is strange because i pressed $unc$one and i thought it said begin
oh
okay
maybe were all set
okay
well talk for $unc$five minutes
they interrupt at the end
yeah
it says what you would have for a dinner party
i just happen to plan one out for $unc$saturday
ill tell you what im going to have if i can find it
thats wonderful
okay
i have this new fondue pot
and i was going to do basic cheese fondue
and i have $unc$two different kinds of breads and some ham
and i was going to try something weird which
when you have fish $unc$au $unc$gratin
i was going to make some fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
i dont know if it will come out
thats
what kind of fondue the cheese dip or
yeah
the cheese fondue i make
some people like $unc$swiss
i prefer cheddar
and ill mix
i wont have a sharp cheddar because for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar
right
yeah
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins
that sounds good
see you dont necessarily have to dip this stuff
and i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable
thats always a good thing
vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk
i think they like to have healthy stuff too
its
yeah
its amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
definitely
i think better even than other kinds of food
yeah
instead of something greasy or
right
exactly
yeah
my girlfriends do catering
and always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray
i think they try and suggest it
uh-huh
what ive been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make food kabobs
you take little toothpicks and cut up pineapple and strawberry and even banana if you can do it just before you leave
oh
yes
right
it stays nice and fresh
right
thats true
or even have you ever seen where theyll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat
yeah
yeah
i like those
yep
they made a couple of those
they made one for my bridal shower
and i was pretty pleased
i never made one for myself though
but they look easy enough to make
its not
i think it would be a lot of work
because its
yeah
you have to cut each thing or use the melon baller and stuff
but i think theyre really neat
and i think theyre worth the time because they
yeah
you get probably pretty sticky after you get done
yeah
then youve got to drain the water out of the watermelon because when you scrape it it makes the water
right
yeah
yeah
something i do ill make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them
yeah
i have $unc$two nieces
and they go melt some chocolate chips
go buy me some strawberries
is that good
ive seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate
but ive never tried it
are they really good
yeah
if you get a sweet strawberry theyre much better
but if you get a sour strawberry
i bet it doesnt mix well does it
yeah
no
the strawberries are coming in season now from
theyre coming up from $unc$florida of course
i live in $unc$vermont
but theyre really reasonably priced
theyre coming up from $unc$florida
so
thats good
because i know theyve been really expensive lately because they werent in season
yeah
of course they had to be grown in greenhouses and stuff and in
yeah
actually i think they get some of them from $unc$south $unc$america
is that right
yep
they
a lot of a winter produce comes from $unc$south $unc$america
i
of course their seasons are switched
uh-huh
right
so do you want to discuss the recipe
i have a recipe if you want
okay
sure is that right
it filled
a lot of people try to stay away from this
but i make my own homemade pudding just because i dont like box pudding
ive never heard of that
yeah
and it if you
first of all i take about a quarter and a half of milk
and i put it in a $unc$two quart saucepan
and you put it on a really low heat
uh-huh
and you want to use $unc$one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it ends up burning
no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot
uh-huh
i dont let that worry me
and i get the milk lukewarm
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
and i have this thing
its called the slender blender
it makes a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough
its i dont know
theyre called moo goo leaves or something
theyre sl-
i think i know what youre talk-
is it a hand held
yeah
theyre real neat
the
yeah
okay
i think theyre real reasonably priced
some of them they used to be a $unc$hundred dollars
and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
but i didnt get that one
i got the $unc$black and $unc$decker kind
but its real handy because it doesnt have a cord
and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk
and it does an excellent job
or just hand beat it
i guess you could use a hand mixer
but i dont think it gets it good enough
uh-huh
and then before the milk gets too hot i add $unc$two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar
and i let it pretty much
i beat it every minute for about $unc$ten seconds
and it starts thickening
when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little i dont know
it gets little globs of this rubbery cornstarch
and you just keep beating it in
and its the
the trick is to have this blender
so if you were
youd have to probably almost go out
and someone whos just going to make it first time its
youll have much better luck if you had $unc$one of these little blenders
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
or after its thickened i cook it for a good
once it starts boiling i cook it for a good $unc$seven to $unc$ten minutes
uh-huh
and then you can make chocolate
or you can take it off and let it cool
you put really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
and that makes french vanilla custard
yeah
wow
that is really interesting
are you saying to use for chocolate unsweetened
a chocolate powder
unsweetened
yeah
that cocoa the unsweetened
it comes in like a real dark can
yeah
our mothers used to use it
and then
i have some
yeah
we all used to
i just want to
yeah
its the unsweetened kind
its not like $unc$nestles $unc$quik
right
okay
i suppose you could use that
i-
cooking chocolate
yeah
but
thats really interesting
ive never heard of anybody making their own pudding before thats really neat
i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell
and it was red
and im
this is kind of groedy
how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own
actually i found it in $unc$one of my mothers homemade cookbooks
something she had collected out of womans $unc$day or something
is that right
neat
that is just really neat
because i
i think you couldnt make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater
but
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good
yeah
but i still think a beater would do it good enough
the trick is to get the cornstarch
uh-huh
yeah
right in the lukewarm milk
sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
and i would put it in the sink
and ill take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good
it seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid
once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
so you put the milk in the cornstarch
yeah
and ill do this
sometimes ill put my after i pour that back into my saucepan
ill put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg
so
and then put that back in the saucepan
yep
and then if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
thats
because by the vanilla doesnt seem to thicken as well as the
sometimes the cocoa is
my husband really likes it thick
he says i can stick the spoon right in this
oh
because im always worrying it wont firm up because when you take it out of the saucepan its like boy i hope this thickens a little more because its not like real package thick
when you cook a package its a little less
uh-huh
but i put it in a nice glass bowl
and some people dont like that film on the pudding
so you can put $unc$saran $unc$wrap over the top
uh-huh
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the $unc$saran $unc$wrap
so when you pull the $unc$saran $unc$wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the $unc$saran $unc$wrap
and i might put it back on
but
do you put it in the refrigerator then
or y-
yeah
when it starts steaming a lot i definitely put it in the refrigerator
uh-huh
but i
my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator youre going to make it work too hard
right
thats true
i knew that
thats
yeah
yeah
thats why i do that
yeah
i dont know
thats my great hard recipe
okay
could you tell me what you think contributes most to air pollution
its hard to say
while its certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories pollute a lot if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano its certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all
what do you think
you talked about volcanos
im not sure how many active volcanos there are now and what the amount of material that they do put into the atmosphere
i think probably the greatest cause is vehicles especially around cities
uh-huh
do you live right in the city itself
no
im more out in the suburbs
but i certainly work near a city
okay
so can you notice
how about you
its
i live in a rural area
uh-huh
its mainly farms and no heavy industry
$unc$attleboro itself
i live in $unc$rhode $unc$island
i see
and its in the north
i live up in the northeast corner
and $unc$attleboro sits just over the line where $unc$t is plant is
uh-huh
but there isnt a lot of heavy industry
theres the freeways
and we get an occasional
it depends which way the winds blowing from $unc$boston cause were $unc$forty miles south of $unc$boston
so well pick up that
and ive noticed over the past say maybe $unc$five or $unc$six years
we live about $unc$twenty miles away from the state airport
and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger
theyre swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes
uh-huh
and it seems like were catching all that residue
im not sure if its kerosene or what thats dropping
but other than that we dont have unless were catching it from the midwest the emissions from the power plants
yeah
you mean from the coal
yeah
yeah
we generate
$unc$one of our biggest electrical plants in $unc$rhode $unc$island uses coal to generate electricity
there doesnt seem to be much emission from them
but im not sure about the rest of the country
yeah
i notice locally a major problem is $unc$kodak
its interesting
because in order to keep with the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a standards which tend to be whats coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night
so people get up
okay
is that right
yeah
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
and theyve got this black ash on their cars which seems to be
yeah
surprise surprise
yeah
i really think that if the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a had anything on the ball theyd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and
yeah
there must be some of the larger plants up around $unc$one $unc$hundred $unc$twenty-eight
uh-huh
weve got reports that
during the night seems like theyd blow off their stacks from the warehouses for powerhouses
right
uh-huh
and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and spots all over them
right
yeah
yeah
so youre right
they could do something about that i guess
yeah
that seems a little ridiculous
how are your lakes
and
theyve been getting cleaner
they have
sure
but yeah
im not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain
yeah
acid rain
yeah
thats what i was
the stuff ive read recently in $unc$technology $unc$review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit overstated that a lot of the die off theyve seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all
ye-
im not an expert
yeah
no
didnt they just have an article on
they were dumping lime
up here
upstate $unc$new $unc$york somewhere over huge areas
i havent read that
yeah
and they thought that was more beneficial because some of it does soak in
and some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
uh-huh
i cant remember where
i read that recently somewhere
and i cant remember where
yeah
thats interesti-
but i thought it was up there
so thats interesting because $unc$new $unc$hampshire and parts of $unc$vermont they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
uh-huh
you kind of think its something else then
thats what the environmentalists were claiming in this article
so that
they didnt say what though
they just said they thought it was
they didnt say what
they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected that it may be other natural things at work
natural disease
yeah
so its less than clear
like i said i dont remember the article that well
yeah
yeah
but i dont know
what do you think we can i guess as individuals or as a group do about air pollution
we can demand more efficient automobiles for $unc$one thing
i still think thats $unc$one of our major causes of pollutants
uh-huh
how we go about that its a little bit difficult
i think its up to individuals too to ask automakers for less pollutant vehicles
yeah
yeah
i think you need a vehicle something like naders $unc$raiders or $unc$a $unc$a $unc$r $unc$p which has a lot of members if you can get those types of groups
yeah
uh-huh
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem
i remember reading an article that said its the older polluters
the $unc$twelve and $unc$fifteen year old cars contribute $unc$ninety percent of the automobile pollution
yeah
and the new cars is hardly anything
yeah
theyre better
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
when was the last time you saw a truck that didnt belch smoke or
yeah
but doesnt that just mean theyre out of tune
im not really sure
you think that the trucking industry is that incompetent that they wouldnt
fuel is $unc$one of their biggest costs
right
so you would
but diesel engines
yeah
diesel engines
it
they do generate a lot of soot
but at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
yeah
yeah
we could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems
this country seems to be a little behind on that
yeah
on the other hand most people dont use rapid transit because its so inconvenient
yeah
but only because we got used to single person single car driving
uh-huh
a lot of people dont even like to carpool
uh-huh
but we could that
thatll help air pollution
uh-huh
the $unc$united $unc$states and $unc$canada is going into some types of agreements to limit whats being given out by power plants
uh-huh
i guess canadas quite concerned that were sending a lot of our stuff up there
yeah
sure
so thats helping
what do you think about a device a meter right on a tail pipe
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted
thats an idea
dont say that too loud though because every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue
it just means if you dont pollute or you pollute very little you dont have to pay any tax
or you just buy $unc$one of these things
and it
maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
and the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
and you couldnt start your car anymore
thats an interesting concept
is that your idea
yeah
but its
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something
i was going to say
right
it could be installed like a catalytic converter
right
i guess you could take those off too
but
you could take ca-
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
yeah
if you can take a muffler off and only replace
not unless it was built into every muffler
right
and thats
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
thats quite a concept
you should pursue that i think or patent it
yeah
patent it
thats a good idea
if you could come up with a device thats the thing
right
but it shouldnt be too hard to do something like that
but thats a thought
no
uh-huh
youre right
and that will solve a lot of problems
i dont know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
uh-huh
but a proposal to i guess the proper authorities
uh-huh
yeah you might generate some interest in it
yeah
the automobile regulatory agencies or something
but thats a good idea
other than that im not sure what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
uh-huh
what are your music interests
just about any kind of music except acid rock
i dont care for acid rock
me too
oh
but i grew up with country and western
yeah
i did too
but
and then
just about any kind of music
i even like classical music
yeah
im pretty diversified too
i dont like acid rock either
i grew up in a small town
so we only had $unc$one radio station
so it was country music
yeah
but then when i
yeah
i grew up with $unc$hank $unc$snow and $unc$lefty $unc$frizzell and $unc$hank $unc$williams and all of those old country and western songs
really
youre older than i am
but i
did you happen to see last night the special on channel $unc$two with $unc$james $unc$galway
we dont get channel $unc$two
our cable doesnt
oh
i wish we got that what
but
that is fabulous
was it
we dont get channel $unc$two
we
yeah
when he played $unc$danny $unc$boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
really
yeah
and it was tremendous
he is a
actually i did
i played flute for almost $unc$ten years
yeah
so i appreciate his too his mus-
yeah
hes from $unc$ireland isnt he
yeah
uh-huh
and it was mostly all irish tunes
was i-
yeah
they had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle and a couple of violins and drum
yeah
uh-huh
and they played all the irish jigs and so forth
it was just fabulous
yeah
he is really good
yeah
i come from a musical background
yeah
so ive played flute and piano
so i have a big appreciation for music up to a point
yeah
yeah
im getting now to the age where i dont like much of the new stuff thats coming out
yeah
yeah
my husband says im getting old
yeah
i especially like instrumentals
do you
yeah
i love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
yeah
thats nice to do that is
ive got a $unc$two year old whos now getting
im getting well versed in kiddy music
yeah
ive never played an instrument in my life
ive always wanted too
yeah
ive always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something
yeah
but
i was $unc$one of the forced ones
but id just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
i could never do that
and
i was never that brave
but yeah
i guess the closest ive ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir
yeah
yeah
ive done that at church too
yeah
i havent done that in a long time
yeah
so lets see
what els-
what kind of music do you not like
like i say the acid rock
i just do not ca-
an i dont care for rap music either
go-
thats not music
uh-huh
no
that is not
i dont know what that is
but thats not music
if i cant understand the words i dont want to listen to it
its not music
its just talking in a beat
its not exciting at all
yeah
it doesnt give you relaxation
yeah
you cant dance to it
you cant do anything to it
right
but i like orchestra music too like the $unc$boston $unc$pops or anything
yeah
d-
yeah
have you ever been to the $unc$dallas $unc$symphony
uh-huh
have you
are they good
yeah
yeah
theyre good
are they
i have never been
and we went and saw $unc$les $unc$miserables
really
the music in that was fantastic
ive heard that that is a really
yeah
i heard that was hard to get tickets to
yeah
it
i cant remember how far in advance we reserved tickets
but it was out at the $unc$state $unc$fair $unc$music $unc$hall
and it was well worth the price
yeah
yeah
that was a real
was it
yeah
i bet it was
yeah
i really bet it was
is that the only musical
do you go see a lot of musicals
just ever so often a real good one like that one
yeah
and
that would be nice
i went and saw i think it was sugar babies
that was good
that had good music in it
was it
how
i dont know what thats about
that was the one with $unc$mickey $unc$rooney
and whats that not real old my wife she is old too dancer
i cant think of her name
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and cant say it $unc$helen something
i know who youre talking about
real long legs and dark hair
shes got black hair
yeah
okay
i know who your talking about
i cant think ever her name either
i cant think of it
yeah
that was
i remember that being here a few years ago
yeah
but
the last country music
my parents still really like country music
yeah
and they like the $unc$oak $unc$ridge $unc$boys and the $unc$statler $unc$brothers
yeah
yeah
and my parents
the $unc$blackwoods
yeah
my husband likes country music real well
and he likes some of the new groups like $unc$shenandoah
yeah
and yeah
he really likes $unc$shenandoah
$unc$alabama
yeah
yeah
yeah
$unc$alabama
i think theyre a bit over exposed
yeah
i get tired of every other song being $unc$alabama on the radio
yeah
either $unc$alabama or $unc$hank $unc$williams $unc$junior
ive never cared for $unc$hank $unc$williams $unc$junior
i never have either
and i never have figured out how he won entertainer of the year for about $unc$three or $unc$four years in a row
oh
we watch those award shows too
we enjoy watching the country and the $unc$grammies and stuff
but i just dont care for him
yeah
i just never have
i dont
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is probably $unc$eddy $unc$arnold
is it
uh-huh
okay
i think i know who that is
uh-huh
i think my parents have some of his records
but i sold some of them i had about a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty old $unc$seventy-eight r p m records of country and western songs
yeah
wow
$unc$smiley $unc$burnette i dont know if you were old enough to remember him
ive heard the name
he played in the old western movies
he was the sidekick of $unc$gene $unc$autry i believe
or they
i think his name in the movie was $unc$froggy
and
ive never seen a $unc$gene $unc$autry movie
had a real raspy voice
and
no
i never have
some of those old ones of course $unc$bob $unc$wills $unc$miss $unc$texas $unc$playboys $unc$ernest $unc$tubbs and $unc$red $unc$foley an
yeah
yeah
those go back quite a way
yeah
i took them up here to $unc$collectors $unc$records and was able to get a little money for them
yeah
but my mother and dad use to own a restaurant
its hard to
yeah
and they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant
yeah
and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records
that wou-
thats neat
so thats where i got my
that would be great if they werent too worn out at the time
yeah
of course theres not a whole lot of market for $unc$seventy-eight r p m records
is there not
youd think there would be
the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that particular kind of needle
thats true
yeah
and they just wont play on a modern day phonograph
thats a shame
because we go to antique stores a lot
and you see seventy-eights a lot at record stores
yeah
youd think thered be a market for
yeah
im sure you could find old players for them
but that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked
yeah
yeah
oh
of course they just dont have the quality of records nowadays either because you get that scratchy sound
no
uh-huh
those things were big and thick werent they
yeah
yeah
you could kill somebody with them
yeah
th-
warped real easy
and the ones you buy
go out and buy $unc$one now
and theyre just so thin and flimsy
yeah
and theyre not meant to last at all
yeah
neither are tapes
we buy cassette tapes
yeah
and machines will eat them
yeah
and so the best bet these days are compact disk
those things are practically indestructible
but i guess the old country and western music you
back then when i was a kid there wasnt that much t v
no
so thats all you had to listen to was the radio
radio
and
thats just what you had
we-
plus
yeah
i think it was better back then to
theres too much t v now
yeah
and the radio is more exciting really than television
yeah
kep-
your imagination
yeah
i- kept
and yo-
it just didnt vegetate your mind like television does
yeah
i remember mother and dad always turned on the $unc$grand $unc$ole $unc$opera
yeah
yeah
was it on the radio every week
yeah
what day was that on
can you recall
seems like it was on a $unc$friday
$unc$friday or
okay
okay
what do you think about the idea of kids having to do public service work for a year
do you think its a
i think its a pretty good idea
i think they should either do that or afford some time to the military or helping elderly people
yes
yes
def-
i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
and im not sure that thats not a bad idea
thats true
or the military for a year or $unc$two wouldnt be bad for
yeah
i think it teaches kids how to grow
how about yourself
i agree with you
what im thinking about is back when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of i-
the parents kind of pushed them to join the $unc$boy $unc$scouts or $unc$girl $unc$scouts
and they did do a lot of public service activities
but these days theyre not
parents arent encouraging their kids to do things like that
because when i was in the $unc$girl $unc$scouts we did a lot of public service things because thats just part of the scouting and
yeah
ive
thats really great
i really think that both the $unc$boy $unc$scouts and $unc$girl $unc$scouts is $unc$two excellent organizations
they are
but parents
kids seem like when they get $unc$ten or $unc$twelve years old they fall out of that
yeah
they do
and they dont follow it at all
there are very few $unc$scouts go on and become $unc$eagle $unc$scouts
no
and i dont know what the high rank is for the gals
but
i
senior
oh
senior
okay
so theres not
theyre just not
once they get into junior high it just not done anymore
yeah
they lose interest
and then when they young adults theres even less interest there
uh-huh
theyre more for i g-
me
not
yeah
grab
grab
grab
walk out
yeah
youre absolutely right
yeah
i think its really a good thing
i like to see
of course theres third world countries that can use all kind of help
yeah
but theres a lot that can be done right here in this country too
but i think we ought to start right here at home
im
yeah
im not so sure that helping overseas would be such a hot idea for a lot of young people
no
it
but since there is much that needs to be done here
i think that we need to really address what weve done here
and then perhaps even a $unc$six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
uh-huh
its been really good
we talked about this for a few minutes
and hopefully well have other good topic maybe another call someday
but i dont really have too much more to say on this topic i guess
no
i agree with you
i guess we both agree that its a good thing that they should do sometime
yeah
okay
you take care
and enjoy the day
you too
you too
thank you maam
bye-bye
bye-bye
are you on a regular exercise program right now
yes
and i hate it
how about you
im kind of off and on
off and on
i guess ive been kind of off and on
ive had some health problems that have led me to
right now im kind of off
id say more on than off
okay
what type of exercise do you do
i do walking on the treadmill
and then i do low impact aerobics
okay
i guess you dont enjoy that very much
not really
do you find that to be boring
yeah
and time consuming
its not just the exercise thats boring and time consuming
its afterwards
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up
yeah
im trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
yeah
but i
is this something that you go through every year
yeah
i havent decided whether i want to play yet or not
i just bought myself a $unc$solo $unc$flex machine
i dont know if youve seen those advertised on t v
uh-huh
its $unc$one of those universal type exercise machines
but i havent really sat down and used it match yet
so its collecting dust right now
yeah
a lot of things do that
i had an exercise bike
i used to jog somewhat
i use to have $unc$one
and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it
but i do use my treadmill
uh-huh
thats good
yeah
my parents have a treadmill
its
when i go visit them i get on that thing every now and then
yeah
its nice because when the weathers bad you dont have any excuse
uh-huh
i just got the bicycle out today
and it was real nice outside
had to get out to do something
yeah
i cant ride a bike
so
ive been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
so thought i better get outside and do something and not waist the day
oh
yeah
its too nice
its been too nice all weekend
but yeah
i need to start something again
ive always of that to be really $unc$one of the best forms of exercise
but its terribly boring
and so i really dont ever keep a program up consistently
have you ever had any injuries from jogging
no
i never have
i dont job enough i think to develop any injuries
i usually only go about a mile or $unc$two
i guess it worries me about jogging that i hear that its very hard on your body and that you can end up getting hurt worse
yeah
its tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt
uh-huh
suppose to be much better if you find grass or dirt to jog on
yeah
thats not quite so easy
you have to have the right type of shoes too
thats very important
yeah
yeah
i found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts
but
yeah
i dont have to buy jogging shoes all to often
my dont get very much use
i guess my breakdown they say about every $unc$six months
uh-huh
i usually enjoy the exercise i do
but like i said im just not very consistent about maintaining a program
so ill bicycle
i get into that for a little while and maybe go out on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile
but then ill get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about $unc$three or $unc$four nights a week
but that gets old too in a very short order
yeah
im hoping that this $unc$solo $unc$flex will change things a little bit
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
yeah
dont let it collect dust
at least exercise while dusting it off
yeah
maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this string i can start some type of regular program
yeah
thatll be good
ive always found that when you write things down and set goals its a lot easier to keep something going
uh-huh
when i was in high school we had a choice of taking physical education courses on exercise
an $unc$one of those involved a $unc$six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and working out like that
oh
and that was very helpful
we kept charts of our progress and consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
uh-huh
i found that to be very helpful
are you going to do that
i need to
i havent started yet
but its a thought
that sounds like something good to do then
sounds like something i should do
yeah
nice way to start off this spring get back in shape
how often do you go out each week on your walking
i do
i switch every other day
$unc$one day i walk
and $unc$one day i do the aerobics
okay
about how far do you go walking
im trying to get my tolerance now
i just had surgery less then $unc$two months ago
and right now im just a little over about a mile and a half
okay
but im trying to workup to $unc$three miles
thats good
they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging
yeah
it
its just that it takes longer to get to the same effect
sure
yeah
but
if you keep up with a consistent pace just to keep the heart rating going
my walkman broke
yeah
so im upset
and i just have to turn to stereo up real loud
yeah
but its a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is
yeah
it is
and this doesnt
my treadmill has an incline
and you can get a really good workout on it
do you go to an aerobics class
or do you watch on t v
no
i just do it on t v
okay
i have a cassette
which shows do you watch on t v
its a tap-
i use tapes
okay
okay
like a $unc$cathy $unc$smith workout
or $unc$richard $unc$simmons
or $unc$jane $unc$fonda
okay
sweating to the oldies
right
every now and then ill watch $unc$e $unc$s $unc$p $unc$n
i get cable on t v
uh-huh
and they have a couple of shows called basic training
and what is the other one called
there was $unc$one guy i use to watch on $unc$e $unc$s $unc$p $unc$n
i dont know if hes still on any more or not
i dont know if i get $unc$e $unc$s $unc$p $unc$n or not
uh-huh
but $unc$one
i use to watch $unc$one on the air
but that was back
bodies in motion thats the name of the one i was thinking of with $unc$gill
thats was
yeah
yeah
yeah
i watched that cause he was cute
yeah
hes not bad
his assistants usually arent either
but
theyre always in $unc$hawaii some place on the beach
yeah
yeah
but then that was back when the high impact and
yeah
they do low i pact stuff now
do they
are the-
yeah
hes still doing it then
yeah
every morning
ill have to tune in
its on $unc$e $unc$s $unc$p $unc$n
at what time
i cant remember what time
its
i cant remember offhand what time
ill have to check it back up
yeah
but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show at least on
yeah
every now and then
not everybody has a picture perfect body
uh-huh
i found that they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on t v
i havent watch any other ones on t v just on some of the tapes
theyre on weekdays at $unc$eleven oclock every day $unc$monday through $unc$friday incase youre interested in that
okay
thanks
but i havent done so much as watch the tape that i made
thats a thought
so im kind of bad about that myself
thats thought
i havent thought about that
theyre going to beep us pretty soon
okay
i sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness
nice talking to you too
okay
thanks
all right
talk to you later
good night
bye
bye
what would you say your opinion is on gun control
i dont know
ive had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to the radio and watch t v about the different things that are happening
im against it
but on the same token i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that
ye-
so i have a rifle in the house
the ammunition is probably so old im afraid to use it
but i bought it for target practicing and also because i wanted a weapon
how do you feel about it
i think down here in $unc$texas they dont have a waiting period on handguns
and i think they need that
and i have a pistol
its a little $unc$twenty-two
and i have or a $unc$twelve gauge shotgun
uh-huh
an- i do like to have my guns
i dont know if ill ever use it
and like you my bullets to my little pistols probably about $unc$three years old
my gun hasnt been shot in a year or $unc$two
uh-huh
but i like to have them handy
up in $unc$new $unc$england where im from you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition
and i thought that was really good
and i think if they
takes $unc$two weeks for that system to process your request not as a gun permit but to buy ammunition
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that
ive never heard of anything like that
yeah
that would be nice
but a-
the criminals that are going to get their guns $unc$one way or the other
i agree
i think $unc$one of the things that needs to happen is to stop the impulse buyer from buying it quickly and maybe putting a weeks waiting period or something on it
but if someones really determined to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place
yeah
and you can get them really cheap
i know
i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in $unc$tennessee and they had a waiting period
uh-huh
and we bought it there
and
how long was the waiting period out there
about $unc$nine days
that wasnt too bad
no
no
because if youre going to go buy something of that nature i think youre going to have some idea as to what youre going to do with it
youre not going to react that quickly
in other words you dont have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
th-
somebody wants to do that
at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
yeah
i do too because it doesnt make any difference whether its a pistol or a shotgun i suppose
they both do the same kind of job
a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
yeah
i suppose
i never got shot with either $unc$one
but i dont know
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
no
a shotguns got too much of a spread
or at least ours does
yeah
its
you have a little thing on top of the barrel where you turn it
uh-huh
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get
oh
and the spread changes
ive got a manual single shot
and i guess it doesnt have any automatic features to it
the further away i get the wider the shot gets from the target
yeah
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
its got a hell of a kick to it
yeah
my husband had a police gun at $unc$one time
and i shot that thing $unc$one time
almost knocked me down
and it just a li-
i forget
i think it was a $unc$three $unc$fifty-seven
im not sure
do you belong to a gun club or you
he belonged to $unc$one awhile back
since we moved
weve only been here in $unc$texas for about a year
uh-huh
and we cant even find a place to shoot just for target practice
no kidding
id love to get used to that shotgun
we traded his pistol for that shotgun
the clubs that weve got around here are kind of expensive
but its well worth it
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have competition
ive never really joined a club because i havent got the time not because i havent got the desire
theres an annual membership fee thats fairly high
plus theres an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time member
so the whole process can cost you a $unc$hundred $unc$fifty dollars to join the club
plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
yeah
thats what my husband
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that
it
he went mostly just to shoot at paper targets
uh-huh
but they used speed and accuracy and all that
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose
in fact id like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to show that youve gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
thats a good
ive never thought of that
thats a good point
and it
even after you wait your $unc$nine days if you dont know how to handle it its just like putting someone in an automobile that doesnt know how to drive
and you give him a license because he waited $unc$nine days
yeah
thats
and yeah
he could not only shoot himself
he could mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it
it
we was living on a navy base down in $unc$memphis
and this $unc$one guy decided to play lonesome cowboy or something
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
wow
he was fortunate
he could of hit something else
he went tumbling down the steps along with shooting his foot almost off
he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things im sure being $unc$mister cowboy
wow
i cant remember what the term was going around
it was about $unc$four or $unc$five years ago
but i guess that would be a good idea
about private citizens selling a weapons
if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
how do you feel about that
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the buyer and the seller
or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system because you own it
thats a hard one because we did that
but i think there ought to be some rule against it
ill
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that guns registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you
yeah
isnt there a way to deregister yourself after you register a gun
i have no idea
ive only had $unc$one gun
because i have
and ive kept it know the $unc$one gun that was in my name
yeah
is it registered
yeah
i-
the rifle that ive got is not registered
and i dont know why i never registered it
but the
i dont think you have to register a shotgun
i think its voluntary
the
my husband has a thing
if they go to all right banning guns private citizens
yeah
this
my kid is jumping on me
i cant hardly talk
my husband feels that theyll come and collect everybodys guns
yeah
i guess that could happen
its just like the social security system
once they gave everybody a number
and now theyre making you get $unc$one at birth
and once they have your number they have your identification
yeah
and if you try to do anything like not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
yeah
and everything about you
and thats true
i
bu- they know how much money you make a week to probably your
my kid is banging
i was seeing what they was banging on
ive lost my train of thought
im sorry
thats all right
you were talking about what the federal government knows about people
the soc-
yeah
they probably know everything from half the time what time you go to the bathroom
they probably do
no
thats a little bit extreme
but they could know anything and everything about you
and id like to have my gun
if they go to banning them id lose my gun
but we wouldnt lose our shotgun
yeah
and were wanting to get a couple of more that no $unc$one knows about
uh-huh
but i dont
do you find it difficult picking up guns that are not registered
no
no
i dont either
i can buy some today if i wanted to
just put up the money
yeah
w-
yeah
you can look in the
we got a thing down here called a $unc$shopper
uh-huh
its a bargain thing
you go and always see guns in there $unc$five to $unc$seven guns a day
yeah
it comes out every $unc$tuesday
and theres no waiting period on that
no
none whatsoever
you call
we sold a refrigerator through it
and it took us all of $unc$twelve hours
to sell the refrigerator
yeah
yeah
and im sure itd be even less for somebody with a good gun
and i think the federal government is really far away from control
i dont believe in
i shouldnt probably say control
i mean regulation
control is something that i wouldnt want the federal government to have
but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
yeah
i agree with you there
they do have too much control over us already
yeah
we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
unfortunately we vote for the people who spend the money
so i cant complain too much
yeah
i guess so
i dont know
theyre
i havent heard anything about the proposal myself
but i dont know if its their proposal or $unc$one thats being seriously kicked around
no
i havent either
ive always felt for a long time that i think that all young kids ought to do a stint primarily in the military
yeah
most countries require that now
they have it mandatory for at least the young men
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i dont know about the young women
i dont know if they have to serve in the military too
yeah
a lot
yeah
you take $unc$israel
everybody does
yeah
i dont think its a bad idea
teaches a lot
i went in the service when i was $unc$eighteen and stayed in for $unc$ten years
uh-huh
is that right
yeah
did a lot of growing up
i bet
you have to
yeah
yeah
my father had been in the military
i didnt do it myself
my father had
and thats how he put himself through school basically
yeah
he came from a poor immigrant family
and he didnt have a chance to
the family wasnt wealthy
so he had to do something to put himself through school
do it himself
and he did
and he was very successful
my parents wanted to send me to college
and i was dead set against it
i had wanderlust
yeah
and i got in
and after wasting the first $unc$six years partying and everything else i decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something
so i started to work on my education
yeah
course my job was such that i couldnt do it as much as i wanted
uh-huh
and still i ended up going $unc$two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
thats pretty good
but ive been in school ever since
thats good
yeah
i guess
yeah
thats
i dont know
theres other kinds of service to the country that could be done
yeah
if you dont like
working in the national parks working clean up the roadsides
sure
exactly
ive always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to go out and clean up the roads
yeah
absolutely
all this money that were throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when were paying all these welfare recipients
and if theyre able-bodied people i dont see any problem at all with having them go out there and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
yeah
yeah
wed learn service to other people in this country
sure
sure
so im
get something out of that money
country would benefit
yeah
ive
yeah
yeah
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
and
that right
yeah
and he had all kinds of horror stories
these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks
and back in those days they also use to give you booklets good for clothing and gas and things like this
yeah
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games
yeah
and i have a hard time dealing with that
what i hear $unc$one time i think it was on $unc$paul harveys radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like $unc$forty-five $unc$thousand dollars
uh-huh
i was astounded
i dont even make that
no
i know
you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
yeah
and somebodys taking that away
and theres easily probably $unc$six or $unc$seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
yeah
no doubt
its totally ridiculous
and when i first got in graduate school
i was going into public administration
and quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldnt stand it any more
is that right
yeah
this is the kind of thing you look at
yeah
you sit there
and when youre writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need
you need $unc$x number dollars for the recipients
but you need $unc$x number dollars to administer the program
just ridiculous
yeah
this is ridiculous
its sad
it is
its pathetic
theres got to be a different way
theres got to be a better way
but itll never happen
these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
yeah
yeah
what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country
what should they get in return i wonder
i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as
and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
yeah
give an incentive
educational or vocational training or something
yeah
something thats going to help them along the way
and theyll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
sure
this
look at the statistics
and thats only going to help
its sad
$unc$one in $unc$five $unc$americans cant read
yeah
adults that is cant even read
and weve got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
yeah
what are we becoming
were becoming a service country
as opposed to what we were $unc$twenty years ago
yeah
we were an industrial giant
and now were not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game
we taught them how to do it
and they did it better than we do
yeah
simple as that
because they have the ambition i guess
yeah
simple as that
yeah
which is good for them
but on the other hand we kind of lose out
yeah
its terrible for us
i think that if young people had service to the country might give them more ambition because they learn that serving other people is a good thing
yeah
yeah
and it can be good for them too
yeah
yeah
even the greedy kids that weve got now
god you go to the mall
and you see $unc$fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night
i know
for what
i know
give me the money
and ill teach them something good
you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
yeah
yeah
thats my other complaint
parents arent parents any more
no
theyve relinquished their parenting
yeah
$unc$one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble
yeah
as a substitute teacher for a year i can say yes
yeah
i talked with somebody else about that another time
and when is in graduate school working on my masters degree in math i was teaching as part of the program
and i just love teaching
thats probably the most fun i had
and it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently
yeah
uh-huh
and when come time to get out of school i thought boy id like to teach
but for what
yeah
i dont want to live in a little $unc$one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
exactly
thats a sad thing to think
and thats kind of selfish on my part
and i admit that
in a way it is
but you have to look out for yourself
yeah
thats right
thats some-
and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
thats wrong
yeah
gosh
im not saying that garbage men should be paid less
i saying teachers should be paid more
no
yeah
they do an absolutely necessary job
i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
yeah
but theres a sense of priorities here too
yeah
we need
whats more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
yeah
they both have their place
yeah
they
sure
but when it gets right down to it
ones import-
on the other hand you take a garbage man in $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city starts out at $unc$twenty-six $unc$thousand dollars
thats pretty good
i bet you theres a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for $unc$thirteen $unc$thousand dollars a year
yeah
my other pet peeve is unions
yeah
yeah
its ridiculous the way unions have gone
there was a time when unions were needed
and they served a good function
and they served a good function
but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated
and theyre only there to perpetuate their own power structure
i remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management
it was a steel manufacturing place
and they
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap
and they were having a hard time
and they told the strikers there look
we need you to come back and get this stuff done
or else were going to be out of business
and they wouldnt come back
so they went bankrupt
yeah
and they all lost their jobs
sure
and thats really what happened to the steel industry in this country
and its like
yeah
so many times you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time
and that took care of that industry
thats right
and ill tell you
$unc$detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country
and theyre trying to do that now with the imports
yeah
weve never caught up
and i dont think we ever will
itll be a tough road though
yeah
here it is
and weve got to go into partnership with the $unc$japanese to build cars
yeah
and they only did it because i guess they were embarrassed that theyre so good at it
yeah
thats about right
gosh
yeah
back to the original subject
yeah
i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service
i dont care what kind it is
it teaches them pride in their country
yeah
and pride in themselves too
thats right
you could organize something just within your community same old thing
yeah
thats right
thats like $unc$eagle $unc$scouts
sure
uh-huh
and thats a great idea
i think they ought to take them and i dont know just have sort of like a manpower pool and say okay look
we need somebody
okay
were going to talk about the public school system whats wrong with it or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
okay
fantastic
$unc$one thing that pops into my mind real quick is about the funding of the school system right now
yeah
evidently thats a big problem
yeah
its amazing
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough to be doing what theyre doing
right
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching
cause i did some teaching part-time
and i really enjoyed that
but i wouldnt want to go teach high school or junior high
it just all the problems
lord yeah
an you talk about stress and pressure
i tell you what
its
yeah
theyre putting in $unc$fifty $unc$sixty hours a week
im sure because theyve got to grade papers and get class stuff ready
do
right
and theyre being paid probably half what most people being paid
exactly
and
and were paying basketball people millions of dollars a year for what
thats right
and then they poof it off do like $unc$tarpley
yeah
but i
what gets me is i cant believe that our state legislature cant come up with some kind of workable means to have funds for the school
its
i just dont understand that
yeah
its
do you have little kids or what
no
sure dont
my wife and ive just been married about $unc$two years
but i have a sister thats a school teacher
and
yeah
yeah
my wife and i have a $unc$three year old almost $unc$four and a $unc$two year old
okay
so were looking at the older one going to school next year not this coming fall but the year after that
okay
so its getting close
yeah
hes going to be going to kindergarten
so were thinking about that
right
whats that going to be like
are they going to be taught nothing
or they going be taught something
were going to be involved in our childs education
were going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because i guess we dont trust the school system which is very sad
right
but if it doesnt start at home its not going to go anywhere
exactly
right
thats true
and were going to try to teach him good values because when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them hey if you can play football or basketball thats whats important not if you can read or write or understand some science
exactly
give me a break
thats bogus
right
right
and $unc$one thing my wife and ive talked about are private schools whether we would want to invest in private schools as theyre growing up because just in the $unc$dallas area were not real comfortable with the public schools
yeah
and $unc$dallas school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
right
i couldnt believe that
right
thats $unc$one reason we bought a house here in $unc$plano
we were hoping the school districts going to be good for resale value and so on and so forth
yeah
but i can definitely see on down the road where we do have kids and are getting to that age thats going to be a definite concern
yeah
you talked before about the school funding
i think theres only going to be $unc$one solution to school funding which i dont think will be necessarily the best way
but i think whats going to have to happen is theres going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
thats the only way theyre going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property people are going to throw a fit
thats
yeah
and thats
taxes right now are political suicide
yeah
and i dont think any politicians going to do that
so
yeah
and the only thing they would think of would be tuition
if it works at colleges it will work down below
right
and thats going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
but it will be hard for people that have in school because they have to pay out even more
exactly
and its going to really hurt the middle class people i think because theyre the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load
yeah
thats right
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything
good grief whats
yeah
thats just unbelievable to me
i cant believe that
when i was in junior high and high school that never happened
you never heard about that
yeah
we didnt even think about it
no
and now what do we have now
got kids that either got a $unc$magnum gun school
good grief
right
id be afraid to b- teaching or even being a student
and think whats it going to be like for my oldest son when he goes to school
whats going to happen
im afraid for him to go
exactly
right
but there again you cant hold them back
another reason yo-
and you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school
but with all the peer pressure thats going on with all the negative things its a tough environment to be growing up in
yeah
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school
and that was
i graduated high school in $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-nine
so
okay
that was what $unc$twelve years ago i guess
right
so its lot different now
and whats it going to be like in another $unc$twelve years when my oldest son is in high school
thats right
thats right
im afraid to even think about it
yeah that is a scary thought
but i dont know
i guess what you have to do is just keep encouraging them and try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up
thats all you can do
yeah
and
you got to be your childs best friend i guess even when theyre a teenager and they are kind of standoffish
right
still you got to be their best friend because when theyve got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or your parents
exactly
and if they go to their friends dealing drugs theyre going to be in even worse shape
thats right
and the schools dont really encourage to stay away from that
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war $unc$etcetera $unc$etcetera
they dont teach them good values like drugs are bad
maybe im wrong because i havent been in that kind of environment for a long time
but it just is amazing
right
need to teach them good values
thats true
thats true
and
of course if i say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say no
and the $unc$a $unc$c $unc$l $unc$u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit which is going to take $unc$twenty years to resolve
right
and i think you touched on it
youve got to start them at the home
yeah
thats where they get the deep rooted values
and thats about right
thats all you can do
then you just have to hope and pray that everything works out okay
so
thats right
i got to be going
so
okay
hey i appreciate the call
nice talking to you today
you to
have a good life
hi $unc$wanet
how are you
im doing fine
where you from
im from $unc$new $unc$england
$unc$massachusetts
okay
im from $unc$berkeley $unc$california
wow!
this is quite a long distance
yeah
it certainly is
do you have any pets
no
use too
use to
but none right now
how come you dont have any now
you get tired of them
i live in an apartment building
and its just not feasible
yeah
id love to have a dog
ive got a little doggy that ive had quite a long time
in fact she just turned $unc$sixteen years old $unc$new years $unc$eve
and
is she
i beg your pardon
what is she
shes a poodle
a toy poodle
and shes
ah
ah
i got my mom a teacup little mutt not too long ago
this is a little bigger than a teacup
yeah
and its funny how i acquired this animal
when i was married my ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that the woman needed someone to baby-sit
and this is what she had told the kids
and she even told me that
and after the $unc$two week period was up she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it
after you had an animal for a couple of weeks you become attached to it
for sure
yeah
so ive had this dog now for $unc$sixteen years
and shes been a lot of company
shes however getting a little old
and things are starting to fail
i live alone now
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
and shes been holding herself pretty well up until recently where shes been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
and i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
but shes usually pretty good
yes
my mother has $unc$one thats
its teacup
and its made such a difference for her
but just i e-
the way my moms presence countenance is just for having a puppy
but having this dog
shes had it for i guess $unc$three years now possibly $unc$four
uh-huh
but its really made such a difference for her
i really would like to
im a disabled person
uh-huh
so im unable to really take care of a pet
and if that werent so i would certainly have $unc$one
i just
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog
yeah
you might want to get yourself an animal that doesnt require much attention like a cat
yeah
yeah
i typically am not a cat person
i have a friend that has on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
and it would sleep on my chest
yeah
its just a great cat
but
my personal preference is a dog
i dont know that i would ever want a cat
i like cats
i just wouldnt want to own $unc$one
theyre affectionate
you dont own cats
but they
yeah
i dont know
i cant seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog
yeah
they own you or grant you with their presence
yeah
right
yeah
right
that
yes
were supposed to appreciate them
when i come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door
i dont know that a cat would do that
yeah
i used to have a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life
yeah
i could just walk in the door
and she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
she really could pick up on my mood the way i walked in the door
yeah
yeah
it was uncanny
i think in a way were able to read each other pretty well because she knows when im upset and i know when shes not feeling good too
so
yeah
i know when she has an accident i know shes not doing it on purpose
when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
yeah
and some people might not believe that
but i do
sure
absolutely
if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours because i was going out she would break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
really
yeah
thats the way
i had that cat that i mentioned $unc$alfie
$unc$one morning the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box
for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
uh-huh
and the next morning when my roommate got up and did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest
and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
all right have i got your attention now
yes
animals have a way of talking
$unc$alfie did
i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day
i dont know that id trade my dog in for the world
it was about $unc$two years ago she got sick on me
and i took her to the vets because she wasnt eating and she wasnt able to jump
she lost all her activity
and she stayed there for $unc$one day
and the doctor called me up and said she had a low white cell count and that she was dying and suggested that i take her to a animal hospital
so i took his suggestion
and i took the dog to the dog hospital there
and they said theyd keep her there for $unc$three days
she ended staying there $unc$five days at a $unc$hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
it cost me over $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars
ouch
plus the vet sent me a bill for what he did
and then she recouped
she was okay for a couple of years
and then she got sick on me again
and i brought her to a different vet this time
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything
and he gave me the same medication that i gave her the last time
and she was okay
and shes been okay every since
its been about $unc$two years now
thats great
it really is
im glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time
yeah
the problem is if someone would have came up to me and said its going to cost you $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars to keep your dog alive
what do you want to do
i probably would have had second thoughts
yeah
of course you would
but what they do is they say its going to cost $unc$twenty dollars for tests and $unc$forty dollars for this
and it creeps up on you
you dont know that
you dont know what its going to until its all over
to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who whoever evidently got a hold of it
and the cat got sick
so she took the cat to the vet
and she had the cat there for $unc$two days
and then the cat died
so the doctor had called her up and said your cat died
and you owe me this bill
and by the way do you want me to bury the cat
so it cost her $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars
and she didnt get the cat back
so yeah
they had to pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
and she just brought the cat in because he wasnt feeling good
so that was kind of a surprise
really
geez
at lea-
yeah
you kind of wonder what really happened
yeah
even the
they claimed they did the best that they could have
and then the cat died
so
my goodness
im looking for another cat for them
ive got a little kitten thats still just being born right now
so another $unc$five or $unc$six weeks ill be bringing the little kitten over to my folks
that will make their day
yeah
i think it will
because theyre both in their seventies and the cat although its a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns out to be a pleasant experience for them
i think they enjoy that
only work initially
yeah
for cats anyway
yeah
listen
its been a pleasure talking to you
the same here
and you take care
okay
bye now
maybe well talk again sometimes
okay
what is that sound
thats my buzzer at the door
okay
ill let you go
okay
right
thank you
what do you do to exercise
s-
i weight train $unc$three days on and $unc$one day off
uh-huh
i ride bicycles $unc$fifteen $unc$twenty miles i dont know maybe $unc$three times maybe $unc$four times a week
i play basketball couple times a week
i play softball $unc$one night a week
thats what i do
what about yourself
thats pretty impressive
i guess i bicycle
the amount varies
as much as a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty miles a week
uh-huh
i guess a play softball $unc$one night a week
and i backpack a lot over the summer
really
yeah
thats about the extent of it
i dont do any of those things particularly for exercise
but i guess the bicycling is the $unc$one thing ill sort of do if i feel like i need to go exercise
but i do it mostly for fun
yeah
what do you ride a bunch of hills or pretty flat
it varies
out near my house is pretty hilly
but sometimes i bike to work which is about a $unc$fifteen mile trip each way
and thats mostly flat
how long does that take you to get to work
about $unc$forty-five $unc$fifty minutes
how does that work out with storing your bike and showering and all that
yeah
it can be a pain
basically i work on a campus
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the campus to the gym use the shower there
uh-huh
but its enough of a pain that i did it consistently $unc$one year
i would commute every day
but it just became such a pain
were talking $unc$forty-five $unc$fifty minutes for biking and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind and then another half an hour to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff
right
it was a big hunk of the day
and then of course another hour to get back home
so ive been doing that less and concentrating more on light biking when i get home on the evening and then some more on the weekends
yeah
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there
not so much
i guess mostly i bike on my own
ive got a touring bike though i havent gone on any extended trips with it
uh-huh
how about you
what kind of biking do you do
actually my wife just got me into it
and i did an internship at the $unc$institute for $unc$aerobics $unc$research in $unc$dallas the $unc$cooper $unc$clinic
uh-huh
and i learned all the health benefits of
i was a solid weight trainer
uh-huh
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it
so once i got into this internship i learned all the physiological advantages to it
uh-huh
so i began a program i dont know probably $unc$three or $unc$four weeks ago
and i did my first bike rally this $unc$saturday
i did $unc$forty miles
and thats the longest ive ever ridden so far
i usually $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty
uh-huh
and it was kind of hilly
and it was pretty tough
but im looking at doing a lot more of it because my wife is really into it
i see
and i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend
she wanted to go go go
but she wanted to stay with me
uh-huh
its good to have a partner
yeah
it really is
are you think of doing any centuries or
yeah
that would be cool sometime if i could work up to that
uh-huh
yeah
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like touring from $unc$vermont or that kind of thing
oh
i mean people seem to get into different aspects
$unc$one is more of a distance
and ones more just
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
ive never really looked into that
thats
my wife would just love that
uh-huh
and i may do that sometime
there again im just kind of a fledgling into this
uh-huh
its kind of funny
i called this number
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
yeah
yeah
around $unc$texas you got about $unc$five or $unc$six
if you live around the $unc$dallas area you got $unc$five or $unc$six every weekend to choose from because theyre really into it
thats nice
bicycling is really big here
i didnt know that until i came down here and kind of caught the fever
wow
yeah
because i lived in $unc$indiana all my life
and you may say see $unc$one or $unc$two guys on a bicycle above the age of $unc$fifteen or something
uh-huh
but other than that its nothing up there like it is down here
yeah
im not sure why that is
generally in the $unc$midwest it seems to be much less
maybe its because of the winters or maybe just because theres a lot more flat lands out in the $unc$west
probably
yeah
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
yeah
theres a lot of bikers around here
its really neat
uh-huh
there are a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff
little $unc$texas $unc$bicyclist is a little newspaper that comes out every month
its free
just go to the bike shop and pick it up
and its got all the rides coming up
so i guess im going to be busy about every $unc$saturday this summer going to a different ride
thats terrific
yeah
see a little bit of $unc$texas ive never seen before
uh-huh
so how long have you been biking
i guess as an adult for just about the past $unc$three years or so
i guess last time i did it before that was college which was about $unc$ten years ago
yeah
and yeah
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot
and so i thought id try it too
have its kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a blood workup done recently or since youve been biking to see if it
no
i havent
no
because from what i understand it really improves your cholesterol
and it kind of knocks down $unc$two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is low cardiovascular fitness and also the cholesterol
uh-huh
it gives you increased $unc$h $unc$d $unc$ls and decreases your $unc$l $unc$d $unc$ls
thats great
yeah
so
yeah
ive definitely noticed its had a good effect on my resting pulse
yeah
it gets it down to about $unc$forty
really
yeah
thats good
yeah
you say you ride about a $unc$hundred $unc$hundred $unc$fifty miles a week
yeah
man
thats hard-core
on average
yeah
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that
what time of the year do you usually embark on your
do you ride inside if you cant ride outside
no
im not that hard-core
there are some people
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
theyve got a mountain bike with the big knobby tires
yeah
and i dont do that
i pretty much lay off for the winter
i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter because it will help your balance when youre indoor training
but i just more or less stocked an exercise bike and that kind of thing
but yeah
winters are kind of a problem
so im more or less out of shape now that ive been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
uh-huh
but up here its only stopped snowing since then
yeah
but yeah
its pretty good
its
the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like exercise and a chore ill lay off it more
right
so you change up your routes a lot and keep a
yeah
yeah
i try to go someplace pretty different every week
i rotate around about $unc$four different routes from my house
or ill sometimes come in the school
its nice riding to school because its all along a canal path
because its along the $unc$erie $unc$canal up here
what school is it
$unc$university of $unc$rochester
okay
yeah
so its fairly picturesque
yeah
so its a good ride
as long as youre not doing it every day its a good ride
yeah
thats true
sounds neat
yeah
its kind of
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesnt want to and everything else
but got a guy that rides a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty miles a week
thats motivating
yeah
thats really good
good talking to you
it was good talking to you
and keep up the good work
okay
you too
all right
take care
bye
bye
okay
far as crime in the cities im sure like in yours its pretty bad
probably the biggest thing weve got going now is the robberies
and theft and probably murder are the $unc$two top ones that we have
uh-huh
how about you
i dont actually live in the city
but id probably say thats roughly right
crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life
but i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff id say probably the police department would claim the number $unc$one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs
uh-huh
probably right if you look at it from that stand point
uh-huh
what
is there anything that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing
where i live now its not so bad
i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
but i do have friends that live in the city
and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing just because there are crack houses on their street and stuff like this
uh-huh
do you live in a real small town or out in the country
i live out in the country
yeah
how far out from the city do you
im about $unc$fifteen miles out
about $unc$fifteen miles
i live in a little suburb which i guess from $unc$dallas is $unc$twelve miles or so
uh-huh
but its pretty congested
we are considered in the country
but it doesnt really feel like youre in the country
our major crimes in our immediate town is probably house robberies and very few instances of alcohol drugs reported
uh-huh
however im sure theyre there
uh-huh
but right now our neighborhood is running about $unc$eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their existence in that neighborhood
wow
thats huge
and since that time everybodys got some sort of burglar system or burglar alarms and including the outer perimeter type devices sensors and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
its cut back considerably
but it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood
so it still remains city wide pretty high
are there any theories on why this is happening
i would say the majority of its happening during the day between probably $unc$ten in the morning and $unc$three in the afternoon
uh-huh
most
but why
why is it happening
most families are young
and both people are working
uh-huh
so theyre happening during the hours theyre gone from work
uh-huh
so i would say thats probably their prime motivation
theyll stock your house and look at your pattern and then go from there
so theyre professionals
they classify most of them as professionals
you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier just taking just junk items that they can just get $unc$ten to $unc$twenty bucks for real quick
uh-huh
probably the biggest items that you get in our neighborhood would be the high classed automobiles
the $unc$mercedes $unc$volvos things that they can get big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
uh-huh
guns that sort of stuff
very few penny ante stuff
what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime
the police force for $unc$one
i think they could definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
its
right now i think we are about $unc$thirty $unc$thousand people
and theres only $unc$eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and
but thats going to tend to
it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
in other words youve increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place
the
course in our particular state we have the prison overcrowding whatever
so theyre giving the early release
right
theyre doing that in our state too
yeah
and its
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences
but for the
so you think that would be a deterrent
that would certainly be a deterrent
uh-huh
and not necessarily give in to their human rights desires
if theyre overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate
what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
i think theyd have to go to extra measures to make sure a persons guilty in a lot of cases
course i know you cant be a $unc$hundred percent foolproof
right
so youd rather see it harder to convict somebody
id rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence to convict somebody
uh-huh
and then those convicted especially of murder and major crimes to reach the life sentences and death penalties and follow through with that
uh-huh
especially in the case of murder
right
i know in my case my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in $unc$eighty-five
wow
my goodness
and the individuals got caught
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
uh-huh
and $unc$two counts of kidnapping the $unc$forty-five to the head just the mental anguish and the whole $unc$nine yards the guy only got $unc$five years
uh-huh
right
wow
and he was out within $unc$two months because of the parole system
so what
did you sue him under the civil system
do what now
did you sue him under the civil system
no
im not real familiar with that
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him
oh
and
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him
and they said he has no job
he has nothing
theres nothing that he has that you could go after
yeah
makes you wish that still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing
yeah
very seld-
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt
yeah
they dont do that here
course they pay them
but you dont
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
yeah
thats too bad
and right now theyre reluctant to go after him because theyre repeat offenders
they been in jail before
uh-huh
uh-huh
theyve been released several times which is another deal i hate to see
uh-huh
uh-huh
but basically the guy commits $unc$three major crimes and car theft on top of it destroys my car
yeah
i think thats re-
yeah
yeah
and were out $unc$fifteen $unc$thousand dollars
and the guy gets out in $unc$two months
thats awful
and he goes out and commits it again
fact hes back in jail now
so what
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes
yeah
what deterrent does he really have
yeah
yeah
i think in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real possibility
uh-huh
weve had a couple break ins where the people have actually shot the people
my $unc$god
and return offenders have
theyve actually waited for them where theyve robbed particular neighborhood
theyll rob $unc$one house
then other people will wait up and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
right
course it doesnt always work out in their favor
right
but nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you cant arrest all of us
uh-huh
you can get some of us
right
you cant get all of us
uh-huh
and were beginning to see more and more of that
and thats a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake
yeah
here you break in
and youre going to get shot
yeah
thats certainly a possibility in
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
uh-huh
and it helps for a while
uh-huh
but then just another different set of people come in
and most of the people are transients from outside of the state
i would say probably $unc$eighty percent of them that are caught theyre from places like up in $unc$oklahoma and $unc$louisiana $unc$arkansas across the border
wow
so people who dont readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
uh-huh
its not many from the local communities
uh-huh
but its a problem
and i think that the court systems need to be stiffer in their penalties
yeah
would be a definite deterrent
and giving the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people
yeah
uh-huh
i tend to agree with you
i think what i would like to see is number $unc$one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes theres no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
right
and i think $unc$one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is if someone is found guilty of a felony level offense they lose their citizenship
and they lose their constitutional rights
uh-huh
and just a lot of things that were trying to worry about protecting these people from we just dont protect them
i know in my wifes case they made her feel like the criminal
i know
and i think thats ridiculous
they went to all
okay
have you painted something lately
yes
i have
that room i showed you
yeah
and then since then we have painted the bedroom
yeah
another bedroom
yeah
i showed you that one too didnt i
the brown one
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
the one that looks like a fudgesicle
yeah
yeah
heavens
i painted the outside of my house and $unc$one bathroom
yeah
but i have that problem with the ceiling the blown ceiling where you get around the edge
yeah
that is hard
i asked $unc$janice or somebody recently how you do that when you paint the ceilings where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with
uh-huh
uh-huh
how do you get the edge though
how do you get the edge
the straight edge
you just have to be real careful
i see
we use a $unc$two inch brush on a slant
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
but
are you going to paint the outside of your house too
yeah
i think i am going to do it this spring actually
really
yeah
there are $unc$six houses
the people that own the house they pay for anything like that that we do as far as the materials
nice
there are $unc$three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of $unc$six houses
yeah
so i am thinking i am going to change it to something
the brick is multi color mostly earth tones
uh-huh
that will be nice
or $unc$two tone
yeah
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too
uh-huh
what color did you paint your house
white
on the out
but i have a problem
i cant get up high
and we cant paint the chimney
you have got to get $unc$one of those ladders
we have $unc$one of those ladders
we are just not willing to get up that high
yeah
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house
and that is what he
i was out there last week
and he has finished everything except the chimney
we did too
we did it in the fall
and its just too high
it is really scary
and the only thing i would consider a professional maybe doing that
yeah
but it
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional
our house in $unc$new $unc$mexico it was stucco
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
yeah
and we did basically $unc$seventy-five percent of the house
and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
uh-huh
so i hired this man to come in and do it a young kid
uh-huh
and he came with his own raf-
what do you call those things
the blowers
no
those where you built a rafter thing
i know what you are talking about
yeah
scaffold
scaffold
thats it
he came and did it that way
and i think he charged me a $unc$hundred dollars to finish up
and literally i wouldnt have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus
its
yeah
and if he fell he was dead
and he knew that
so
my
so that was worth it getting a professional for that
yeah
plus he cleaned up my mess
i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
uh-huh
it wasnt too bad
you think
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside
shoot maybe a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty
yeah
since it is a $unc$one story
but we did $unc$two heavy coats over it
but then that way you are assured you did a good job than you are if you hire someone to do it
yeah
but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went i guess to buy his paint
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and yet he bought $unc$seventeen gallons
my word
and anyway when he checked out and he was using his charge card too they only charged him for $unc$one gallon of paint $unc$thirteen bucks or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
my word
and he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
uh-huh
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
uh-huh
so she had to start all over again
uh-huh
and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was $unc$thirteen $unc$ninety-nine or something
my word
and he saw
so that was really worth it painting his own house
yeah
it was over $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars worth of free stuff
my word
my word
he really saved in that way
yeah
but yeah
i think we are going to do another bathroom
but i think i will probably just do it in a roller
i want to do it about the same color and just be a little
rollers are so messy
we never any more
i know
but its the textured wall
a little paintbrush
