the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget
the only thing i do now is put the data into $unc$quicken
i dont know if you are familiar with that
yeah
i have some friends of mine who use $unc$quicken
and ive considered using it once myself
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
uh-huh
so i kind of gave up on the idea of using $unc$quicken at least for now
ive found its the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then not bother to total it
uh-huh
and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic
so it really helps with that
yeah
its similar problems
but we just have the $unc$one check book
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible
and occasionally we will get behind like you say
but it doesnt really seem to be too tight if we just remember to keep everything up to date and balanced
uh-huh
how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances
we havent had to until just recently
i guess weve got a daughter who is $unc$eighteen months and another $unc$one on the way
so we needed to start doing more of that just for saving for college and things like that
uh-huh
we try to put away $unc$two and $unc$four $unc$thousand a year just for that
yeah
thats pretty good if you can do that
i know
i have a daughter whos $unc$ten
and we havent really put much away for her college up to this point
but were to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college
uh-huh
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
and then the money that i will be making this summer well be putting away for the college fund
sounds good
yeah
i guess were just at the point
my wife worked until we had a family
and then now were just going on the $unc$one income
so its a lot more interesting trying to
uh-huh
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it
kind of enforce the savings
uh-huh
but it will be interesting to see
our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job almost full time
so its only recently that weve had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing
that sounds good
but i was just curious what part of the country
$unc$stockton
okay
how about you
$unc$cincinnati actually
i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with the western accents or something like that
i dont know how many people are getting involved in this
but thats interesting
uh-huh
i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by reading $unc$telecom $unc$digest
or was there another
a colleague of mine at work got some information over the computer network called $unc$internet
okay
yeah
that is how i got it as well
but
and he just forwarded that on to me
and it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in
uh-huh
so i sent back mail
yeah
it would be interesting to see how the data base
i guess were talking about the experiment
uh-huh
probably need to try to get back on the topic
but its hard to talk about finances without getting to dollar figures i guess
uh-huh
we could talk about some of the long range goals
and
what other long range goals do you have besides college
i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
uh-huh
i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that
it seems like every year my employer just gives back a little bit your tuition reimbursement
uh-huh
they use to reimburse $unc$one $unc$hundred percent
and now its reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
and its a real shame from what we had before because were
okay
what do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home
i think that it varies on the individual basis
sometimes there is no alternative
uh-huh
you do not have family available or family thats
you may not even have family who are around
thats true
yeah
so sometimes its not an alternative
but i think also sometimes it can be a benefit if its for a short time
sometimes in a nursing home
uh-huh
especially if its after an acute illness
to get over a
or to rehab after an illness
thats true
i never thought of that
yeah
sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time
thats true
until they get over that hump of whatever it is theyre dealing with
uh-huh
because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what theyre really able to
yes
they really are
they dont like to keep them longer than a week
so there is some good to it
yeah
sometimes too its used as a dumb job
the families do not necessarily know what to do with them
what do you mean
and they dont want to take the responsibility
so they will put them in a nursing home
yeah
thats true
so you see
theres both sides to it too
what do you think
yeah
and it depends on how sick the person is too what youre capable of if you have a family to take care of of your own
yeah
yeah
i would personally like it
if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help
thats not always possible
thats true
but to the best of my ability id like to do it until it gets impossible
i think thats also where youre going to have a lot of people who are going to
theres not a choice because its not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
right
uh-huh
yeah
so that option sometimes is not available if they do not have either medicare or insurance to cover it
thats true
yeah
but i think nursing homes can be good
it just depends on what kind they are
you need to check them out ahead of time
yeah
and then theres also some that are set up for specialties
uh-huh
i know some
unfortunately some elderly have i guess its alzheimers or where they wonder or confused or have some mental problem
uh-huh
yeah
that theyre
and you need a special nursing home for that
you need one that has a unit thats locked where they are not able to get out and roam around
yeah
and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
right
who know what theyre doing with that
yeah
so theres different types of nursing homes i think
yeah
my grandmothers not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it
and she really liked the idea of moving there
shes not ill yet
uh-huh
but she worked there as a volunteer for about $unc$ten years
and then she decided shes $unc$eighty $unc$five years old that eventually she doesnt want her family taking care of her and being a burden
shes very independent
so shes in this nursing home
its out in the country
and she really enjoys it right now because she doesnt have to wash dishes or cook
gives her a little bit of her own independence
uh-huh
but she still has a security there
right
some support
and then theres also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
so if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her
thats right
and ive seen some of them like that too
yeah
and also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active
uh-huh
yeah
sh-
so its not sort of like a sick place
uh-huh
no
she loves it
she has a great social life
and she travels
and its in the mountains
and its beautiful
and i hope that i have something like that when i get older
yeah
i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person whos going in and the family thats going to be effected by it
uh-huh
uh-huh
definitely its
and sometimes those choices can be made in advance
and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when theyre
right
i think that $unc$one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you dont convict someone who really shouldnt be convicted
definitely
and i think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that
i guess maybe $unc$one drawback of it is that if you have $unc$one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem that you wouldnt convict someone who maybe should be convicted
uh-huh
have you ever served on a jury before
i have twice
okay
it was a pretty wild experience
what sorts of cases were they
they were just small time cases where trailers and banks were involved
so were they criminal or civil
they were civil
they werent any criminal
okay
what was the verdict
did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
the jury let me see i think it was $unc$ten to $unc$one on the jury because they only had to have $unc$eleven people
yeah
so it was
they
and the one changed his vote at the end
so did it become
so it became unanimous after they turned it in
yeah
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
but it then became unanimous
but since it was a civil case it really didnt matter
you just needed a majority
right
what was the other case
that was also civil
the other case was just traffic
the
and it was seat belt law
yeah
and it didnt even hardly go through
didnt really even count
so
yeah
im a college student
so i havent been a jury eligible age for very long
yeah
and i did get $unc$one summons actually at $unc$one point
but i declined it which im able to do because im a student because it was a very bad time
yeah
you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
yeah i would like to do at some point
but i havent
$unc$one thing that i think maybe is a problem is i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesnt work as well
especially sort of
i wouldnt think that it does from what i experienced in them
wha-
it didnt turn out the way i planned it the way that i would think that it would go
you thought it turned out pretty well
yeah
but it was
jury was unorganized
and it just wasnt organized enough for me
yeah
im not used to it not being organized
and i just assumed that it would have been
so it was just kind of a zoo
and the jurors just sort of
someone had to figure out what was going on
thats about what it was
thats interesting
did it work out pretty well in the end
did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial
or
yeah
they picked $unc$one person
and then he finally moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
so it did end up working out pretty well
yeah
it ended up working all right
the $unc$one thing i sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe product liability or medical malpractice where theres sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
yes
its not just a matter of did this guy rip off this guy
and its just a matter of interpreting a contract
its sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues
and i wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion
i dont think that they educate them enough to really know whats going on
in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind
so
yeah
the bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was seemingly their property
yeah
it was on his property
so the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it
and he hadnt made the payments
right
so they came to get it
yeah
and then when they came to get it it was on the landlords property
and he wouldnt let them take it off
so they were suing to get it back
and it was a double wide
so theyd already taken it apart
so they left it there
yeah
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
so they were suing him for the money
and theres no way they could because it was the moving company
i get most of my news from newspapers really
i read the daily newspaper the $unc$houston $unc$chronicle
and sometimes ill read the $unc$wall $unc$street or the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times
i dont subscribe to either
but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it
how about you
do you mostly get things from t v or
yes
i actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks
however i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day
and i read the front page of the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal most every day
oh
thats interesting
you said computer networks
what sort
i am fairly knowledgeable of
$unc$dow $unc$jones for example cause the news wire
okay
thats interesting
and its picked up and actually available at my office
so its no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure
and its sort of by category
for example so i can read a certain business or topics
oh
i-
is it the $unc$a $unc$p news wire
or is it something that is a little bit different from that
its similar to that
but its $unc$dow $unc$jones which is the $unc$wall $unc$street journals news wire
okay
so thats interesting
okay
yeah
i had access in the past to the $unc$a $unc$p news wire
and i thought that was a pretty good way to get news
ive never used the $unc$dow $unc$jones news wire
but
yeah
it
do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach
actually not
i do follow
i dont know how to describe it
so ill say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense
its a weekly but not like $unc$business $unc$week or $unc$news $unc$week or $unc$one of those kinds of things
yeah
id like to say however that im overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
in what way
in sort of quality or sort of an orientation in terms of view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
i think that it has to do with
i personally think
i have a problem with their viewpoint
and i personally think theres a strong bias in the media
yeah
you wont offend me
so go ahead and say
yeah
like a liberal type of bias
yeah
absolutely
after all who writes
people who are journalist who are trained to write
and thats a liberal field at least from academia
yeah
and the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that im an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong
yeah
yeah
and it
they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
thats right
even if its not technical if its some social thing or whatever it doesnt matter
if i am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think im not expert in it
theyre telling me lies
yeah
yeah
by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
i think both
by deliberate i mean mistakes of omission or biased toward a particular liberal view point that they have
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
to give you an example we will go out of the printing media
i know of cases where we have $unc$one television media where they will show clippings from $unc$one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what theyre talking about is the same thing they are showing you which is sort of like a deliberate bias which is rather disturbing
thats disturbing
he does that
i havent really noticed them doing that
but whatever
again i dont watch t v news that much now
if i had access to $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n i would watch t v news more
but i dont usually
yeah
i dont have access either although i did at $unc$one time
and it was
i did during the $unc$gulf $unc$war
and it was addictive
yeah
did you think that the $unc$gulf $unc$war coverage would be kind of an abnormality
i just wonde- i guess
i would be curious to know what you thought as to how $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n t v news compared to the $unc$three networks
whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever
but i guess you wouldnt
you probably
if you just watched it during the $unc$gulf $unc$war that probably wouldnt tell you much
yeah
during that small sample i would think that everyone was just about the same except the $unc$three networks radio television programming
yeah
so if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n
yeah
and you
anyway
how about you
what do you do with your budget
what do i do
at the moment its under chaos
right now im just
i dont really have a budget $unc$per $unc$se
its called living within your means which means at the moment paying off the $unc$visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesnt collapse
uh-huh
yeah
thats true
but no
i dont really have a budget at the moment
but i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month
and then i usually dont exceed that unless the $unc$visa bill gets out of hand for $unc$one reason or another like if i have car expenses
and then it goes through the moon
so
yeah
thats sort of a problem
yeah
what do yo-
were trying to
so far we are in the clear credit wise
but the other side of it is
so not much on that side of it to add to it
were trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
but
so you can afford to get a house
yeah
wed like to do that some day
we have this dream
yeah
but we dont know how long it will be a dream
were real happy that we dont have any debt
but at the same time were real scared about incurring it in this economy right now
so were stepping real careful and trying to see whats the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month
yeah
what do you and your husband do
were missionaries actually
are you really
yeah
uh-huh
and it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota
and its cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
no kidding
and it doesnt get switched very easily once you come home
i see
overseas where would you be going
$unc$africa
$unc$nigeria
really
yeah
really
how long would you be there
about $unc$four years
were career
so we go over seas for $unc$four years
and then we come back for a year
we go over $unc$four
we come back for a year
with what church
were with $unc$wycliff $unc$bible $unc$translators
yes
yes
i know who they are
they have an office in $unc$costa $unc$mesa as i recall
yeah
they could very well
and
there was a fairly large building that belongs to them
are you active in translation
we will be
i was over $unc$four years doing language surveying which is the first step
youre kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need
uh-huh
and came home and got married
and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family
and it is easier to raise a family as translators
i always wanted to do translation
but as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak its easier
they really need surveyors cause youre free to travel anywhere
you dont have kids hanging around you and stuff
true
true enough
what languages do you speak besides $unc$english of course
i have a smattering of about $unc$ten different ones
but theres
im not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from $unc$one area to the other
since i did complete a survey in $unc$one area id switch to the other
uh-huh
so i know the greetings in about $unc$ten and how to do market stuff
but in about $unc$five i guess i can do better in it
and my french is pretty good
but its french
so im terrified to speak in $unc$france
in $unc$france
yeah
because theyre real snobby about their language
and french is street french
and i just picked it up off the street
and i knew what i was communicating
but i didnt know what i was saying
i never sat there and got a direct translation
and said something here when i came home and french to somebody
and he paled and said im not going to tell you what you said
so since then i have refrained from speaking any french
in
i dont know what i said to him
but i didnt ask him either
must have been terrible
the
was it $unc$henry $unc$macon said that the language was like a man slowly bleeding to death
so they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die
and it just amazes me that the $unc$french dont recognize that
free style english is just
takes on
guy
some of my things
id like to have a short work week
okay
and we need better health insurance and cau-
okay
we can start off there
lets just get started
okay
if you dont want to talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it
okay
okay
i just press $unc$one then
right
right
okay
ready
yep
okay
i think that a short work week is real nice
i have a $unc$thirty-seven hour work week
how about you
right now im just a student
i only work part time
but ive work in the job force before
uh-huh
and $unc$forty hours is just too long
you just dont have any time to do anything
it seems like $unc$saturday you get off
but $unc$sunday youre getting ready for $unc$monday
and if we could have a $unc$thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every $unc$four people we could give another job
uh-huh
right
and then that way everybody would have a $unc$three day holiday
and that would make a bigger market
wed have more recreation
people would have time to do it
there would be less of a stress level
wed have less crime
wed have to build less prisons less police force
yeah
it all makes sense to me
although there may be more crime if people have more leisure time
its not clear
and that
thats a possibility
yeah
$unc$one of the problems theyre facing now a lot of people now is that the small business cant offer health insurance
uh-huh
and its too costly
and what is happening is that theyre on a policy where they have $unc$x amount of users in it
so they get a specific rate
what happens is that if people start having chronic illness and things like that
what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for $unc$one particular
right
its called a group
what happens then is that they cancel because they just cant cancel an individual
so they have to cancel just life insurance
they have to cancel everything
uh-huh
what they do is that they cancel the insurance
and then all the people dont have any insurance coverage
right
but im satisfied with my job
im an engineering student
right
and i work for my instructor
and im not a typical student
im older
im in my thirties
yeah
and so i have a lot of job experience
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose
yeah
but in the same token its really enjoyable for me because i dont have to have nobody breathing down my back
and $unc$one of the things that i really hate about jobs i dont like bosses that want to yell at you and are down on your back and all this and that
uh-huh
i just really cant deal with that
yeah
what kind of jobs have you done
i do research in computer science
and ive just been doing that for a few years now
my job has most of the benefits i want
uh-huh
what i really like is i like being
they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as id like
but thats just nice a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
they also
a really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education
i get night courses that theyll cover right now
and thats really good
yeah
yeah
thats just great
you have what you might call knowledge power
right
when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that youre categorized
some people can be let go and replaced like say a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist
but if youre a person thats doing computer type things and you have the knowledge system youve revised and revamped the system then youre vital to the company
uh-huh
and you get more benefits
thats where im like
im into computers too
and thats $unc$one of the things that ive found in any $unc$one of these jobs and anything ive done is that to have knowledge
when you have the knowledge youre not going to be let go
be $unc$one of the last ones to let go anyway
right
what i
hello $unc$ann
hello $unc$chuck
the other day i attended a conference here at $unc$utah $unc$state $unc$university on recycling
uh-huh
and i was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a and lots of different places
uh-huh
and they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
i didnt think that was a new revelation
its not too new
right
what is the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a recommending now
they really didnt propose any solutions
the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the $unc$e $unc$p $unc$a
uh-huh
but he had a lot of facts to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down
and $unc$one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of news print
he was talking about the $unc$city of $unc$new $unc$york and how they went and collected all this news print
yeah
and they could sell it for a while
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling theyve collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
right
thats a common problem though
that has happened in $unc$dallas as well as $unc$new $unc$york
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldnt recycle it anymore which isnt good for business on the other end either i suppose
yeah
were doing some here in $unc$cash $unc$valley the community here
uh-huh
weve actually got a kind of a nice set up
weve got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that its not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
right
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
thats good
so $unc$one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it
right
there has to be a reuse for it
thats why they recycle
the $unc$one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers everything from waste baskets to carpet to the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
uh-huh
and i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
and theyre making clothes now that are recycled
like the recycled plastic $unc$coke bottles and milk cartons and things like that
and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from $unc$alabama
and he was kind of hired to do a study by $unc$two departments for the government
$unc$one was environmental protection
and the other $unc$one was i cant remember what
but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
uh-huh
and the solution that he came up with for plastics it was really quite amazing
he says the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them
really
he came to the conclusion plastics is actually $unc$one of the biggest problems in landfills cause its low weight but its high volume so it takes up a lot of space
right
and theres very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
its carbon
so that makes sense
a carbon fuel of some sort
but what about emissions
yeah
and its more than even paper or something like that
there is more energy in it per pound or whatever
he didnt deal with that
oh
he just said burn it
okay
he didnt talk about cleaning it up or anything like that
so its not very practical
no
its interesting
i bet that was a good day at the conference then
yeah
real interesting
did it change anything for you
not too much
i got a bit
actually
my feeling is that its really being used today
it really isnt doing any real good purpose for anything because its not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
right
i think ive seen some statistics that say that its more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life
right
because youve got all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
right
and it certainly doesnt seem to be a deterrent for $unc$one thing because its used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly dont think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible really care
thats
committing them mostly is either crimes of passion or at the moment
or they think theyre not going to get caught
or
right
its kind of like the aids phenomenon
im invulnerable
i dont need to care about this
im never going to get caught
yeah
yeah
but you also have to think whether its worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like $unc$jeffrey $unc$dahlmer
do you want
by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again
yeah
$unc$one way or another
whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility
yeah
but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life theres a chance that he might do things in prison and somehow redeem himself
yeah
i dont think he could ever redeem himself
but in some cases yes
so that
the other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent
there are cases where $unc$twenty $unc$thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops
im sorry
guess we killed the wrong guy
yeah
its
yeah
once youve made a decision that way its a little difficult to go back on it
right
you can apologize nicely
but i think the price
ive heard quotes its better that a $unc$thousand people go free than $unc$one person be unjustly imprisoned i think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works
yeah
yeah
its a-
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused
yeah
and i think that
and the way its being used now its like you listen to $unc$bush is
where are we going to impose d-
its like for drug dealers is the new big thing in
$unc$tsongas is also saying make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
right
and again i dont think these people care
they risk their lives every day
yeah
and they seem that the profit margins so high that the risk is almost not there
yeah
yeah
and especially now i live in $unc$massachusetts
were going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
yeah
but you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to $unc$texas or someplace that does its impossible to make a case that its affecting it in any way
yeah
i think its mainly people they get the vengeance of it
yeah
its also
because
i used to live in $unc$georgia
and the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed its very racially related and ethnically related
yeah
its lot of blacks
also a lot of young people
a $unc$sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what ive seen
right
and i think when you listen to the victims families and things theyre always talking about feeling justified or feeling like theyve gotten something out of it
my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldnt make any difference to the victims family
the only thing that should really
obviously if someone of mine who has close died id probably feel differently
but the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
right
right
and that
and also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we dont currently do this of making restitution
right
the
you will work your prison job
and any money you earn will go to the victims family
right
and the other thing is that i was reading through a book on human geneo research
uh-huh
and there more and more things like schizophrenia
and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
right
so if someday we can go to $unc$jeff $unc$dahlmer and say the problem is youve got an endorphin imbalance
and if you take this regularly youll be a sane and productive member of society
uh-huh
you really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions
yeah
i think on some of it you have to say someones responsible for his actions
i never liked the insanity defense
society made me do it
yeah
i
yeah
i did forget to ask you
what is your name by the way
im $unc$ann
youre $unc$ann
hi
but i
lot of interesting procedural things i think would be a good change if were going to be talking about the subject tonight which in some i guess criminal courts the
criminal courts
yes
yeah
the $unc$one of which was something thats been going on because of the $unc$rodney $unc$king trial here in town
and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race
really
yeah
the people that
the jury thats trying the officers in that case is an all white panel
uh-huh
and theres been a lot made in the local papers of that fact
i see
i cant
im a little surprised they didnt get a change of venue on that one
they have
they have
they moved it up to the county north of here
oh
its in $unc$ventura
and theres still quite a bit of publicity obviously
and its kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that
that videotape was just horrible
yeah
it was everywhere
yes
and i think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on
i agree with you
but i cant imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of or appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
exactly
the
im kind of torn on this issue
its like theyre saying on the $unc$one hand hes not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
but on the other hand its also saying that white jurors are not going to convict
right
theyre not going to do their job which is
the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or let go based on whether or not the evidence says that theres enough
exactly
based on fact
right
how interesting
oh
whats the prevailing thought within the community
you know what the news media is going to make of it
but what about the community
they
i guess it depends on who you talk to
i havent talked to a whole lot of black people on it
but i rather imagine theres some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic here we go again folks kind of stuff
uh-huh
my goodness
that cant be good for $unc$los $unc$angeles either
no
no
i
on the $unc$one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy
exactly
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like $unc$los $unc$angeles
youre going to have it just about anywhere
uh-huh
there
but thats interesting
yeah
what about the judge whos hearing the case
is he going to be impartial
is he going to be a good adjudicator
i dont know
and again theres something else along those lines
there was a girl out here named $unc$latausha $unc$harlins
i dont know if its got as much notoriety
but its rather almost as infamous here as it was with the $unc$rodney $unc$king problem
a girl walked into a $unc$korean owned store
and she had a dispute black girl
uh-huh
she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store
the owner of the store popped her
really
yeah
and of course they
the criminal case went up
and the judge gave the woman who shot the girl practically a suspended sentence
it was just
my goodness
she gave her no time in jail all of these things
and then we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge
to get that judge recalled i would think
yeah
yeah
thats almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences
yeah
it would make life easier
it would
yeah
but
the whole world would know what you were facing
and then its a matter of deciding
pretty good
pretty good
were talking about drug testing in the work place
drug testing in the work place
ive been tested a few times just before employment
but thats about it
ive never had random drug testing
yeah
we have random drug testing in my business
but ive never had to do it
really
yeah
yeah
they started that about a year ago
and i think its mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
uh-huh
but they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time
at least thats
they do with alcohol
pardon
they do it with alcohol
yeah
yeah
theyll check for alcohol
i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
no
once you start doing that stuff youre sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing
thats interesting
yeah
its a
what type of field of work are you in
im in the oil business
in the oil business
yeah
okay
and you work in the office around
yeah
i work in the office
so its pretty safe environment
uh-huh
yeah
i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we work around a lot of explosives
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on
yeah
so thats
im all for it because the type of environment i work in theyre working with explosives
and so they could blow up the whole
they have safety features with each of the explosives they use
but still it can be dangerous
yeah
yeah
i agree
i think that under certain circumstances especially when youre working in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people that you need to have that kind of stuff
yeah
if its
as long as its not abused random
as long as its random and the individuals rights are protected i dont have that big a problem with it
do they fire them or do they
this is it
this is where i start having my problems with my company
i work for a private company
and the policy is something like see if i can state this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then youre eligible for company counseling
uh-huh
uh-huh
but if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired
wow
so its sort of $unc$one of these little catch twenty-twos
thats
i think our policy is that
all right its probably the same thing
im not really sure what the
yeah
really
its $unc$one of those things that you read once
and then if youre not worried about it you just forget about it
thats right
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance
but im not sure if its if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
yeah
yeah
yeah
our companys a little tougher on the second chance
if theyre going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to go out of the way i think a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job
uh-huh
but when youre a private company the rules dont always apply
do you think it limits
its hard for me to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment
and its not
i guess i havent run into anybody thats been a problem
uh-huh
so i guess it works much shoot like any lottery
everybodys got an equal chance to get picked
uh-huh
id rather have that than say this week the $unc$a and $unc$b are going to be in
and next week $unc$c and $unc$d are going to come in
you could time it just right
yeah
right
right
i know $unc$one employee
i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath
and im not sure if our policy covers that or not
thatd be just as dangerous
yeah
especially around equipment machinery and stuff
thats true
ive gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
uh-huh
do they give any limits on alcohol
or is it
i dont remember to tell you the truth
i dont think they do
they must
gee whiz
that just shows you how much ive been paying attention
because i really dont know
ill have to go into work tomorrow and ask
oh
you can take some of that testing a little bit too far
there was a company in $unc$houston they did an unannounced drug sweep of their company
uh-huh
it was an unannounced sweep of
it was not only drugs
okay $unc$karen
youre first
okay
i was just going to say i think $unc$one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement not to get in a dead end job
uh-huh
and plus for me its medical and benefits and dental
okay
theyre also important
yeah
i guess $unc$one of the differences i see is working for a university there is room for advancement but not so much so in quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
so there is a progressive path
but not being in the commercial sector the motivation isnt there for a lot of people really
are they pretty much train for a specific job
and that what i hired for and then just very little variation from that
yeah
somewhat that
but then also there just isnt the ability to in $unc$one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances
uh-huh
so thats in our situation where we are dealing with an institution
its a little more difficult to recognize an individuals performance
uh-huh
and i suppose thats maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business
but i agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are $unc$one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment
thats interesting though
because i dont know if thats necessarily the case anymore
i use to think that after you work
you mean job security
job security
yes
that use to be i think a couple of years ago
but i dont know if it is so much anymore
in fact we just had a lay off in what $unc$november i guess
uh-huh
but it wasnt necessarily
some people had been there a long time
yeah
we are seeing that here as well
in some of the large oil companies there has been massive lay offs
uh-huh
i think its probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back thats what we do
uh-huh
uh-huh
no doubt
but
yeah
yeah
and institutionally like here at the university if there is a cut back its not where its needed
its where its most expedient which in $unc$one sense for us its where it makes the least noise which means its often the lowest support type roles
expedient
yeah
thats exactly it
yeah
where it cuts back the most
oh
oh
yeah
we
yeah
i think thats $unc$one of the things too
you get too many management people
its very easy
yeah
and its very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really arent aware of what all it took to get the work done
yeah
and then they wonder why it doesnt get done in the same amount of time
those people arent there anymore
right
because its support people that are providing the speed for it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
but
what else do you think is important
the
thats maybe the majority of the importance i guess
yeah
because my perspective is from an institution
there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
uh-huh
uh-huh
but if youre in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for i guess innovation
although the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
uh-huh
but i think its a long term type of process where in a small organization things can happen much more quickly
and so you can see the reward of the efforts
i think probably in a small
yeah
i was going to say its more personal for $unc$one thing
you probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere
right
probably where as in a bigger corporation i think youre just a number
yeah
you end up being your own person
uh-huh
and if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then thats their problem
and you really
uh-huh
whereas in a smaller
i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished
yeah
yeah
it becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves
uh-huh
hi
okay
with the issue of trial by jury i actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
yeah
i agree that thats an interesting thing
i believe for civil suits its not unanimous
but for criminal suits its unanimous by federal law
i dont know if its even true that its always unanimous because i thought there were cases i dont know if its the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it $unc$eleven out of $unc$twelve
yeah
i actually thought id read that too
and thats why i phrased it that way
yeah
i wonder
the difference could be that for if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote
and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal dont require
but i dont know what the laws
do you think that thats an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous
id be curious as to what the requirement for an acquittal is
and i dont think it would be wrong to say that $unc$eleven out of $unc$twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if $unc$six or $unc$seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal
but i dont know whether you need a unanimous vote of not guilty to acquit
yeah
that would be an interesting change
it was also allow the idea that if you had $unc$one person who was very disagreeable that it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because the principle is that the fact that its unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt criterion that it increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment
so i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
yeah
id agree with that
but ive never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although ive been out here and registered for i guess about $unc$five years
yeah
i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do
but
i would like to do that
ive been out here $unc$twenty some years
and ive been called $unc$three different times
but ive never actually even made it into the jury box because there have always been a number of people
oh
and ive never gotten up there to answer any of the questions
i
yeah
i also think that would be really good
i
the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is something like a $unc$nine $unc$three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that theyre right
uh-huh
and in fact im not sure that thats any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else
the $unc$one thing that i know does seem to happen from people ive talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where its $unc$nine to $unc$three or some such number that theres starts being a lot of peer pressure going on
uh-huh
and that peer pressure
and in some cases if its a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
yeah
id read $unc$one book i think it was calls trial by jury of all things that went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors based on the deliberations
uh-huh
some of them did say that when they were the only $unc$one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the $unc$one vote doesnt mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
yeah
i understand
you would hope that if you were in that situation that youd have the moral fortitude to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response
i think of the movie $unc$twelve angry men
uh-huh
you ever seen that movie
yeah
once
yeah
its exactly that situation where
its $unc$henry $unc$fonda
and its $unc$eleven to $unc$one
and hes the $unc$one
i believe he was opposed to the conviction
and he held on
and
okay
i guess were going to describe job benefits
and so what next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
i would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members
uh-huh
uh-huh
does your company have good benefits in that regard
yeah
i think
i work for a public school district
uh-huh
so its different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing
where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs
yeah
but overall ive been pleased with it over the years
uh-huh
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to change companies
or now were on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any
uh-huh
i see
how about yourself
im
my medical coverage is with an h m o
uh-huh
so in my opinion thats bordering on a health clinic
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage
right
yeah
our district did that for the $unc$ninety-one and the $unc$ninety calendar years
and i was in the h m o
and i was because my same doctor agreed to be in it for
they usually sign a contract or something
uh-huh
and i did have surgery last summer
and i paid $unc$ten dollars when i went to see him that first day
and ive never seen another bill
so i have to say it really works
right
but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it
if youve been going to a doctor for $unc$ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for those people
yes
thats right
yeah
im fairly young myself
ive only been
when i first started working which
$unc$three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
uh-huh
and at that time i immediately joined the h m o
and i never really
so the only doctor ive kind of consistently had has been through the h m o
and for me its worked out real good
yeah
right
but if you have a family and everybodys gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and just has all the medical history
and you feel comfortable with it
uh-huh
im sure it would be very stressful
and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay
you can continue to go to your own doctor
uh-huh
but your benefits are not as good
uh-huh
yeah
you mentioned you work for a school system
i work for $unc$georgia $unc$tech in the research branch
all right
and i guess another one that i rank up there high is the kind of job flexibility and time off i enjoy as a benefit
i do too
are you talking about spring break
and
right
right
yeah
getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
right
it really
i dont think most of our teachers
im not a teacher
i am a secretarial executive assistant
but i dont think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly
uh-huh
it is just $unc$texas has really
they want everybody educated no matter what it costs
and it would be just
we all look forward to
in $unc$two weeks we have spring break
and i dont know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff
uh-huh
right
what do you do there
im not actually on the teaching faculty
but we have a large research organization associated with the university
and thats who i work with
okay
and were given a good bit of flexibility in what we do
we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
thats good
yeah
i would think that that type of employment $unc$one day you might be really tuned in and the next day a little luke warm or something
right
and its good that they allow you that
right
it
as i say the schools
now we do have to work the day
but we do get many days off
and we all look forward to it
uh-huh
thats the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated from college
but at the time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs
yeah
uh-huh
and ive just continued to stay there
are there any things that youd like to see changed in terms of the benefits
okay
i guess it took
i guess the recording has started now
yeah
have you ever served on a jury
i served
i was in the $unc$air $unc$force and served on a court martial board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury
a lot of the same rules apply
have you ever served on one
yeah
i finally served on $unc$one last year
ive been voting for years
and i couldnt figure out why i hadnt been called yet
uh-huh
and i finally was
so it was an interesting experience
i was kind of boring
was it civil or criminal
it was municipal court
a grand jury or
uh-huh
so it was a combination of
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks
i see
so it was a combination of criminal and civil
and they had
most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors
uh-huh
and then it was always exciting when we got called to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury room
uh-huh
did the judge hand down sentences
or did you folks do that
yeah
the judge did
i had a hard time getting seated on a jury
i kept getting
id be questioned for empaneling the jury
and they kept dismissing me
uh-huh
course they dont have to give a reason
but its just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like
no
they want to get the best mix for their case
so they ask all kinds of wild questions
thats a science in itself
yeah
i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions
and i think part of it was they didnt like the fact that i dont drink any more
uh-huh
i see
because youd probably be too puritanical
and
yeah
that was probably it
although in my case i might have been more sympathetic with the person who got caught
i dont know
uh-huh
were the sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair
or would
if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
i was never there for any sentencing
i finally got empaneled on $unc$one case on my next to the last day
and we got into the jury room to decide the case
and there was $unc$one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didnt need to deliberate because hed already decided that the guy was not guilty
and he would never vote for guilty
so they appointed me jury foreman
and i didnt think that going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict
so i told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldnt get $unc$one member of the jury to deliberate
so the whole thing had to be tried over again
wow
i bet that made him happy
yeah
yeah
it was funny
the
i dont know
i didnt like not being able to deliberate
right
i wanted to vote guilty for the guy
and the other people were kind of mixed
uh-huh
the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again
cost him a lot of money
im sure
yeah
how many members were on the jury
was it a $unc$six or $unc$twelve member jury
it must have been $unc$six
uh-huh
yeah
thats kind of curious to me
i didnt realize until the $unc$wayne $unc$kennedy $unc$smith trial a few months ago that they had $unc$six member juries
i thought that it was always $unc$twelve men tried and true so to speak
but apparently for some crimes its permissible to have $unc$six people sit in judgment
i know on a
getting to this unanimous thing whether a jury should be unanimous or not in a court martial case it doesnt require the jury to be unanimous
its a simple majority rules
yeah
well lets see
is it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous
and
probably on capital
i dont know
we
the $unc$two that i were on had to do with drugs
uh-huh
and we were unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things
the government really failed to prove its case
and being fair to the person if the government doesnt prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by whats offered as proof
and we had to acquit him in both cases
it was too circumstantial
yeah
it was in some of the critical things like special investigations at $unc$one time in $unc$one of the cases had videotaped this person
but something happened to the camera and the tape and
all they could do was testify
do you ever think that theres a crime thats just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesnt deserve to live anymore
thats a good question
there was a point where i would have said no that no $unc$one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed
but since ive become a parent and since ive seen things like $unc$jeffrey $unc$dahlmer i really have to question that
i cant conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
uh-huh
and try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
of the statements made by people against the death penalty i like the statement made by $unc$cuomo
$unc$cuomo i believe is
hes governor of $unc$new $unc$york
but hes against the death penalty
but he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife
and thats
but even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things
its a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
right
exactly
and that was the thing that killed $unc$dukakis back $unc$four years ago when someone asked him a similar question
and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction
uh-huh
and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level
whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill
yeah
i think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a reason humane one
i dont think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do
are they reformatories where were trying to take people who cant survive or that arent conforming enough to society so that we work well together
or are they
is it a penal institution
is it designed for punishment
the death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where youre trying to punishment
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
but in theory it fits in
in a reformatory
if you put someone to death you obviously cant reform them
thats true
the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
and i really dont agree with that
i dont think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say i was about to kill and dismember this person
but if they catch me theyre going to kill me
so i better not do it
i just dont think that it works that way
yeah
i dont think its done
i dont think we run it as a deterrent
people say that
but if it was really a deterrent i think like horse thieves in the old west
they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while
uh-huh
and if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent i would think that it would be public
i dont think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it
if someone ever
if
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or something or shot by a firing squad or something like that
i would think youd make a bigger impact on their life rather than telling them that theres protestors out here at the
i dont know if that would really work that way or not
theres a lot of violence
i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in very specific examples such as transportation workers as in air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
i dont really think that its too many
i think its a severe invasion of somebodys privacy to say were going to look at your urine and then decide whether youre worthy of working for us
i really dont see that thats a very valid thing for a company to say
and personally i dont think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of whats inside my body
yeah
i guess i basically agree that
do you think its okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that theyll take drugs
suppose they found out some other way
i think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
yeah
theres too many cases where it can
there can be false positive results and that sort of thing
i dont think theres any definitive
okay this person is taking drugs
so we dont want him here
yeah
like i said some industries though i think itd be very necessary
i wouldnt want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when im flying in an airplane
yeah
but i find it to be pretty offensive that its such a big deal
if your employers not going to trust you
or it
i think its a whole trust issue
i just cant see it
but have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested
or
yeah
i have been
yeah
i was very offended by the whole process
i once too
yeah
its very humiliating
and im not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs
but i am totally against that sort of a
its a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before im going to talk to you
yeah
i had it during a job interview
and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this
right
and im just like im not even going to think much about it if youre going to treat me with this much respect even before youve gotten to know me
yeah
right
right
thats basically my opinion on it right there is that its just
i was in the same sort of situation as
it was a job interview
and then you had a physical where you were drug tested
and its
i just
and i know people who have been drug tested and who have not been hired by a corporation which
i really
the other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy its my bodily fluid
and i dont really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that
uh-huh
just to the fact that i dont know that it is a companys business to regulate what its employees are doing when theyre not at work
i mean during the $unc$eight hours during the day when theyre supposed to be there i think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not
but when it enters into what theyre doing when theyre not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also
yeah
like you say if its not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
right
right
and if you are doing drugs and its causing a problem then theyll notice it for other reasons
thats exactly right
yeah
and also i just think it gets a lot
im a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies
and i think that it just moves down along a line that i really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees lives outside of work
theres already talk of people
were not going to hire you if you smoke
i can see how they can say in the work place you dont want them to smoke
but when somebody leaves work i dont think that its the employers right to regulate their life style at all
do you think its should be illegal for an employer to do this
or
i really think it should be except as ive mentioned twice now in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where its just vital that a person is clear minded at all times
yeah
and other than that i do not think it should be allowable
i think it should be illegal for them to want to do that
its kind of the big brother syndrome
i just
anything like that just kind of scares me
i tend to view it
even though i dont think id work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employers rights in addition to an individuals rights
but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
right
and if they say they dont want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
right
and i dont really
okay
okay
i thought it was supposed to give a recording
but anyway i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me
and i embarrassed to say its pretty trivial
uh-huh
all i do is keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every $unc$two or $unc$three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month
but i doubt i do it more than $unc$three times a year
uh-huh
do you use a computer
and
no
i work with them all day
im in computer science
yet i do everything on paper
oh
uh-huh
i dont even use a calculator for the stuff im doing because its all pretty round numbers
yeah
mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when he was a $unc$marine
he went to $unc$saudi $unc$arabia
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off
so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance
uh-huh
so they come in
i pay them
and thats it
thats about the extent of it
yeah
that
i dont really have this major budget or anything
im real thrifty
i take care of $unc$two children and me and just real careful with the money what little we have
uh-huh
thats what i do
yes
its pretty straightforward
its almo-
i cant imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making fancy budgets
no
it seems like if youre getting to that level youre not in real good control
uh-uh
ive never liked credit cards and a lot of debt
uh-huh
you buy something on credit
uh-huh
and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
yeah
i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way its a record of everything
uh-huh
and i dont have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month
i dont have too many weaknesses
but i found out a credit card was $unc$one of them
its so much easier if somethings on sale if youre a woman and youre a sale person
its like its on sale
lets go grab it
and if you dont have the money then use a credit card
so i got rid of them credit cards
yeah i guess if thats a weakness thats a good thing to do
yeah
that was my weakness
it wasnt bad
i didnt have thousands of dollars and like that
i just learned that that wasnt for me
uh-huh
sure
but i self-employed
i have my own little cleaning business type thing
so i keep
do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that
or
no
its not hard
i just keep it in a notebook and write down what ive made and what its going to have to go for that month
and its not that hard not at all
uh-huh
thats good to know
i always do my own income tax
yeah
do you
i dont understand the idea of paying somebody to do it
it seems like its absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it
r-
all you got to do is read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go
i
yeah
just the form
yeah
it seems absurd that people will pay some bucks just to get someone to
yeah
and a lot of them
its dumb
i guess if you had some really complicated stuff
but i dont
so i dont mess with it
yeah
but i dont use a calculator either
i dont trust myself with using a calculator or computer too much stuff like that because i want to make sure that i keep on top of the numbers and understand whats going on
i dont have that many things to add up
so
i know too many people who use a calculator
if they make a mistake they find out $unc$two months later because they werent paying attention
yeah
and it seem
and we have a
i bank at $unc$n $unc$c $unc$n $unc$b here
and they have a number that you can call in
and i always call in once every other week or so
and i will check off what checks have cleared
and
yeah
do you do that
we have the same thing
you do too
yeah
and i always check them off and check my balance and my book because i always want to know exactly what i have
sure
i do that real often
i do that
okay
what are your views on capital punishment
i have ambivalent feelings because i dont think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is
but on the other hand it is very expensive to maintain
$unc$texas has $unc$one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
yes
and its eating us alive budget wise
and
are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state
yes
we do practice capital punishment
but the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that its a very long haul before anybodys ever executed
yes
thats similar to $unc$georgia
yeah
and then i was reading in the paper just this morning its interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them because of all the costs of the appeals and all that
thats probably true considering
yes
yes
i guess in a way that it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if
i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people who would see it
yes
right
that would be the intent of it
yeah
but im not sure how successful that is
i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there werent so many appeals
quicker maybe
yeah
yeah
if the person whos going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
uh-huh
what kind of work do you do
im a research engineer
i work with $unc$georgia $unc$tech
im a school principal
elementary school
yes
and in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo kids
and i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
and im afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that
course you couldnt do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
uh-huh
but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids
wed have fewer decisions to make down the road
thats probably true
but i guess theres other factors that
yeah
but pumping more money into the school system is a good thing
im not talking about just in the school system
but its not going to
i see
im talking about
in
im afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared
i know the institutions dont work that well
but its a bad day because i get all these kids through my office
i have a school of $unc$five $unc$hundred and $unc$thirty-seven kids
uh-huh
$unc$five $unc$hundred of them are good solid kids
and i have the same $unc$thirty-seven in my office every day
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible
some of them in the penal system
so thats a difficult situation
and you just see those kids going down the road
not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment
but some of them have already been in youth centers and that kind of thing
and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals
and im not talking about necessarily in the school system
im not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
uh-huh
i think thats $unc$one reason we have problems in schools
and some of them are our problems
but a lot of its because everything society wants we are supposed to do
uh-huh
but thats another subject
but
thats probably true
w-
i dealt with $unc$two or $unc$three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them
yeah
i guess thats not an easy solution
theres no easy solution for that
uh-huh
i dont know that there is an easy solution
but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and im not sure what it would be it would be money better spent than
uh-huh
do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to $unc$harvard
thats true
im sure it is
yeah
statistically thats true
yeah
i dont
certainly capital punishment isnt going to solve a lot of problems
uh-huh
but
are you for it
im for it in some cases
i guess i am for certain cri-
yeah
yeah
in certain crimes
what kind of crimes would you use it for
premeditated murder crimes of that nature i think should definitely
uh-huh
any mass murderer type individual
i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going not $unc$one instance but perpetual abusers of children
uh-huh
you always have castration
somebody elected that recently
yes
i read about that
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it
uh-huh
but
okay
i used to work in a day care center
uh-huh
i worked in all the different areas of the day care center
and they can be deceiving to people
i did not work there long because i couldnt handle the treatment that the children got
and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in $unc$tyler who had $unc$two or $unc$three centers all over the city
uh-huh
and they would be $unc$one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
yeah
i think if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when theyre not expecting it
yeah
because they do things differently when youre not around
so
that
i know wh-
the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have and how many kids they have and how they break it up
uh-huh
right
because we had $unc$one that sounds kind of like what you were in
uh-huh
it was a really good one
and in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered
my wife did artwork for them
so we got our day care free
uh-huh
but they didnt have enough teachers
and
this $unc$one was set up good
they had $unc$two teachers to every room sometimes $unc$three
uh-huh
and they had a good system so when you walked in everything looks cool
uh-huh
the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough
they did not show them care to these small children who are being left
uh-huh
they
$unc$one time i picked up this little boy who was crying
and the owner came and just chewed me up $unc$one side down the other
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
and i said no
this child was crying and needed some comfort
yeah
what is your problem
did they separate them by age group
yes
because i think thats $unc$one thing that was important
right
they had the babies that didnt walk in $unc$one room the ones that were starting to walk in $unc$one room
uh-huh
then they had the $unc$three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives just like that
yeah
they really did separate them well
it sound
yeah
it was just the teachers themselves
right
but
yeah
that theyre not
affectionate people that theyre may be parents themselves or something
yeah
their system
right
but their system was great
but the caring just wasnt there
uh-huh
the $unc$one woman that did the babies i worked with her
and she was fabulous
uh-huh
she loved them babies
and she loved them and cared for them
but every $unc$one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck
yeah
i think thats probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and $unc$p $unc$h ds and all that kind of thing and know all the technical stuff
but if they dont reach out and touch the kids then that doesnt do any good
yeah
these kids are just in a day care center all day and with any type of emotional getting care
yeah
theyre just there going through this routine which is lousy
yeah
an-
the other group that we had was kind of interesting
the other $unc$one we went to it was a husband and wife team
uh-huh
and we knew them from other associations
but it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict $unc$one
and i think shed put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff
but he was actually the more demonstrative type the more loving
uh-huh
he would laugh with the kids and play with the kids
and it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it
uh-huh
an-
yeah
you dont see that much
yeah
so they had a really nice balance
we liked that $unc$one
in fact it was called $unc$humpty $unc$dumpty $unc$play $unc$school or something
thats cute
but they also did some of the teaching things
and then they had
obedience was important
yeah
that has to be with a day care center
so i think they used the
you probably heard where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
ive never heard of that
thats a new one on me
and its $unc$one
i cant remember what they call it actually
but you just stand them in front of a clock
and it has a second-hand that goes around
uh-huh
and they have to stand there
okay $unc$chuck do you have any pets there at your home
yeah i do
and what kind do you have
ive got a male $unc$siamese about a year old here
i live alone in an apartment except for the cat
uh-huh
uh-huh
how about you
we have a cat
hes probably a good $unc$two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
uh-huh
hows the disposition of your siamese cat
its theyre just aggressive by nature
uh-huh
and hes been neutered and declawed
so hes an indoor cat
uh-huh
so that kind of calms him down for the most part
how about yours
yeah
he has been really aggressive especially towards my little girl for some reason
hes been so mean to her
and you say youve had him how long
weve had him for about $unc$two years
$unc$two years
and he was so mean to her right after we first got him
we had him neutered and declawed
and now he bites her
he cant scratch her any more
he bites her
does he bite her enough to draw blood
yeah
yeah
he has a couple of times
so
uh-huh
but hes a very possessive cat
he loves my son
its his cat
and hes the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
yeah
and hes so funny
he just follows my son around just like a dog
he wont even let my son shower
yeah
he meows and wants to get in the bathroom
and while he showers its so hilarious
so hes quite a animal
yeah
boy
i guess
as long as he doesnt get too aggressive i guess with the daughter hes all right
yeah
you wouldnt want him to carry her off or something
yeah
we did actually take him to the pound a couple of times because we just couldnt have him being so aggressive towards the girl
uh-huh
sure
but he seems to have mellowed out a little bit
and we do keep our daughter away from him
so
yeah
yeah
were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house
is that the only pet that you have
it is
uh-huh
we tried a dog about $unc$four years ago and we ended up with $unc$malamute and some other kind of mix
anyway it ended up being just a huge dog that ate us out of house and home
so we gave him up and tried
do you live in a house or a place where you
yes
uh-huh
were in a house
but were in a subdivision where we really cant allow the dog
i see
we couldnt allow him to run free
so he was just chained up all the time
and it was unfortunate
sure
have you tried any other pets
no
no
i live alone in an apartment
and its not that big that
although ive heard rabbits are pretty good
oh
i saw something on $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses
uh-huh
my word
and they apparently
especially when theyre young when they bring them in
my word
and do they just paper train it or something
i guess
i guess
yeah
and i would imagine that they dont have many more than $unc$one to start with either
yeah
rabbits are darling
that would be fun if you could get them trained
otherwise theyre pretty smelly
yep
thats right
did you see the dog show
huh-uh
we dont have cable
i see
they have they call it the $unc$westminster $unc$dog $unc$show
i think its in $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city at the gardens
there once a year live
and they had that on last week
and thats really kind of something to watch
its on i think $unc$two or $unc$three nights for maybe an hour or $unc$two
is that right
and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there
some of them are really beautiful too
uh-huh
id be interesting to watch
you live in $unc$utah do you
yes
uh-huh
$unc$elton
goodness
we live out here its by $unc$ogden
its north of $unc$salt $unc$lake $unc$city $unc$utah
uh-huh
and we really love it out here
its kind of country
were only about $unc$ten minutes from $unc$ogden
uh-huh
so were kind of country but not too
do you all work for $unc$t $unc$i or for
no
huh-uh
do you
yeah
yeah
yeah
see im getting so many calls to $unc$texas
this is the very first one ive talked to
great
yeah
ive been doing it for about $unc$two weeks
and no my
uh-huh
how do you get most of your current event information
see im going to school right now
and while im working i dont get a chance to read the paper a lot
uh-huh
and i dont watch t v as much really either because my free time is kind of
and i do other stuff with it
right
while im at work sometimes on the computer network i read the news sometimes
uh-huh
and thats kind of helpful
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things
you keep up on whats going on
thats true
my roommates and stuff people around me talk about it
yeah
and the people i work with are pretty up-to-date on that kind of stuff
so
right
im a housewife
i have $unc$three kids
and so i get most of my information probably through just the news at $unc$six oclock and then talking with people and just hearing whats going on
uh-huh
yeah
do you watch major network news
or do you watch the $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer hour
just channel $unc$eight
really
thats our channel here
thats the eyewitness news
uh-huh
see where i am channel eights public t v
so its kind of different
uh-huh
yeah
i think a lot of the commentators on the major networks right its kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on
but it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news
right
and i think even in the elections they choose who theyre going to follow and who theyre not
and basically if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will kind of publicize his name
yeah
yeah
exactly
i dont think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it
i think you get a very lopsided picture of whats going on
uh-huh
because they can only report on
they give each candidate perhaps $unc$ten second blurbs in which to say you just cant get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it
right
right
and the news too it just doesnt cover that many stories
it just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff
yeah
but other than that you really dont know whats going on
yeah
i will read our current letters that come out on elections
and i guess i do read that
and i do study whos running in our area
and i do study whats going on in the economy
it
and i guess i do read other magazines too to get my information
what kind of see
i subscribe to $unc$science $unc$news
and thats real good because it gives a brief summary of or the updates of whats going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that i wouldnt know about
right
but other than that i dont really read
i dont really subscribe to anything else
i used to read every month a readers $unc$digest
uh-huh
but now i guess i just have friends that clip articles
or if i am interested in something of course when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on
yeah
but a lot of the times i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper
but i just cant seem to find the time
yeah
if they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
yeah
but
i remember back during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on because they were going constantly with that stuff
right
but
they even did a story on our news here in $unc$texas on what people wanted to see more of
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of $unc$texas news
we just dont want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in $unc$dallas
yeah
that we want to hear whats going on with the economy whats being done to help it whats going on in other countries whats just more information
if they reported every violent crime in $unc$atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour
yeah
but
i guess well get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the summer olympics
yeah
thats
already theyre having
in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on the $unc$olympics
and theyve got a countdown
its like $unc$sixteen $unc$hundred days or something
i know were trying to get tickets to it right now
really
yeah
thats going to be crazy that time of year here
but
yeah
i cant believe
theyre stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over
i guess people want to hear about it
also big in the news right now is the $unc$braves because theyre in spring training or whatever
right
right
and they did so well last year
yeah
thats another thing they spend a long time on sports
and i think thats fine i would like to see more time spent on other things
yeah
but
it seems like
i dont know
they way they do the newscasts i wish they kind of separated it
if you wanted to watch $unc$one thing you could turn to some channel for it
but i dont have cable
$unc$dave
what kind of pets do you have
we have $unc$one rotten cat
$unc$one rotten cat
yeah
its my sons cat
i heard a laugh in the background
yeah
thats the boys
they know i dont like it
dont you like cats
i like cats
this cat is more like a dog
yeah
yeah
hes a $unc$one owner
he likes $unc$one boy in the family and thats about it
thats odd
how does he treat the other people
just stays away or runs usually
wow
but hell follow my oldest son around
when he is in the house he will come up and hell jump on his lap
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever hell just kind of look at them like what are doing
did he raise him or something
we bought the cat for him
and so hes been the one that you know spent the most time with him
but ive never owned a cat like that
ive had cats growing up all the time
and they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
uh-huh
thats interesting
so its a weird cat
we have a mutt
a mutt
we named it $unc$hooper because thats where we got it from
uh-huh
some lady she
a lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house
oh
and she use to work for a veterinarian
so she would neuter them give them all their shots
uh-huh
and we saw an ad saying it was free
so we went down there and picked it up
and its been an excellent dog
but its my first dog ive had
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work
uh-huh
so thats mostly why we got it to keep her company while i am away at work
is that kind of your child right now
yeah
right now it is
you feel like
its kind of good training
we have been trying for kids
but right now we havent had any
uh-huh
but its pretty good training i think really keeps her on her toes
have you had dogs before
my brother has
we didnt do a lot with them
i never felt like it was mine or anything
you couldnt do anything
uh-huh
but that did more responsibility when its yours and not your brothers
yeah
but
weve
when i was growing up we always had a dog
and we had mostly mutts
not mutts but mixes like $unc$one or $unc$two mix
uh-huh
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
thats what we found
ours is a $unc$cockapoo
uh-huh
i think its half $unc$cocker $unc$spaniel and half $unc$poodle
uh-huh
but its a really good dog
yeah
i dont know
they seem listen better or something
uh-huh
is your cat a purebred
no
no
its just an accident
from my sons friend down the street
their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
uh-huh
so
would you ever want a dog in the family
i would
we had a dog that was a mix between an $unc$alaska $unc$malamute and a $unc$labrador
uh-huh
and i should say a pup
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him
yeah
and when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was a pet
and it was a dog that we gotten
and he was just too big
uh-huh
the kids couldnt handle him
and i was still going to school
and my wife was working
and i was working
and so we just didnt have time to really train him
so he was too big for the kids to handle
so he was just tied up to a post
yeah
so we gave him to
i dont know if youve
there is a place out here called $unc$shorties $unc$lane out here in $unc$harrisville
uh-huh
and they have
i guess its kind of an animal shelter
but he just takes a few the animals in
and some he destroys
and some he keeps
uh-huh
so we took him up there
and he ended up keeping him
cause he has had him for $unc$six or $unc$seven years
weve saw him just about a year ago
and i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away
uh-huh
and so we asked him about it $unc$one day
and he said yeah
hes been the best dog ive ever had in my life
wow
just goes everywhere with him
he would have been a great great dog
he just needed a lot of time
uh-huh
hey $unc$steve
they just started a recycling program here i think
this is my first experience with recycling program
but instead of just tossing everything away which i always felt bad about i am starting to split stuff up
the only disadvantage is that they dont pick it up at the curb
they make me drive it a mile down the road and spit it out down there
what are they doing up there
here in $unc$saskatoon much the same thing
there is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products
were in a community of about $unc$one $unc$hundred and $unc$eighty $unc$thousand people
there are areas where we could
actually we have a couple of the handicapped societies types of places where the $unc$one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers
so we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing
and then theres a deposit program on plastic and glass containers primarily soft drink bottles
and so we are able to take it to $unc$one of the rehabilitation centers
and then they recycle the containers
they refund the deposit which is anywhere from $unc$five to $unc$fifteen cents a container
and then
the deposits only on drink stuff
right
okay
primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing
okay
so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers
we do have $unc$one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
okay
there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler with the handicapped group will also accept those
so its fairly extensive
but then again its the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
did they
are you giving these products to the handicapped group
and the handicapped group is getting the money
or are some home distributing the funds back to you
theres the opportunity for both
okay
generally the handicapped group takes care of the things that
actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well
thats very cool
i heard about a similar program in $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city where a thing called $unc$homeless $unc$incorporated or something like that
but what they do is employ i think mostly men but homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans
and i think its mostly cans
there may be bottles as well but beer cans soda cans and what not
and they bring them up to $unc$one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it
yeah
i guess partly because of our climate
here in $unc$saskatoon at least the majority of central
i want to say $unc$central $unc$canada
but $unc$central $unc$canada tends to referred more to $unc$ontario and $unc$quebec
yeah
but we dont have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing
theres psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes
do they do it with news papers as well
they have done it some
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers
they are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers the shopping malls
there are several containers where the group called $unc$cosmopolitan $unc$industries collects
or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
and then the bins are collected
some of the
$unc$jimmy how do you get most of your news
i watch the national news every day for $unc$one
i also read $unc$one or $unc$two papers a day
and im pretty much a news junkie
and i tune in to $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n a lot
wow
when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
every evening at $unc$six $unc$thirty i believe
i watch the national news
okay
i would probably be a junkie or watch $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n a lot
but i dont subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also because
uh-huh
i give to the $unc$united $unc$way
and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
uh-huh
as opposed to paying for cable
yeah
i take away a addiction
something
yeah
i
overall i
the quality of the news you get off of most sources i would say is pretty low
its
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage
and thats $unc$one of the reasons why i try and get as many sources as possible
because if you hear the same story from $unc$three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on you would hope
but still hard to say that what youve heard is what really is
what newspapers do you read
i read the local newspaper
and i also try and read $unc$one of the major dailies like the $unc$chicago $unc$tribune or the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times or something like that
uh-huh
for a while there i subscribed to $unc$new $unc$york $unc$times actually a couple of newspapers because my fiance
she was unemployed for a while
so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads
uh-huh
and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news
right
and i dont know
$unc$new $unc$york $unc$times is okay
and when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last $unc$ten years or so
but they say its like the sixth grade reading level
uh-huh
but i swear its at least second or third grade sometimes
right
pretty low
but i dont know
i think if you listen to $unc$n $unc$p $unc$r or something like
right
i really like $unc$n $unc$p $unc$r a lot
thats pretty good
and i like listening to that on
when i get a chance when im in the car a long enough time to listen to it because i
right
yeah
i $unc$n $unc$p $unc$r a lot also
i really like them because they give
instead of being as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a $unc$five minute blurb or a $unc$ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
and they also
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
$unc$mcneil and $unc$lehrer
i guess hes leaving
$unc$one of them is leaving
uh-huh
theyre pretty good too
i guess a year ago youre probably watching $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n a lot right
right
yeah
had that invasion or whatever it is
sure was
but i dont know
i guess its still a lot of hype
look at the $unc$smith trial
uh-huh
that was a joke
yeah
that was
but then you also have things where they broadcast the $unc$clarence $unc$thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was really good
yeah
the $unc$n $unc$p $unc$r doing that
yeah
i know
i had some visitor
and he was just i dont know fixated on that just listened to it constantly
uh-uh
and i guess thats good when its live if youll really want that
but thats not really providing you news
right
its more like a media event rather than reporting
but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something thats good also about $unc$c $unc$span which i tune into every once in a while
really
thats kind of boring to me i think
yeah
it is really kind of boring
but thats
if you dont watch it there then youre going to hear somebody elses canned report somebody elses view about it
and thats what youre supposed to
if you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which i would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone elses
yeah
yeah
i guess thats true
but $unc$one of the ways that i get information is every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this thing
its free inside the company
its called $unc$intellect
and they basically type out abstracts which are really literally
ive actually read the actual articles
theyre pretty g-
lets see
mines pretty easy actually
i just got done reading a couple magazine articles about the new $unc$saturns
uh-huh
and although i cant afford it right now i would just love to have one
really
you like
so youre an $unc$american
you want to buy $unc$american
no
regardless of that fact
its the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money
im interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing
and it seems to just blow the competition away
it terms of handling acceleration
handling power everything
yeah
it just got the top rating
it was compared up against
lets see
there was the $unc$mazda $unc$m $unc$x $unc$three nissans whatever their $unc$n $unc$x $unc$two $unc$thousand the $unc$civic $unc$s $unc$i
and it dominated over all of them
all the raters loved it
i like the styling
and i seen a few of them actually race
and they seem to be really good cars for it
what about $unc$mustang $unc$g $unc$t
$unc$mustang $unc$g $unc$t
cant afford it
those
so youre talking about ones in a lower end price range
right
yeah
im a graduate student
and lets face it
i dont make any money
so
right
you can wait till you graduate
and youll have plenty of money
you can buy whatever you want
yeah
yeah
well see then
yeah
right now im stuck
ive got a $unc$pontiac $unc$sunbird $unc$turbo that
its fast but unreliable
and trying to get it prepared for racing
but it would be nice just scrap it and go for the $unc$saturn
right
would you use that for city driving and racing
yeah
id use it for both
the nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both
autocrossing is
what kind of track is that
just like a set up a lot of times
and its like really large parking lots and pylons and things
okay
and you set up the track pylons
okay
tight turns hard acceleration
ive seen a lot of $unc$mustangs compete
and its interesting
they get dominated by the $unc$corvettes that are also in their class
really
yeah
yeah
i would guess so
what are you thinking about buying
i think id like to get $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w if i go the german route which im kind of leaning towards right now or maybe a $unc$acura $unc$legend
the $unc$legend
a $unc$lexus $unc$s $unc$c $unc$three $unc$hundred maybe something on that order
uh-huh
yeah
because your $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w your german cars have good reputations i think
yeah
i was actually in
a lot of the $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w are produced in $unc$stutgardt and $unc$munich
yes
and i was there this summer
and i was really impressed by the factory tours and such for $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w
the
yeah
they have the whole philosophy
they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking theyre better which is kind of hard to take
yeah
as youre walking through that little tour in $unc$munich its kind of theyre trying to brainwash you too
of course
of course they are
they want you to buy their car
yeah
there
it was interesting
i also went to the $unc$porsche
and it was amazing how they were completely opposed
really
yeah
the $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w is really like we have all these high tech things
and everything is put together with exacting tolerances
and then you go to $unc$porsche
and its like these cars are completely handmade
and no $unc$two of them are alike
and
yeah
thats
so its like completely opposed
i dont know
which do i like better
i think i like the porsches philosophy a little bit better although its not really practical
no
its not realistic
unless its a toy
yeah
if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess
lets face it
yeah
yeah
but $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w good for that
what kind of driving just like commuting youd want to use it for
yeah
just work
short trips
no heavy mileage
im putting on less than $unc$fifteen $unc$thousand miles a year
wow yeah
so its pretty minimal
thats cool
lasts a long time
thats mainly what im looking for
yeah
thats good
i was impressed by the $unc$mercedes too
yeah
i really like the $unc$mercedes
but if you have a problem with a $unc$mercedes you take it into a shop theyre going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
the factory was nice
and
and is it different for the $unc$b $unc$m $unc$w
i think something on the order of a $unc$three series its probably different
once you get up in the $unc$five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly
probably
right
i can imagine that
so im kind
yeah
im not sure if i really want
all right
yes
okay
how many kids do you have
i think were going to talk about parents spending time with their children
we have $unc$three children who are $unc$eleven $unc$nine and $unc$eight
right
so this is the big issue with us although i dont recall marking it on my little things to talk about
but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time
and
uh-huh
anyway
you dont have children
no
but youre married
yeah
weve been married for $unc$two and a half years
weve been trying for about $unc$two years but no luck yet
oh
hopefully
i know were not supposed to do this long distance
but im getting a call
i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting
could i ask you to hold $unc$one minute
uh-huh
ill be right back
excuse me just a moment
had-
theyre going to get mad
she had another call
she has just $unc$three kids $unc$eleven $unc$nine and $unc$eight
hello
uh-huh
im so sorry
all right
that was my daughters $unc$brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow $unc$brownie meeting
okay
that keeps you bu-
do you have a lot of activities with your kids
i dont want this to be a unilateral conversation
but yes
we do
both my husband and i work
and our children are sixth fourth and third grade
and the school years are wonderful
theyre just wonderful
uh-huh
the kids they are real people
and they are interesting
and they have all their own activities
and i think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation
our children have not yet decided to rebel
uh-huh
so theyre pretty good kids huh
im sure thats coming though
but they are wonderful kids
yeah
we had ni- wh- growing up
i guess i can talk about us
we had $unc$nine kids in our family
we had $unc$eight boys and $unc$one girl
but my $unc$dad
you had $unc$eight boys and $unc$one girl
yeah
and the time that we spent with our dad was he owned his own business
so we worked with him most of the time
so thats how we spent most of the time with him
are you $unc$mormons
yeah
thats what the $unc$utah and the large family
that was a dead giveaway huh
were $unc$catholics
i came from a family of $unc$five
i had $unc$four brothers
uh-huh
the only girl
oh
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
that
i never felt spoiled
in fact i always thought my toys were destroyed
i was going to say my sister wasnt spoiled very much
no
usually busy fighting for survival
yeah
thats
but
i do think with working parents there are some real issues here that i think
uh-huh
i dont know
its an interesting problem
i happen to
im a pediatrician
oh
my husband is a physician
so i talk to parents about this a lot
but children
i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide whats best for them and their family
yeah
uh-huh
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
and i long ago decided im a better mother because i work outside the home
uh-huh
i really believe that
and it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldnt otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age
and i think our kids are real secure and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot
uh-huh
so i know it sounds like a rationalization
but i really think its true for our family
and i think it has worked very well
yeah
its like you said to each his own
and were planning on having my wife stay home
but
theres no question
i think thats really the best
if a woman is happy doing that
uh-huh
i hate to put it quite that way
yeah
i was $unc$twenty-nine when i had my first child
and i would not have been real fulfilled
i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child
uh-huh
its wonderful to be a mother
but i like the way i did it
right
i sort of worked half time
i had very flexible hours
i nursed all $unc$three of our children until they were at least a year
and you can do that despite working very easily which is $unc$one of the things i preach all the time to mothers
oh
uh-huh
and i think we choose very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in
uh-huh
some baby-sitting groups
again i know it sounds like a rationalization
but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children
and they learn to share
they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure
uh-huh
i think that helps
thats good
sounds like youre have a handle on it
your wife does she work right now
no
not right now
shes out
right
we just moved down here
we used to live up in $unc$seattle for a couple of years
youre still trying to dry out
thats no problem here
yeah
we really liked it up there
but then wh-
okay $unc$eric
are you married
and do you have a family
yes i am to both questions
okay
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
yeah
we do
we
basically theres the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every month
uh-huh
and we enter those into a spread sheet
and whatever is left after that we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for
uh-huh
i see
what do you do
thats basically what we do
about every $unc$three months or so we re-evaluate our budget
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
uh-huh
and then we divvy them up between our $unc$four pay checks
i work part time at night
wow
and my husband works full times days
and so we have $unc$four checks
but that works out nice because we get paid every week
and so that does help
yeah
that helps a lot
and then we dont have a lot extra for extra spending
so its pretty well ear marked
yeah
all allocated out
yeah
yeah
yeah
every penny is ear marked
but we have found that works the best
and so if we can just divide all the major bills up
in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half
and divide those up between all
uh-huh
all the checks
yeah
and so we are not taking a huge sum out of $unc$one
and then the next pay check were real short
or
right
yeah
we found that its definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
thats true
before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have
uh-huh
and it was easy to let things get out of hand
we thought it to be really helpful
we have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that
yeah
so
it helps you to focus where your money goes
yeah
and i am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget
but youre wondering when you put down all the money that you do bring in
and then youre saying my word where did all that money go
thats a lot of money
but
where does it go
yeah
but
and also we have found that if we write down
and we did this
we are not real consistent with this
but we did it for about a month
and we wrote down everything that we bought every pay check
uh-huh
and so we could see where every penny went
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend
and like i say we havent been real consistent with it
its
we should cause it does help
yeah
the other thing that weve found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit
uh-huh
its just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasnt unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever just put it in an envelope or whatever
uh-huh
and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount and then if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say its gone
just stick to that
uh-huh
that is
yeah
that sounds like a really good idea
and it really helpful
have you developed a savings plan or $unc$i $unc$r $unc$a $unc$s or anything like that yet
we havent
our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and credit card debt and all of that
uh-huh
uh-huh
we are just at a point where we could start thinking about it
so
thats good
thats a good feeling
yeah
i
my husband just graduated from the university a year ago
uh-huh
so finally we are getting to that point too
a student
are you still going to school
or
yeah
i am actually in the mas-
kay
okay
i guess were talking about exercise
yeah
yeah
first of all i have to ask you how old you are
i am $unc$twenty-seven
$unc$twenty-seven
okay
i am quite a bit older than you are
but no
i think exercise is extremely important
and i do exercise on a regular basis
you do
what type of exercise do you do
i do jazzercise which is an aerobic program that
you do
are you familiar with it
yes
its a national company
and we have a jazzercise center here in $unc$plano that has classes all day long
so you can
are they different from aerobics
or is it the same thing
no
its an aerobic routine
you warm up
and then you have $unc$thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate
and then you gradually go down again
and you do that every day
or
no
i only do it probably $unc$two or $unc$three times a week
okay
the minimum they want you to do is $unc$three times a week
and this is a club
or do you belong to a group
its really a
its called a center
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time
and then you just go in whenever you can
so i usually choose to go at $unc$nine $unc$thirty in the morning or a $unc$nine $unc$fifteen class or a $unc$ten $unc$thirty class in the mornings
do you go with friends
or do you go alone
no
i go by myself
and thats $unc$one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
yeah
and most of my friends that are my age dont exercise
or they might play tennis
uh-huh
and since i am not a tennis player i dont get that
but i am in my late forties
uh-huh
so there arent many people that want to do that
oh
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers with children between the ages
yeah
young mothers or
young mothers
young women with small children are the ones that i find
uh-huh
what do you do
i really dont have a routine
i like playing basketball
we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
and thats what i do every day
great
yeah
do you play every day
yeah
pretty much
when my wife lets me
who do you play with
do you have friends that play with you
or just
no
i just shoot around by myself
yeah
and thats about it
i use to play soccer a lot in high school
but when i graduated i havent done much
i dont have a problem
i know i have to do more aerobics
but i dont have a problem with weight
i could eat all day and not gain an ounce
thats really good
and i think that keeps some people from exercising
uh-huh
i dont have a problem with weight either
but i think i dont have a problem because i exercise
you do exercise
people are always saying to me how do you stay thin
and its because i exercise
you do it
but i also watch what i eat
uh-huh
but youll come
being $unc$twenty-seven you dont really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet
yeah
and i
but as you get older you will
everyones told me my waist line is going to expand $unc$one of these days
but i dont know
it might not
mine
because everybodys been telling me that too
and so far it hasnt happened
and i just feel like you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high
uh-huh
yeah
i guess i enjoy sports a lot
so thats why ive kept active in that way
yeah
but you dont play any other sports but basketball
basketball
volleyball
too bad its not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby
i do that
but do you ski
being in $unc$utah i was wondering if you ski
i use to
but it got too expensive
so
did it really
yeah
cause i know that skiing in $unc$utah is suppose to be great
yeah
a lot of people do that
yeah
but i never find the time
i had rather do other things
yeah
i have never skied before
but i have friends that go to $unc$utah all the time
and they think its really
they come up here
and they ski
i guess theres a place where you can ski
is it $unc$tahoe where you ski from
no
thats $unc$nevada to $unc$california i guess
thats in $unc$nevada
uh-huh
yeah
i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
yeah
but
but there is a place in $unc$utah called a funny name
theres $unc$snow $unc$bird or $unc$alta
but its like $unc$heavenly
is that it
$unc$heavenly
yeah
i think its called $unc$heavenly
ive never heard of that one
youve never heard of that
huh-uh
maybe it isnt in $unc$utah
but they said theyve skied $unc$heavenly
and it sounded like that they skied really well when they are actually talking about a place
its kind of funny
do they exercise much for skiing
i know when i went you can get sore easily
but
yeah
you can get really sore
i know you
ive talked to people
but most of these people ski enough so that they dont get sore
yeah
is $unc$one or $unc$two timer a year if i do go on them
and i am really sore after
and then is it your quadriceps that are the worst
yeah
in your legs and
my legs really really ache
yeah
yeah
but thats
i am using muscles that i have never used before
and its strange that you can do like i did aerobics all the time
and then i went horseback riding
and still i was so sore
and i couldnt get over
okay
$unc$frank what type of budget do you or your family have
i dont know that we really have a budget
i have a set amount that i save
actually there is a way
budget our money apparently
the
my wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks
and we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that
and besides that i have a set amount that i save every month
right
thats sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have
uh-huh
i am single
so i guess i dont know if thats an excuse for not having a tight budget
uh-huh
but i basically
really dont need to
right
i dont need to
i am the only that i have to keep track of
so it makes it a little bit easier
thats right
and also i try to save a certain amount each month as well
uh-huh
and i try to have an idea of what my expenses are
and i am pretty consistent from month to month
uh-huh
and whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
right
i found that things as i have gotten older
i am in my fifties now
but before we use to have a very strict budget
i had $unc$four kids
and we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that
kind of anticipate how much things were going to be
i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i kind of fence off areas of my check book
for instance there are certain things that i know come up every so often
every $unc$six months i have to pay car insurance
every $unc$six months i have to pay my taxes
so i take a set amount
uh-huh
ive got a money market account that i do a lot of saving in
and i also have got a checking account besides that
but what i do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty dollars a month i will just take $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty out
and i put it in parenthesis
i take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up
uh-huh
every month i add $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty dollars to it
then when the tax bill comes in ive got that much set aside
right
and i guess thats a way of budgeting
yeah
thats
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium or longer range
i just have maybe a targeted amount that i will save for
i am
probably within a year i would like to buy a new car
uh-huh
so i kind of have an amount in my mind
and i am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever
uh-huh
yeah
cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too
right
weve got $unc$two cars
my wife has a car
and i like to drive pick up truck
so we are on a schedule where i try every $unc$three or $unc$four years to buy a new one
and i am constantly making car payments
but i figure thats got to be the story of my life is making car payments
uh-huh
so i get one paid for
and actually i am saving up for another $unc$one besides
so its kind of a never ending thing
right
but you try to schedule those things so that youre not paying for $unc$two at the same time i guess is what i am saying
right
have you thought about leasing
i have thought about it
but leasing wouldnt
i dont use it for my business
i see
my wife uses hers just for pleasure
and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only $unc$ten miles away
right
so
but if you are rolling it over every $unc$three years it might be advantageous to do that
yeah
i guess
typically if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off
uh-huh
of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
right
yeah
youre right
i have been know to keep trucks or cars for $unc$ten or $unc$twelve years
but i find that after about $unc$four years they kind of start going down hill
and you got to put stuff in them
thats right
yeah
mines $unc$seven years old
and i think last year that was a rough year for it
i had a number of expenses
uh-huh
but i am hoping that most of them were just kind of
the
as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that
so i just went through that whole set last year
uh-huh
i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again
those things can really upset your budget when they come in
its nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected shall we say so that it doesnt kill you all in $unc$one month
right
right
what line of work are you in
hows your products been
i really havent had too many problems
seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
i hear that one
have you had any lately go out
yeah
ive had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all $unc$three
and they
unfortunately i bought them all $unc$three at the same time when i bought my new house
and i really dont have any recourse
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
wow
yeah
it was a hassle
so you didnt get anything
even all the warranties were out
yeah
the warranty on the refrigerator
the i-
the refrigerator warrantys still good
but the ice maker itself passed its $unc$three years
and it was $unc$three years and $unc$two months
youre kidding
no
yeah
we just moved into a new house too
so we had to buy all those too
watch out
yeah
the only thing ive had problems with is
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
uh-huh
and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that its nontoxic and such
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings
so
i didnt return it because itd probably cost me more than
i just ended up using it
but thats about the only thing ive had gone wrong
but
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances
but i just
it was within $unc$two days that all $unc$three of these stopped working
and the ice maker had to have a new pump
thats incredible
and the microwave had to have some kind of something i cant even pronounce
and they
the dryer had to have a new heating element
so it was almost $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars for all $unc$three of them
and they all went out at the same time
within $unc$two days of each other
or $unc$two days
wow
i was
it wasnt a good week
i was pretty mad
plus the place that id bought them all had gone out of business
so i think even if i had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that manufactured
but still they were through that retailer
so i dont know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not
wow
its frustrating
but i didnt have to worry about all that because they werent under warranty
so it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all
uh-huh
but i
the only other things that ive ever had trouble with
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
uh-huh
they go out a lot
yeah
ive had $unc$two or $unc$three of those go out
$unc$one was under warranty
and the other two werent
but i just
other than that t v and things like that i havent ever had any trouble with
i dont think products are getting much better though
yeah
im in the manufacturing
home from work
and make automotive air bags the safety air bags
really
yeah
thats interesting
at $unc$morton $unc$international
and i thin-
its changed a lot with the manufacturing environment
we test everything after each assembly process
and so our testing is pretty thorough
but
do you test each individual one
or do you just test
if youve got $unc$ten you test $unc$one
and by the test results of the $unc$one you assume that the other $unc$nine are okay
the tests that
we test every one electrically
we dont
i think they test $unc$four or $unc$five a day actually exploding the air bags
uh-huh
but we do test during the assembly product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure its there after we install it
so each assembly process has an inspection right after its done
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process
so
thats something ive never had to use
ive never been involved in an automobile accident
so luckily thats a product that i havent had to test
yeah
but i think its a great idea
im
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
but that
they do all the testing that we have to do through the government
its incredible how much testing they have to do
im sure they want to be thorough before they
but even
i dont mind spending the extra money on the car even if they pass the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing
uh-huh
im not a real big seat belt
my
$unc$jackie on taxes i guess i would have to say that my opinion is that i do think $unc$americans are paying too much in taxes
whats your feeling about that
i agree
i think taxes are high
right
where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
in $unc$new $unc$hampshire we have no what we call broad base taxes
no income tax and no sales tax
huh
we tax business $unc$eight percent
businesses are taxed $unc$eight percent
and we have what we call the $unc$five b s for our taxes booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
uh-huh
oh
so we do have a very low tax rate
but combined with the federal income tax i think that $unc$americans generally do pay too much in taxes
and
right
yeah
i agree
and i think its about the time of the year when you just start getting
if you do get money back from jobs
im still a student so i only work part time
uh-huh
so i get a check back
so
thats nice
from taxes
but
nice to get a refund
yeah
it is
but its not much
so
uh-huh
do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it
no
yeah
my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to $unc$washington or to the state
and they say they are going to send some back
its like $unc$one arm giving the other a transfusion
yeah
you know what i mean
yeah
it really
i should say $unc$one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because theres an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that theres a fly paper effect
yeah
there you go
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
and when you send it to $unc$washington or send it to your state capitol a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
right
yeah
i dont know
i
dont seem like they are doing much with it
theres plans there
and now that they are voting and people getting into drug and that stuff
uh-huh
they have nice plans
but they dont always work
and then they try to raise taxes more
and i dont what happens with all the money because if their plans dont work
but taxes get raise
so i dont know
im not really into politics
that it
i dont really understand it
uh-huh
but its just
it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend
its almost like they will spend as much as theyre allowed to collect
right
there is an interesting proposal thats been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax $unc$ten percent or $unc$thirteen percent
there would be no figuring
you would take your income tax
you would have a certain amount
you would take you total salary
uh-huh
those who made under a certain amount wouldnt owe any taxes
and then there would be a set amount for however many dependent you have
and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you figure up whos in your family
right
huh
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the $unc$i $unc$r $unc$s
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
yeah
the could be nice
yeah
huh
id like to see something like that
i think it would be fairer
and it would put a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail
but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all $unc$americans
right
yeah
it doesnt seem right that somebody that makes $unc$twenty-five or $unc$thirty $unc$thousand dollars pays $unc$four or $unc$five $unc$thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes $unc$two $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
right
huh
it doesnt seem fair to me
yeah
it isnt
there is not much out there that is fair
thats for sure
right
huh
i will agree to that
i think your taxes in $unc$wisconsin are pretty high if i am not mistaken arent they mean for your state
do you know what your state income tax rate is
no
$unc$twenty percent
i have no idea
i just
my dad does it all for me
you just pay it
i use
youre like my daughter who is in college down in $unc$massachusetts
and she works as a waitress
and she is attending college full time also
uh-huh
and she sends her taxes to me
and i figure them up
she really has no idea
she gets a refund check
and
okay
how do you keep up with current events
usually in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work
usually catch the news in the morning
yeah
what channel do you watch or what station
$unc$n $unc$b $unc$c
thats the $unc$one i watch
i usually keep up with t v
i dont
i am a student
so i really dont have much time to read the newspapers and stuff
uh-huh
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isnt too great sometimes
yeah
yeah
i usually tend to just rely on t v again just through the grapevine just to know what todays stories are
and i usually go out an buy a newspaper if im interested in any particular one
yeah
the radio doesnt really have much news sometimes
the stations i listen to are just mainly music
yeah
i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
yeah
do you think that t v is pretty accurate
sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
or
what i really dont like about t v especially local news as compared to national news is just it seems like everything is very spoon feed
and its more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is your kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school
yeah
yeah
its
they mainly go with popular topics just not basic news
uh-huh
yeah
also i have the observation with the press that any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press which only happened $unc$ten times in my life first thing anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
huh
yeah
its something wrong
going
looks like theyre going more for ratings than for actual news
uh-huh
i think probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
uh-huh
they typically have a better
i am from a small town too here in $unc$texas local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
uh-huh
and
yeah
the farm report
yeah
farm report and oil reports
thats pretty sad
or who killed who
uh-huh
also i have found that newspapers probably arent as bad as television
read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
and
yeah
in $unc$dallas i dont know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into lubys
and the story was
was that he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something
yeah
and the news covered it hours after it happened
uh-huh
and they were taping people who were crying who had everything
uh-huh
and then like $unc$three days later this local news station was using as their promo to promote themselves
uh-huh
i just thought thats kind of cold
yeah
i have seen that happen lots of times
$unc$channel $unc$x gives you the best coverage
we were on the scene with our team players
and
yeah
and it was just
they were showing these dead people
uh-huh
and they were showing people crying
uh-huh
just taking advantage of
uh-huh
they are trying to get the most emotional response for
yeah
it didnt seem like there was much coverage of the story
but just the play on peoples emotions
its just gotten so
somewhere its lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in $unc$walter $unc$cronkite that if
yeah
and everything
yeah
yeah
ive pretty much stopped watching local news totally
yeah
even the national news i just find it to be very watered down
yeah
very
what did you think of the coverage of the war
i found it very $unc$one sided
did you
it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
yeah
not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldnt have been there
but it just seemed like
they kept just showing how great we were doing
and it never really showed the damage that really happened thats
uh-huh
uh-huh
a lot of times the news coverage showed all the guys who didnt get hurt coming home and all the big parties
uh-huh
and they kind of
if they were going to show that why didnt they show the guys who got really hurt and everything
uh-huh
yeah
and i really think that in the involvement that the press states the military basically sets the press
think about taxes
i think theyre a necessary evil
i wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on
and that is you dont spend more than you bring in
you spend what you have
and
yeah
i think that the general idea is to spend during a time of recession for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy
but theyre running under the assump-
the way theyre running it now theyre running it under a deficit spending while were not under a recession
so theres never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that were running
so thats kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt
youre not going to payoff what you owe
so i guess the question was more like do you get what you pay for
i
it just depends
roads are very expensive commodity and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department
they need to make a living
yeah
theres
so i think for many years weve paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are to a great extent public servants we have not paid them really what theyre worth in what they contribute to society
uh-huh
i agree with that
but then again its hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments
i guess
im a student right now
and i dont make a whole lot of money
and so i kind of dont pay a proportionate amount of taxes i guess compared to what i get because all my education is state sponsored
i go to a state sponsored school
and my education all up through high school and stuff
so i guess im kind of in debt i suppose because i dont been paying taxes all that long
my parents i guess however have contributed to that for the education side of it and everything
but i usually end up getting money back
i will this year anyway from a
youre very fortunate
yeah
i am
i need it too
otherwise
we just try not to pay any more in than we have to
we pay in a substantial amount
uh-huh
we dont regret paying taxes
we do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
uh-huh
and progressive tax i think does not give people incentive to make more money
and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay
more taxes you pay
it should be i think a flat percentage
and that percentage ought to be an equitable amount
uh-huh
isnt
last year when they passed the tax laws for the $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety $unc$ninety-one whatever $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety-one i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i totaled them all up
and basically we were going to be paying $unc$seventy or $unc$eighty percent tax
wow
that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though theres taxes on different things
uh-huh
isnt
but theres a lot of taxes you pay that youre not even aware of that youre paying
like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax
uh-huh
theres a lot of hidden taxes
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank
uh-huh
the taxes that people dont think about that
yeah
the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes
uh-huh
there was that
which can-
was it $unc$jerry $unc$brown
$unc$one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing i think a flat percentage something like that
yeah
if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money
and what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes
uh-huh
and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say heres my break point im not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs
right
exactly
thats because until $unc$eight
and so
based on that who do you think youre talking to
youre talking to an employer
up until $unc$eighty-five or something was the
okay
you want to start
yeah
i might as well
$unc$one of the things im very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer issue
i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons
and that rather bothers me that i was in effect contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak
uh-huh
yeah
thats stuff we never even thought about $unc$three years ago
right
right
and $unc$one of the reasons they fixed up the freons $unc$eleven $unc$twelve and $unc$thirteen in that area was because they were inexpensive
they could be made inexpensive and lots of it
and in that its properties were great with the machinery didnt have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work
so
have they stopped that practice now
course theres a tremendous number of refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential utilizing freon $unc$twelve
and of course the new cars i guess starting with $unc$nineteen $unc$ninety-three will not have freon $unc$twelve in their systems
but theres the ton of after market machines and $unc$et $unc$cetera $unc$et $unc$cetera
yeah
and thats got me very highly concerned that thats going to be quite a while before we can undo this
now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession
but you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion
so i see us in somewhat of a catch $unc$twenty-two unless the banks or industry the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon $unc$twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound
yeah
because as i say theres a tremen-
how many families own a refrigerator
and then do you know that number how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in $unc$texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks
and the only reason i didnt get into that more when i had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree
uh-huh
and
so thats why i stayed more towards
and thats a polluting type deal too is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those $unc$two mixed together with water really make a mess
yeah
yeah
i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter thats putting out a lot of dark smoke
uh-huh
and i know theres a lot of pollutants we cant even see coming out of cars
right
but that particular bothers me
most of the time when you see the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor
uh-huh
because when diesel is burned its it
diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine
its burned so completely that you dont have any nitrous oxides or oxides of nitrogen to form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is not very volatile where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long its gone
uh-huh
yeah
diesel is going to be around because it doesnt evaporate easily
and its got
its latent heat is high
but its slow burning at normal pressures
thats why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated by virtue of the compression process to $unc$one to $unc$nineteen or $unc$nineteen to $unc$one ratio
i see
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so if the car sucks in $unc$fifty degrees
how do you feel about trial by jury
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently
in what way
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence thats presented
i have very little regard for the law presently practiced
do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
i was thinking primarily criminal cases
do you think that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
yes
uh-huh
thats a concern of mine
i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges doing the sentencing
uh-huh
the only thing that really bothers me about that is i think that a judge can be
i like the idea of juries of your peers in that you get personally more than $unc$one person making a decision
uh-huh
and second of all you get a wide variety of background
so that
yeah
my question i guess are they really your peers
uh-huh
id agree with that
too often i think they are not
thats definitely a problem
uh-huh
and when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have is a matter of concern to me too
uh-huh
i think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
uh-huh
now i happen to know several judges
and there is $unc$one that i would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury i would feel a little bit uneasy about
uh-huh
but the other $unc$two i feel would give either the plaintiff or for the defendant the full benefit of the law
uh-huh
and i guess thats what i am concerned with
yeah
yeah
i guess i definitely agree with you
but the
what i dont like about the jury doing the sentencing in that i think it becomes a lot less
uh-huh
the same crime gets unequal sentences
this is very true
i think there is more of an ability for selecting $unc$two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board
yeah
and you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar
uh-huh
uh-huh
but $unc$one individual got $unc$twenty-five years
and the other $unc$one was sentenced to life
so
uh-huh
of course a lot of thats also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer
isnt that the truth
uh-huh
there are times when goodness my mind has gone blank its $unc$othello
you know where he says kill all the lawyers
every now and then $unc$one is tempted to see what
yeah
i agree
but its taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i agree with it
yeah
they will admit to you that they dont have the benefit of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
uh-huh
its more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
and they are very effective too
that the
uh-huh
even
i have been involved just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty
uh-huh
but his attorneys gotten him off
uh-huh
the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
so i dont know
yeah
this is a little bit of the subject
but $unc$one thing that i really dislike also thats new is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
okay
so you have $unc$eight children
what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together
we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling going to the park some time watching v c r movies generally cheap things
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
we know how that goes
with lots of kids you dont have lots of money for recreation
thats right
thats fun
so lets see
some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot
and you may think this is funny
but $unc$one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek
and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when its dark in our house
yeah
and that is so fun
the kids just get a crack out of that
we do like to go to the park too like your family
we dont do a lot of vacationing
have you taken a lot of vacations together
or
most of our vacations are to go and see $unc$grandma and $unc$grandpa
uh-huh
and whe-
we get an occasional $unc$one or $unc$two day thing
oh
but most of them are going and seeing $unc$grandma and $unc$grandpa
now where do they live
in $unc$arizona
so thats a bit of a drive for you there
yes
so you like to go there for the holidays
and
we dont go very often for holidays
generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let $unc$grandma and $unc$grandpa come and visit us
uh-huh
uh-huh
what are the ages of your kids then
they range from $unc$twenty-four to $unc$five
yeah
so you have some in the nest and some out
thats right
how old are your children
we have
ours start at $unc$twelve
and then they go down to $unc$four
i think the hardest thing for us is to find leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have
i bet
yeah
the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing
uh-huh
but the young kids dont understand it
yes
uh-huh
and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that
and
yes
and then if you want to play something on the little kids level then the older kids get real bored
and they want to do something else
so
yeah
yeah
i can relate to that
do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive $unc$one or a negative $unc$one
i think its improving actually
uh-huh
we had an interesting experience the other day
we have pretty much a routine that we spend
we dont have our kids play with other kids on $unc$sunday
uh-huh
and we just kind of keep them at home
uh-huh
and our next door neighbor
we were at a soccer game $unc$saturday
and our next door neighbor was there
and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend $unc$saturday night at their house
uh-huh
and she said no sundays our family day
uh-huh
and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them
thats good
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now
good
i think its gone to $unc$one extreme where the families were just running all different direction
uh-huh
and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now
i think so
and i feel like $unc$president $unc$bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation
and it does begin with the families at home
yeah
and so im a firm believer in that too
i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing theyve got to start doing something
so
yes
thats true
we see that a lot out here in $unc$utah
and hopefully its going to spread
utahs a lot better than $unc$texas
oh
do you have a lot of large families out there in $unc$texas
or
very few
very few
you feel like youre in the minority
definitely
when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didnt have good sense
dear
but
out here in $unc$utah $unc$five is about the average
average
yeah
my wife and i were in $unc$utah until i guess we were about $unc$twenty-four
oh
uh-huh
never been back since then
but we have kids up there now
oh
so we get up occasionally
oh
i have some relatives out there in $unc$texas
in fact my moms out there in $unc$texas right now in $unc$dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch
and
where in $unc$dallas
no
im trying $unc$aberdeen
is that close to $unc$dallas
i dont have any idea
ive never heard of it
oh
must be a little town
dont you
i guess its out there clear out
they have a ranch that has like $unc$five $unc$hundred acres
and
yeah
okay
$unc$martin do you do any exercise
yes
i do
i like to play basketball and weight lifting
those are probably the $unc$two main things i like to do
uh-huh
so those are more or less indoor sports
hows the weather out there in $unc$georgia
yeah
in the winter typically its probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis
i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
uh-huh
but in the winter it gets pretty cold
oh
yeah
so its mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
uh-huh
how about yourself
yeah
im on a exercise program
im riding my $unc$aerodyne bike half an hour every morning
uh-huh
and im just about ready to up it to up to $unc$forty-five minutes a morning
and i feel like thats been a real nice exercise in the winter time
its kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
uh-huh
right
do you do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
no
huh-uh
first of all id like to get my weight off
im about $unc$fifty pounds overweight
and so id like to get the weight off
and then id really like to get into that
uh-huh
and my husband and i have a aerobic video thats called the $unc$firm
i dont know if youve heard of it
but its an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down
but youre using weights
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done
its really fun
yes
its similar to aerobics with weights
yes
uh-huh
but its like low impact aerobics just with weights
uh-huh
yes
okay
are you familiar with step or bench aerobics
no
yes
i am
but i have never done it myself
have you done that
yes
i have
in $unc$atlanta thats
most of the health clubs are all
oh
thats the in thing
thats the big thing
at first it was just regular aerobics
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
oh
so how is that
they call it a low impact aerobics
and its supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
oh
and from when ive done it it does give you a real good workout
but only thing im concerned about is potential for injury to your knees and movement of going up on the step that could create a problem
oh
uh-huh
yeah
they seem to think that it wont
but you never know
now if playing basketball are you knees
do you have healthy knees
yeah
i think my ankles probably are my main weak point
dear
but ive kind of taken care of that
i wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff
uh-huh
and wearing that i havent had any problems in the past year or so
thats good
you sound just like my husband
he injured his ankle about $unc$seven months ago playing volleyball
yeah
and hes just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
yeah
i
so thats what he does
he wears his brace and his high tops
and
uh-huh
yeah
i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
oh
oh
it would only take $unc$three or $unc$four days
and i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
wow
uh-huh
dear
oh
so how successful is your exercise video
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches
uh-huh
and id like to do the $unc$forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week
and then every other day id like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
uh-huh
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off
and the muscle builds real fast
uh-huh
you can start
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month
and then after that you can just start with your $unc$five pound dumbbells and then build up to your $unc$twenty-five pound dumbbells
uh-huh
and then youre just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video
and its a hour long video
so
so its a good workout
it is
yeah
i really enjoy that
so im looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy
uh-huh
so in the winter i guess theres a lot of
its quite cold and snow
yes
yes
now this $unc$one has been quite mild
we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about $unc$three weeks of snow on the ground
it was quite chilly
but not
hello
i pressed the button $unc$one
so were recording right now
im sorry
thats okay
im $unc$bill from $unc$raleigh
okay
and im $unc$melanie from $unc$harrisville $unc$utah
another $unc$one from a different state besides $unc$texas
yeah
okay
$unc$bill were talking about family reunions
right
okay
have you ever had to plan a family reunion
yes
and no
it wasnt really a planning one
but it was a birthday
oh
and i brought a lot of family together then
uh-huh
and how did you feel it went
it went pretty good
ive worked in hotels
so i kind of know how to do these things
oh
i used to
all this planning and getting together and such
lets see what else
usually when we have kind of our family reunion its my grandmothers birthday
and its all of like she comes from a big family
uh-huh
she has like $unc$seven sisters i think
boy
they show up and all their kids
and then all she has
i have
lets see
she has $unc$four sons and $unc$two daughters
and they show up and all their kids
uh-huh
so its a pretty big reunion
its about $unc$two $unc$hundred people maybe
my word
what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together
probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone could eat comfortably and everything
uh-huh
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent we rented a rescue squad building or something like that
oh
uh-huh
and everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for soft drinks
and so nobody really got stuck with the bill
oh
thats good
and each person in the family brought a dish or something
uh-huh
and then did you have a main meal
or did everyone just bring
it was just pot luck
it was kind of pot luck
uh-huh
everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
yeah
yeah
show off a little bit
yeah
and of course my grandmothers food was as always gone first because shes such a great cook
oh
oh
now how old is she
shes $unc$eighty-six
goodness
is she pretty
now she does
she looks probably like shes in her early sixties
wow
and if she didnt have arthritis shed get around better than me as a matter of fact
uh-huh
oh
thats neat that shes in good health at that age
yeah
yeah
my nickname for her is $unc$honey $unc$woman
thats what i call her
really
that sounds fun
i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago
and there were
we sent out $unc$five $unc$hundred announcements because our family is quite large like your family there
and so that was a real challenge
and i was president of our family reunion for $unc$two years
and i wasnt very at that duty for $unc$two years in a row
but i found that advance planning was the key to success
also $unc$one thing thats helpful
and i dont know if your familys spread out or whatever
uh-huh
but all my family lives in the same county
so
thats wonderful though
but its just kind of like get on the telephone
and its so and such days from such and such date
oh
and everybody just shows up
that is helpful
yeah
our family ranges from goodness $unc$australia
i have a brother lives in $unc$australia to $unc$boise $unc$idaho and all kinds of places
i would say youre spread out then
we are
my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess were the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever
because my dad was in the $unc$army
and were pretty strung out all over
oh
but since theyve moved back to $unc$carolinas we still are the only ones do not live in $unc$yantsen $unc$county
in
oh
i live in $unc$raleigh
and then my parents live in $unc$greenville
and i have $unc$one brother and his wife live in $unc$greenville and another brother that lives outside of $unc$fayetteville
uh-huh
so were spread out
but everybody else is centralized in my home town $unc$waynesboro
boy
so
my gosh
nobody moves away except us
they must really like it there
yeah
i got out as soon as i graduated
yeah
oh
just like this town is too small for me
good-bye
youre ready to move on to bi-
how do you feel about gun control
i dont think that guns should be outlawed
but its going to
a lot of the stuff that
all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in $unc$killeen $unc$texas not too long ago but i dont really know unless they do just outlaw them how you can prevent that
uh-huh
uh-huh
dont you think that just having some almost like a drivers license be required with stiff penalties if you are found with a gun that is not registered or that you are not licensed to carry
yeah
that
do you even know what the procedures are now
there is no national
but its kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
in most states as long as you arent a convicted felon or on probation or other obvious things like that
yeah
and i know that in a lot of states you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before be obviously insane
but have your legal right to get a gun
i didnt know that
thats pretty scary
so do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it $unc$one to $unc$ten
yeah
id probably say about a $unc$five
thats where i would probably be
seems like its a good safe number to pick
i dont really know how they can really enforce the laws any better
uh-huh
because i do think that some people need them for protection and stuff
uh-huh
and i can understand them wanting to have them
but then again its just like all those nuts out there
no-
if you are looking at country where they do have a lot more gun control like $unc$england and places like that
the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
it has
because then
yeah
the
in comparing $unc$per $unc$capita murders are incredibly lower than the $unc$united $unc$states
the problem though since the $unc$united $unc$states had this pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think if you were introduced any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already
yeah
so its really kind of a complex problem
is the crime that bad there in $unc$atlanta
im not really sure how bad it is
ive not really had that many problems with it
but apparently we were ranked pretty high up
yeah
i know $unc$dallas is
i think in the te-
i think we have been ranked in $unc$one of the top $unc$three for murders in the last few years
i dont know if $unc$dallas is in the top $unc$three
uh-huh
but do you own a gun
no
ive thought about getting $unc$one
if i get $unc$one i think i will probably get something
i probably wouldnt get a hand gun
i would probably get a shotgun
just for protecting myself from burglar type thing
uh-huh
i do kind of live in the downtown area
yeah
and shotguns are really good because theyre
somebody is not going to break in steal it and use it to mug someone
thats true
and you
yeah
i just dont understand these people like when they decide theyre going to buy a gun to protect themselves
they go out and buy a $unc$three $unc$fifty $unc$seven magnum which is going to shoot through
they are probably going to miss the person
and theyre going to shoot through $unc$five wall and hit someone
a shotgun just really struck me as being a real good defensive weapon
you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of whoever
yeah
you pretty much stop them
and you dont
then the actual shot doesnt go that far a wall will stop it pretty much
and my dad gave me a gun
uh-huh
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
uh-huh
so i finally ended up giving it back to him
i said i dont want it
i dont want to be responsible for it because if youre not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to be responsible enough to go out and learn i dont need it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that really does scare me people that have guns
because if you ever get in the situation where you are not prepared to shoot
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you
yeah
and they get it from you
and youre pretty much dead because youve just told the person that youre about to kill them then
uh-huh
set them off
and you basically made it clear to the person that you are a real danger to them
and then if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to stop you
yeah
thats why i ended up giving it back to him
i thought i dont want it if i dont really know how to use it
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i just didnt want the responsibility
so did you hear about that $unc$killeen massacre or whatever
yeah
did it happen at a cafeteria or something
yeah
right
it just makes you wonder how people get guns
uh-huh
i would be scared selling guns to people
so $unc$julie how do you feel about aids research
i think we definitely need more of it definitely
id agree too
but it seems like it just makes economic sense in that
it would have made even better economic sense to have had a lot more research than a longer ago
yeah
yeah
for certain
because the countrys going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
exactly
uh-huh
exactly
do health insurance policies for companies and things do they cover diseases like that
i think they cover aids
but what they do is if you apply to get a insurance policy theyll check to see if youre h i v positive
uh-huh
and if you are not only will they not give you a policy
but they have
theres a database of people that have tested positive
so youll never be able to get insurance ever again
but thats why they should have started doing stuff before
still since its dormant for such a long time theres still probably a lot of people before the tests ever really came out who are draining a lot of money right now
yeah
i think a lot of it was just that because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about
right
right
that
right
and all these god-fearing people were like $unc$god is trying to kill off all the $unc$et $unc$cetera $unc$et $unc$cetera
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
$unc$one humorous retort i heard someone who claimed that aids was gods punishment was that then lesbians must be gods chosen people
yeah
but
boy
thats a good one
yes
do you actually think were doing enough right now to
no
i really dont
i did a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff
and really were not doing much at all
its not really federal movement most of what gets raised by conscious communities and things like that
private organizations
uh-huh
$unc$san $unc$francisco has a real strong aids support group and all that kind of stuff
and they get donations from the community and from corporations around the city for aids research and that kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level rather than just in the places where its predominated so far because its bound to spread
uh-huh
it seems that its just going to reach a steady state a lot lot higher point than it will if wed nip it in the bud to quote $unc$barney $unc$fife
right
yeah
i dont know
i dont know
i dont know what the likelihood of that is
but people really waking up
uh-huh
especially with the ultra conservatives move our political system sort of seems to be taking
uh-huh
uh-huh
i would probably agree with that
yeah
so
so do you think its more important to spend money on research or for support of people
god
thats a good question $unc$fish
i dont know
i think $unc$one of the main things thats really important to spend money on is education not support or research $unc$per $unc$se but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society kind of like lepers would
uh-huh
uh-huh
and its really not necessary until the disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious
uh-huh
and i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people try to understand what theyre going through and everything and try to understand that they dont have to be just completely cut off from the community
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i dont know
i guess i think that research is i guess the most important just because it really needs to come to an end
uh-huh
i dont know
i dont know $unc$fish
what do you think about that subject
i think it stands a really interesting question of
do you have a $unc$p $unc$c
yes
i have a $unc$macintosh $unc$s $unc$e $unc$thirty
uh-huh
yeah
a lot of my friends are into $unc$macintoshes
i have a $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$p $unc$c myself
uh-huh
a $unc$two $unc$eighty-six
im probably eventually going to get a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six
what do you use yours for mostly
mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal
uh-huh
but i think eventually ill start using it for spreadsheets and things like that
what do you find that you use yours mostly for
i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base
and about the only thing
im just starting to get into a little bit more communications now
ive just today ordered a fax modem
so ill be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using
uh-huh
you dont have to make a hard copy that way
uh-huh
are you using windows
no
i think im planning on moving up getting a $unc$three $unc$eighty-six before i move up to windows although i do like the graphical user environment
uh-huh
uh-huh
its getting to be more and more like a $unc$macintosh
yeah
its
i just want it more for multi tasking which i suppose is also like a $unc$macintosh
uh-huh
the $unc$one thing i used to use a
ive never used an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m actually
i used to use just an $unc$apple $unc$two $unc$e which of course looks pretty primitive now
uh-huh
yeah
thats what i learned a lot of languages on was an $unc$apple $unc$two e in my high school
but i dont have any real programming capabilities on my $unc$mac right now
uh-huh
i dont have any compilers
uh-huh
so im
do you use your computer for just things around the house or in the
i use it in my business
what do you do
i do consultation and testing of various kinds for $unc$english as a second language programs
wow
and do these programs
are they based on a other language
or are they based
a lot of the $unc$english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of parts of the world
and the teacher just tries to teach $unc$english through natural understanding
thats the kind of thing im working with exactly
uh-huh
you seem to be better informed than the average person on that
it was just when i was high school i worked for the community school
and they had a $unc$english second language class
and it always seemed strange to me that all these people that spoke $unc$english not too well and spoke a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
uh-huh
i imagine its a lot harder on a computer because you dont have as many cues
you dont have hand gestures and things like that
right
now we
what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though
uh-huh
most of the stuff that i do is not interactive
uh-huh
and i use it for data analysis on testing
so
to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests
uh-huh
when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones arent find out how reliable the test is
uh-huh
uh-huh
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort
so its involves a lot of spreadsheet use
yeah
i would imagine so
so what were you doing when you were using an $unc$apple $unc$two e
i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files
i cant believe ive got $unc$five megabytes on this $unc$one now
uh-huh
its
and on my $unc$two $unc$e $unc$i had a $unc$hundred $unc$twenty-eight k
yes
its amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much
i remember my first computer was a $unc$t $unc$r $unc$s $unc$eighty with $unc$four k on it
yeah
and then i started playing with $unc$apples
and those had $unc$forty-eight
or if they were really great they had $unc$sixty-four k
the original $unc$apple had $unc$forty-eight i guess didnt it
i know that in my school they had a bunch that had $unc$sixteen k on them is all
and
my goodness
i remember that there was $unc$one game that i played that required $unc$forty-eight $unc$k
and there was only $unc$one computer that had $unc$forty-eight k on it at the time
uh-huh
and its just so amazing that generally if you
im not sure about $unc$macintoshes
but i know $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m you buy a megabyte at a time
uh-huh
thats the low end
the $unc$s $unc$p $unc$thirty goes up to $unc$eight
uh-huh
but i havent upgraded it quite that far yet
i think probably when i get system $unc$seven i may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk
i dont know
they say that system $unc$seven uses a lot of memory
uh-huh
yeah
i imagine
okay $unc$bill
right
yes
okay $unc$bill
have you done much camping
yes
im a scoutmaster in $unc$boy $unc$scouts
uh-huh
and i camp at least $unc$one weekend
and during the summer we camp $unc$two or $unc$three weeks a year
that sounds good
id say i camp quite a bit
yeah
you do
do you have a lot mountains
you dont have mountains in $unc$texas do you
where do you find places to camp
we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
oh
and we also carry all our equipment with us
uh-huh
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on $unc$one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
oh
my word
that sounds adventuresome
how about yourself
ive done i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i
we have $unc$five children
and so we have found that camping with the little ones isnt as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves
so weve tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out
and we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
thats good
and then our boys are old enough now
theyre $unc$twelve and $unc$eleven
and so theyre involved in the scouting
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
uh-huh
and last time our $unc$one $unc$twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week
and so this year theyll both be going
and so thats been real enjoyable for them
great
what kind of camping do they like best
do they like it where they have tents
and do they cook on stoves
yes
theyve
no
actually i remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
and i dont think theyve taken the stoves
last year they camped in tents
and this year i believe they will be in tents also
uh-huh
course i imagine it gets cold in parts of $unc$utah
uh-huh
yeah
it doesnt get very cold in $unc$texas
so lots of times we dont even take tents
is that right
we just use trail tarps
and what does that consist of
its just a piece of material that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent like a
oh
uh-huh
theyre very light weight
and we use them when we go backpacking
so we go backpacking $unc$fifteen or $unc$twenty miles then
theyre not very heavy
uh-huh
so you carry them with you
and theyll keep you dry or whatever
oh
yes
when we go camping here
we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents
and i like to sleep on the air matresses
im not
my bones are getting so old
so i like to sleep on the matresses
uh-huh
so have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that
yes
in fact last month we went camping
we saw a lot of deer in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere
oh
my word
gee
uh-huh
but even though it wasnt hunting season
and we were with $unc$boy $unc$scouts
so of course we dont want to go hunting
uh-huh
but we got to see a lot of deer out and about
oh
and theres
of course we see smaller animals all the time
and $unc$one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the foods put away and so forth because we have armadillos
oh
do you know what armadillo is
oh
theyre covered with a heavy armor type stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
and possums and raccoons
my word
and we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
uh-huh
and so that can be a problem if you dont put all your equipment away
but they wont necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
they will if you attack them
oh
but most time they run away from you if they see youre up
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they dont have any problem walking right by you if youre asleep
my word
that sounds a little less fierce than bears
we want to
music do you like
lots of different kinds i guess
i like country music of course
uh-huh
$unc$texas
and i listen to $unc$christian music a lot because theres a $unc$christian music station here in our city
so i listen to it quite a bit
uh-huh
i am more into rock and roll myself
uh-huh
and i listen cause on $unc$friday nights they have what they call $unc$saturday $unc$night $unc$alive
or on $unc$friday night and $unc$saturday night and they have $unc$christian rock and roll
uh-huh
so
they have that type of music
but they just have different words
so i listen to that too
do you like any bluegrass
no
not really
huh-uh
oh
and i like rap music
at least your
do you like rap music
not really
not really
i can tell were together here
yeah
okay
well have to
what kind of
i have a lot of friends that like country music
what kind of rock music do you listen to
do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff
or
no
im more into older rock like the psychedelic era like
seventies and like that stuff
late sixties seventies
uh-huh
$unc$greatful $unc$dead $unc$crosby $unc$stills and $unc$nash
yeah
i have friends that like that
what
yeah
you have never heard of the $unc$christian music that i listen to probably
ive heard a little bit of it
ive just
have you heard of $unc$carmen
have you ever heard of $unc$kim
ive heard of $unc$striper
so the only $unc$one i can
$unc$striper
theyre the heavy metal stuff i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
the first of $unc$amy $unc$grant before
yeah
became more mainstream top $unc$forty
yeah
cause she plays both secular and $unc$christian
so
uh-huh
yeah
i like her too
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers
ive never actually seen her in concert
i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
she does
uh-huh
shes real good
so i like her
uh-huh
i like some country music
its just that i like finding a lot of its
i dont like the country music thats like my wife left me my dog left me everybodys left me
yeah
$unc$mama got run over by the train
yeah
i dont like that
uh-huh
i like $unc$randy $unc$travis
uh-huh
i like more of the real new ones
like $unc$garth $unc$brooks
$unc$garth $unc$brooks
yes
hes fine
$unc$reba $unc$macintyre
yeah
i like them
i dont care for the older the dog left me stuff
you dont like $unc$patsy $unc$cline
you dont like $unc$patsy $unc$cline
no
huh-uh
i dont even really know who she is
but have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like
that music that you like to
yeah
actually i just went to see the $unc$greatful $unc$dead i guess about a week ago
but arent they done with
i thought that they
no
they are still on tour
they have been touring since the late sixties
and i just thought that they done broke up and left
no
theyre still together
theyre still making albums
wow
i didnt know that
uh-huh
thats interesting
in fact there are people that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that
uh-huh
cause they are on up there in age arent they
yeah
theyre like late forties early fifties
but whenever $unc$one of them dies off they get a replacement
okay
alright
they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players
they keep on dying
and they keep on replacing them
and the new ones in this thirties
alright
but
cause they look pretty rough
ive seen picture of them
and they just
yeah
they dont actually look as rough as the $unc$rolling $unc$stones
they just
i dont know if you saw the tour posters of the $unc$rolling $unc$stones when they last toured
but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
yeah
cause they just
all their faces were just all shriveled
uh-huh
yuck looking
uh-huh
it just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
uh-huh
are you into that rock music all that druggy stuff and all that
you know what i am saying
they come on the stage
and you
they dont even know they are there
they are just so out of it
actually i prefer my performers to be pretty sober just so if theyre jamming that they dont just lose themselves and go into lala land
yeah
uh-huh
so i just dont like
uh-huh
that
so i dont know
have you seen any concerts lately
so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
generally i dont think they are
my personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because theyre entrenched
uh-huh
they dont ever have to go out and get a real job
they just stay in their current job
uh-huh
you know what i mean
i agree with both of those things
but do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
i think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems
uh-huh
but it has to be not just at the national level but at the state and the local level too
i know some senators
and i dont know which ones
but theyve been in office since the $unc$nineteen forties
uh-huh
and i
theyve never had a job
theyve never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes
i know they pay taxes
but they dont
yeah
they get paid a $unc$hundred and $unc$twenty-five grand a year which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit
uh-huh
and im going like i dont understand how theyre supposed to be my servants and yet theyre paid more than i am
uh-huh
and they work less than i do
uh-huh
the only problem i see with term limitations is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that there is a learning curve and that you cant just send someone off to $unc$washington and expect his first day to be an effective $unc$congress person
i think theres a lot they need to learn when you get there
i think thats true
however i think thats always been true
uh-huh
thats true of the $unc$presidency too
and we seem to be able to get along with the $unc$president turnover ever $unc$eight years or $unc$four years
and
yeah
but
they
there is a lot to learn
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up
i think $unc$two years is too short
uh-huh
i think it would have to be extended
a term limitation for $unc$congress would be like $unc$three terms or even $unc$four terms
or you would increase the length of each term of a $unc$congressman
but maybe standardizing on a $unc$four year term for $unc$congress $unc$senate and the $unc$presidency and then staggering them so that we arent tackling a massive ballot every $unc$four years
uh-huh
the other thing that bothers me about our system is just that in $unc$congress the amount of power any particular $unc$congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long theyve been there
so its for
so unless you have actual across the board limitations the idea of
were
im just going to vote against the incumbent every time doesnt work
its going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states arent doing it at the same time
uh-huh
i think that thats true
but then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
uh-huh
the $unc$c $unc$i $unc$a is moving out to $unc$west $unc$virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency
the action isnt in $unc$west $unc$virginia
i hate to tell the senator from $unc$west $unc$virginia this information
but it really doesnt the world does not revolve around $unc$west $unc$virginia as far as this country is concerned
the world does revolve around $unc$d $unc$c as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics
uh-huh
and the $unc$c $unc$i $unc$a is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in $unc$west $unc$virginia
yeah
it might only be $unc$two hour drive from here but thats a $unc$two hour drive
yeah
and i think its a mistake to move large agencies like that
uh-huh
or is it the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i
i dont remember
but i think theres
l-
t-
i dont see why it makes a big difference the $unc$c $unc$i $unc$a because officially they dont have any operations within the $unc$united $unc$states other than administrative
yeah
thats officially
uh-huh
we all know that thats not necessarily true
but i think that there are advantages to having seniority or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years
i think theres an institutional memory that you need to maintain
uh-huh
but i think that with all the perks that weve given them
i heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where they arent paying their restaurant bills
and theyre bouncing checks all over the place
uh-huh
uh-huh
$unc$one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
i dont know
i think the budget is really out of hand right now
and especially in this election year i think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
uh-huh
yeah
it kind of seems to me that everyones offering their token little tax cut program when its just such a bad time for it
right
right
and as you said mostly they are token cuts
especially what for instance $unc$george $unc$bush is offering
yeah
the $unc$ninety-seven cents a week
yeah
$unc$ninety-seven cents a week
what
thats really not going to do a lot of good it doesnt seem to me to your average middle income person
uh-huh
another $unc$ninety-seven cents
hell you can buy a coke or something for that
yeah
mostly its not actually a cut
its just a cut in the amount withheld
yeah
yeah
i dont see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot
that ninety-seven cents really isnt going to do it for me either
huh-uh
i havent really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either
especially the democratic candidates dont seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
uh-huh
yeah
in retrospect was it $unc$mondale or $unc$dukakis that said ill tell you right now im going to raise taxes
i believe it was $unc$dukakis
it was $unc$dukakis
yeah
but i cant
i have a lot of respect for him
yeah
thats better than $unc$george $unc$bush who came out and said no
i will not and then $unc$ten months later he said sorry i cant follow through on this
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand
and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over
and were supposed to be getting a peace dividend of $unc$x number of $unc$billion $unc$trillion dollars a year
uh-huh
id really like to know where that money is actually going to go
because in my opinion i dont think im ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend
yeah
yeah
its
if they could actually put something together and make
im not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also
uh-huh
but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
uh-huh
yeah
i think that would be a great idea like the conservation corps where
$unc$right
exactly
it would help unemployment greatly
and it
and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
yeah
infra structure is in
we have hurt ourselves incredibly last $unc$fifty years in the cold war
yeah
and theres no way that we can ever really recover from the state that were in right now at least i feel unless we focus on the infra structure
and i surely dont hear anybody saying that right now
uh-huh
yeah
i agree totally
it just seems so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen
im in college right now
and
so am i
really
where do you go
$unc$i $unc$u
$unc$right
i go to $unc$georgia $unc$tech
uh-huh
and in
what
i had the required political science class a couple of years ago
uh-huh
and $unc$one of the things we discussed was how the budget situation just got so out of hand
right
and essentially what happened was
i think it was like in the tax year of $unc$eighty-one
$unc$ronald $unc$reagan basically said im going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew that the $unc$congress would not in their right mind pass
right
and the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the $unc$trillion dollar deficit
uh-huh
right
and you just
you just have to wonder what theyre thinking in $unc$washington
its just like theyre playing chicken with a loaded gun
yeah
its more than a loaded
its a loaded cannon
theyve got trillions of dollars to spend every year
yeah
and they in my opinion dont do a very responsible job of spending that money uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
what really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say im going to raise taxes and cut the budget and were going to have to do some unpopular things he wouldnt have a chance of getting elected
its kind of like $unc$rome and the bread and circuses thing where people just want to have whatever will make them feel good right now
for the moment
and thats what really is getting me about what $unc$george bushs stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that youll be happy come $unc$november and youll elect me again
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then im going to go on and just forget everything that i said
uh-huh
or it doesnt seem that its going to make much of a difference
uh-huh
it
i dont know
i dont think $unc$george $unc$bush will make the american people happy with $unc$ninety-seven cents a week
no
no
not at all
i just dont think it was a well thought out incentive
no
how do you feel about crime in the city
you say youre from $unc$atlanta
right
actually i live in the city
uh-huh
and i guess it is a concern of mine for my own safety
uh-huh
do you find crime in $unc$atlanta really
i live in $unc$atlanta also
thats right i think it is bad in certain areas
however i think the area that i live in the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city
uh-huh
i think it seems that theres certain areas where the crime is focused
uh-huh
what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
i think whats been happening over the last several years it seems theyve been beefing up the police patrols trying to put more guys more cops higher visibility
and theyve had some impact but not a tremendous amount
uh-huh
and probably they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think
i probably agree with that
yeah
particularly in some of the housing projects that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused
uh-huh
and theyve got to do more than just having cops there
theyve got to kind of change the way people think about it
yeah
thats probably true
so do you think atlantas as bad as most other cities
ive been to
id say its probably in the top $unc$ten in terms of crime
its nowhere near as bad as $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city for example
uh-huh
probably not as bad as $unc$detroit
uh-huh
i dont think its as bad as $unc$l $unc$a either
no
i dont think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
yeah
that seems to be true
yeah
if youve ever been to $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city
and as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
uh-huh
uh-huh
its that obvious
yeah
i dont know
i came to the conclusion also that if you are walking in a downtown area where theres a lot of crime a lot of thats going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim
yeah
thats true
just walk in a confidently
with a big stick
or
and dont be looking around like youve never been there before and you have no idea where you are
right
sure
right
dont walk down an alley
or dont get
yeah
just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation
uh-huh
but yeah
there are times when you cant avoid all that
and then youre kind of on your own
yeah
have you ever been mugged in $unc$atlanta
no
the only thing ive ever had was ive had my wallet lifted
uh-huh
but that was in a more of a setting where there was a number of people around
and i kind of got
i was much younger at the time
uh-huh
and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so i didnt know who had it
uh-huh
uh-huh
ive had that happen
but thats about it
yeah
ive been pretty lucky about getting mugged
yeah
yeah
i think ive only actually seen $unc$one actual robbery with a gun
and thats been about the only potentially violent crime that ive seen in $unc$atlanta
really
ive had my
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
uh-huh
ive had my car stolen
so maybe that counts
really
yeah
where was that
was that downtown
or
no
that was up near $unc$cumberland $unc$mall area
really
its actually $unc$cobb $unc$county
but it is $unc$atlanta
metropolitan
yeah
and theres a lot of car thefts in that area
yeah
ive known some people that have had their cars stolen
and about half the time the $unc$a $unc$p $unc$d seems to recover them in various states of disrepair up on blocks
right
yeah
my friend had a $unc$v $unc$w $unc$rabbit
and when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat
yeah
it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage
but they didnt strip it
uh-huh
so i got it back
youre probably luckier than
yeah
than most
uh-huh
so does insurance pay for the body damage
or was that all there was body
right
it was about $unc$three grand to put everything together
they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
yeah
you crack the steering column
and you pull the
theres a pin in there that you can pull on these $unc$g $unc$m cars
uh-huh
and you can start it up basically pretty easily
uh-huh
so how do you know this much about stealing cars
after i found mine i had this
how you like $unc$new $unc$jersey
its pretty good
you get closer to the coast here
and you do get a good bit of smog and stuff especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants
right
i dont know what part of $unc$new $unc$jersey youre in but i guess its fairly industrial
yeah
its
when you get further east towards $unc$new $unc$york $unc$city it gets very industrial
right uh-huh
but im about $unc$thirty miles west of there
so you have actually green trees such that you dont notice that other part of $unc$new $unc$jersey exists
yeah
yeah
right
actually very
you go even a few miles out and you got farms and everything
so you relatively clear air
right
but
i dont know about you
but ive always considered automobiles to be probably the prime contributor
theres a lot of contributors
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that
definitely
its
yeah
there are a large number of them on the road
theyre all going
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair
thats a big issue is
a lot of states dont have a inspection law
so you get a lot of people out there without $unc$e $unc$t $unc$r emission control systems on their cars and things like that
even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year
yeah
and its like
you get the car thats in the accident
and muffler falls off or something
sure
and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that
right
i guess from what i hear though next year $unc$ford is coming out with their electric cars
theyre actually coming out with the first prototypes in $unc$california
yeah
that
and i think also some of the car companies are coming out with gas powered fleets so you
yeah
natural gas powered rather than gasoline
right
im hoping that comes along quick
i was reading an article in $unc$time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast thats going
and i guess its really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize
and i know its not due to gasoline or to carbon monoxide so much as the c f $unc$c
but
it is coming from cars though
yeah
i think thats a contributor definitely
the car air conditioners is $unc$one of the major leaking sources of the freon which is $unc$one of the major fluorocarbons
right
right
yeah
i guess right now what theyre primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess $unc$united $unc$states and $unc$russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production
but it
it
go ahead
no
its the type of thing there that
the third world countries are less industrial
and they want to become industrial
uh-huh
so theyre on the different part of the cycle of the $unc$u $unc$s
the $unc$u $unc$s used all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today
right
and thats $unc$one of the arguments that the third $unc$world countries have been using is that basically they dont want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense
in terms of
or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we got to
exactly
exactly
those are joining arguments
but i dont know
thats kind of an interesting situation there
those third world countries what they dont realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting
i guess the latest figures are up to $unc$fifty percent at the poles
and its increasing even as near the equator as $unc$florida and $unc$cuba and those places
yeah
so its kind of an interesting situation
its not a real good $unc$one actually
no
but
you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of whats clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
you dont get that source of cleansing anymore
have you been in big cities a long time
ive mostly been in the east coast
so thats going between $unc$atlanta $unc$d $unc$c area
okay
so youve got
a-
yeah
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think
not as hard as some places out west because you dont get the major pollution sources as you do out in $unc$denver with the inversion and $unc$los $unc$angeles and rest of $unc$california which is just terrible it sounds
yeah
denvers definitely
yeah
thats $unc$one of the worst
sure
yeah
denvers that real good example of sitting in a valley kind of like $unc$mexico $unc$city does i guess
uh-huh
$unc$mexico $unc$city is historically been $unc$one of the worst in the world for that
yeah
but ive been pretty lucky
ive lived in cities that really havent had that much of a problem although im really kind of based in $unc$orlando $unc$florida
and there you can tell that its getting worse
definitely its not at a level comparable to $unc$los $unc$angeles or $unc$denver
but you can
yeah
there its almost all automobiles because theres not that much in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it
exactly
yeah
and theres not that much in terms of public transportation down there
uh-huh
there is
but its
okay
should begin
okay
all right
i can begin this
basically i work for $unc$honeywell in $unc$minneapolis
uh-huh
and the benefit program we have here is really quite good
im pretty pleased with it
they cover just about everything vision dental medical
uh-huh
you name it
and for me this is the first job ive had where theyve covered that much
so im pretty satisfied myself
uh-huh
whats your situation
i work for the $unc$university of $unc$new $unc$hampshire
and our benefits package isnt quite as good in some ways
oh
overall im satisfied with it
we dont have the vision care
we do have the health care and the dental
uh-huh
are you a professor there
no
im on the professional administrative and technical staff
and effectively i run the telephone switch at the $unc$university of $unc$new $unc$hampshire
i see
okay
probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the very generous vacation time and sick time
no doubt
we get $unc$fifteen days a year sick time
and right from the day $unc$one when you start work you get $unc$twenty-four days a year time off
right
thats good
yeah
yeah
thats $unc$one of the things i guess i would change about $unc$honeywell is
i used to work with the $unc$army $unc$research $unc$institute
and being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
right
but here you dont get that
you maybe get $unc$two or $unc$three a year
uh-huh
so its really
unless you have some vacation time or some sick leave or whatever you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time
uh-huh
so thats kind of a drawback i think
but i dont know
what do you consider most important you think in terms of the different benefits
i think the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit
uh-huh
and the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing
yeah
im a little disturbed about that
but i think thats a national trend
and i dont know what the solution is to it
its bigger than just the benefits part
yeah
i dont know if you saw on $unc$twenty $unc$twenty the other night
they basically reviewed the $unc$oregon $unc$plan toward nationalizing health care and that kind of thing
uh-huh
right
its kind of an interesting plan
its kind of cold though
theyve essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff
yeah
about $unc$six $unc$hundred and $unc$eighty-seven and below will not be covered by subsidized health care
and the ones above would
so its kind of like drawing this line
and if you have it great
if you dont youre kind of out of luck
uh-huh
but it was kind of an interesting show
i think youre right
i think health care is probably the pressing $unc$one
right
but ill tell you i dont mind having dental
sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive if not more
and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
uh-huh
but im not sure thats widely followed any more
im not sure
how does $unc$university of $unc$new $unc$hampshire handle it
we have $unc$two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending
and the cost between them is very little
i think it costs me something like $unc$five dollars a month for the dental plan
but it pays a substantial amount
the examinations and checkups every $unc$six months are free
great
and it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
let me interrupt is that the same for both professors and also staff and administration
is that generally across the board do you think
or
yes
it is
the benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff which are considered to be clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the p a t staff which i belong to
right
uh-huh
but the main
i think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan
but the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
uh-huh
okay
for the operating staff its based on how long theyve worked there
right
that determines how much vacation time they get
yeah
im kind of interested because thats the route id like to take when i finally get my degree is to teach in a university
uh-huh
uh-huh
im a doctoral student in $unc$florida right now
oh
but
yeah
thats interesting
thats $unc$one of the things id like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that
college programs belong to this t i a a c r e f retirement fund
is that right
right
and in the case of the $unc$university of $unc$new $unc$hampshire
okay
all right
whats your view
whats your view
i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns personally
yeah
yeah
thats true
even if they give it a shot its still going to be black market all over the place
thats right
thats right
i dont know
coming from $unc$texas youre probably
i dont know
i shouldnt make stereo types
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
yeah
it is
but im not really from $unc$texas
i just live down here now
ive lived down here a couple years
youre just live down there
yeah
im originally from $unc$colorado
but yeah
theres a lot of hunters here
yeah
i know how you feel
i grew up in $unc$nebraska
and we always use to go out and hunt all the time
and man theres no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons
uh-huh
thats just
i dont know
i think its ridiculous
yeah
it doesnt sit with me very well
i dont know anymore
i keep a $unc$thirty-eight in my truck
really
yeah
i just about all
i live in $unc$minneapolis
and i
i live in $unc$florida
but i am staying in $unc$minneapolis for a year
and both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
uh-huh
right
and its just you never know who is out there
right
its just for self protection purposes
and then of course theres the hunting issue
so
sure
yeah
thats good
what do you do $unc$jeff
im in program control for a company up here
yeah
yeah
all right
we do schedules for programs schedule programs
yeah
what do you do
im researcher of $unc$honeywell up here
okay
yeah
you guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
or
i havent had a chance to do any hunting since ive been down here
i dont own a shotgun
but id like to go bird hunting
yeah
thats something i miss quite a bit
yeah
when i was in $unc$colorado we went deer and elk hunting quite a bit
yeah
but
yeah
all right
yeah
my brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in $unc$idaho for a while and really enjoyed it quite a bit
but i dont know
i guess that what the scale now is its $unc$zero for a complete
$unc$one for a total ban and
thats right
i guess i am about $unc$eight or $unc$nine
yeah
i agree with you there
yeah
no doubt about it
but
if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they cant
yeah
im not for it
yeah
if theres a way to limited it to people i dont know that
i guess they passed a couple of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you go to buy a hand gun
uh-huh
and then they actually
i know its this way in $unc$florida
they have a waiting period where you buy $unc$one
and thats a week
uh-huh
and then they check you out and make sure you dont have a record and things like that
i think thats a pretty good idea
and thats
i dont know
thats not a bad idea
but then again you can always get around that
you could go through the black market like you say
you always be able to get around
but
sure
yeah
its $unc$one of things
but i dont know
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like im not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
yeah
i dont either
yeah
im just not
i think those have been pretty much banned altogether anyway
yeah
i
there
fully auto
but even a semiautomatic i guess thats
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
yeah
right
its like what can you do with that that you cant do in a self protection situation with like a $unc$seven or a $unc$twenty shot $unc$twelve
sure
you might do the same thing
right
and so its like i dont know it does
it takes the sport out of it
for me i would much rather have a bow anytime
really
i like bows
i have done some bow hunting
and i get into it
and i think its more of a challenge
yeah
but i dont know
i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
sure
but i dont know
thats about where i stand
me too
you
yeah
i am about the same way
and have you eaten yet or whatever
yeah
is it $unc$seven oclock there
yeah
its about $unc$seven $unc$fifteen
you guys central
how is the weather up there
its not too good
its kind of rainy
is it
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about i dont know $unc$ten or $unc$twenty degrees
right
and its been up around $unc$forty
so people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature
ice is starting to melt and stuff like that
so
yeah
i am just up here for the year
and its kind of shocking
$unc$wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that
right
let me ask you the question
do you have a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
right now im in college
and im on work study
uh-huh
and so my budget comes from my dads help
uh-huh
he helps me out a lot
and i get paid monthly
so thats kind of hard to have a budget
my mother doesnt get paid much money
so her budget is just planning for i r as
i see
i see
good
im kind of in a different situation
but i went through that too when i was in school
but i was working to get through college and trying to make it through that
but im married and have a couple of children
and we have to pretty much stick to a budget
uh-huh
im on a salary
so i dont get any overtime or anything like that
but we have a fixed income
oh
and we have to make sure that every dollar we have is spent accordingly
and what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have the house payment
uh-huh
we have the insurance premiums utilities and so forth
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know were going to spend and set that money aside
and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the kids college education the future and set aside money for bonds
uh-huh
and we also set aside an emergency fund
because weve been married for about $unc$ten years
that sounds good
and we find out that no matter what kind of budget you stick on theres always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out but you have to have money for
right
right
and then we have
whatevers left over is discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month
and its worked out very well
its helped us so that we havent been too long on the month and too short on the money and try and stick with that
thats good
and nice thing about it my wife is excellent in that we both work together
we both have a budget
and we stick to it
good
and theres no surprises in that
with $unc$two kids that could be hard
i have $unc$four kids
$unc$four!
yeah
i said a couple of kids
i guess i should have specified
i have $unc$four little boys
my goodness
yeah
$unc$four boys
you bet
my goodne-
you bet
its just me and my sister
all right
and my parents divorced $unc$three years ago
uh-huh
and my sister had gotten through college
but i was still in high school
and my mother paid for a lot of my sisters college while my parents were together
yes
and then before the divorce she had saved for my college
uh-huh
but when we had the divorce she just didnt get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house
oh
so now my dads paying for all of my college of
good
good
and financial aid and scholarships
uh-huh
im a music major
so i have auditions coming up
yes
what year are you in in college
im a sophomore
youre a sophomore
you have a few more years
right
right
ill probably have about $unc$two and a half years left
uh-huh
good for you
good for you
yeah
i imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget during school and so it forth
it sure is
i know how much my dad is going to give me every $unc$two weeks
yes
and i dont spend over that
great
great
and sometimes thats a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff youve got to work on too
sure
theres always music books to buy
lab fees and all
yes
yes
youre not a starving artist yet are you
no
no
no
good
i dont plan on being a starving artist
good
thats why im in college
theres enough of those in the world
right
good
good
im glad to hear that $unc$wendy
w-
thats usually because theyre not real educated
they cant afford to have a really good job
whos not very well educated
the starving ones
yes
yes
theres enough out there that if youre educated enough then you can make money
thats true
thats true
i found that out
so thats why im planning and preparing for the education of my children also try and set that money aside
right
what did you major in
i majored in business administration
good
you know plenty about planning a budget
yeah
but once again
