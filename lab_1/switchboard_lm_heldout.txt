do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in $unc$one
no
but my grandparents were looking into it before
so i know what theyve said
uh-huh
uh-huh
im trying to think
my wifes grandmother had alzheimers
and they were going to put her into a nursing home
and when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance or worse than a nuisance
she sort of went bananas
they thought it was too much of a bother
and they couldnt deal with her
so i guess you need to know whether its a no deposit no return kind of thing whether
right
if theyre equipped to handle the kind of patients youre going to have put in there too
yeah
because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
right
they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
but they wanted to be independent as well have their own room
right
my grandmother actually was in a nursing home that
there was a retirement hotel and then a
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
so for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes but could also go and eat someplace else
uh-huh
and then as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care
and she didnt have to do anything anymore
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly
and thats som-
i dont know whether thats because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only $unc$six months or something
a lot of its probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
yeah
they need health care
so theyre already ill before they go
right
thats probably a large factor
yeah
if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are
then you only go there as a last resort
uh-huh
or people send you there as a last resort
right
right
thats what my grandparents
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
uh-huh
so that was their thinking
somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency
right
and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldnt be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time
right
i guess thats a problem too for people wait lists and all
yeah
i guess
that
you cant always get in when you want too
and of course you cant just sit around and wait
right
when you need it you need it i guess
yeah
and the money is also another issue how youre going to pay for it
right
at that stage of life you only have so much money left
and i guess its not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
yeah
it is kind of fair
but its also not fair because they have their own children to raise
sure
so its another problem
and if it were you you probably wouldnt want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
right
right
so its just so complicated anymore i think
people outlive their savings
and with medicine being the way it is youre extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
and theyre not necessarily enjoying life anymore
yeah
maybe thats the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that its not worth continuing
its just a shame thats the way it has to be
i think the retirement home ideas a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
yeah
and cause if your spouse died all alone itd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you to have friends
right
yeah
ive known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities
i dont know if they have them back there
but here in $unc$california and in $unc$ari-
okay
i say they
probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
if they sink theyre innocent
i see
a good southern solution
yeah
how do you feel
thats of course being facetious
but
uh-huh
youd have to say that
i dont know
the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing
uh-huh
and seems to me that i think thats the way its done now
at least my understanding of the law which isnt very good
uh-huh
it seems to me that the judge does it
and i think thats probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing
uh-huh
and i guess also what the system will absorb
right
probably more tuned in to that
possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty
uh-huh
im kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole
he could have a personal prejudice
judges are people like everybody else even though theyre supposed to be impartial
thats right
but maybe
and i think that may be an exception as well
because i think that
doesnt the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge
i think thats the way it is
yeah
they decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty
do they have a death penalty in $unc$california
yes
in fact theyre going to execute somebody at the end of this month
yeah
uh-huh
and theres a big uproar going on right now
yeah
the $unc$governor has been trying to decide whether hes going to commute it or not
uh-huh
its someone who had killed $unc$two teenage boys here in $unc$san $unc$diego as a matter of fact
yeah
i
something like that ive got no problem with it
yeah
i guess the way i think about it it shouldnt necessarily be thought of as revenge
its just like if youve got a dog thats running wild and biting people
uh-huh
put it to sleep
just get it out
its not able to fit in
something inexpensive
yeah
yeah
exactly
i guess kind of the way i think about it also is they just
if somebody gets the death penalty theyre judged guilty
they got the death penalty
they should have $unc$one year and $unc$one appeal cover all their bases with $unc$one appeal
and if not dont let them sit up there on death row for $unc$fifteen years
yeah
i think this particular case has been like $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen years
uh-huh
yeah
that
but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
and youd hate to be $unc$one of those
yeah
im sure
yeah
the other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all verdicts
uh-huh
maybe not
i dont know
at least in capital cases id think theyd have to be unanimous
i believe it is in capital
i think in lesser cases its $unc$ten out of $unc$twelve or $unc$five out of $unc$six whatever how ever many is sitting on a jury
uh-huh
i believe thats the way it is
but im pretty sure youre correct on capital cases
yeah
the paper here tonight had a thing about the $unc$noriega trial and that theres $unc$one juror that is different than the other $unc$eleven
uh-huh
yeah
and theyve only deliberated $unc$four hours or something
and they say theyre hopelessly deadlocked
no
and the judge told them they werent hopelessly deadlocked yet
im telling you go $unc$one way or the other
thats probably an expensive trial
yeah
$unc$six months so far they said
yeah
probably
yeah
probably
im not sure theres a number
its probably $unc$thirty $unc$forty $unc$thousand dollars a day worth of all the free for all
maybe they could go with a $unc$nine $unc$hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote
yeah
yeah
thats been so long ive practically forgot who $unc$noriega was
right
that has been going on
my cousin is a $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i agent down in $unc$miami
really
yeah
so she follows that stuff pretty closely
but
thats interesting
yeah
shes not involved in that case
but she does
have you ever served on a jury
no
i havent
i never have
my wife has
but i havent
uh-huh
i got called
but i never got selected for a jury
uh-huh
i sat for $unc$ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process
uh-huh
and they had some guy that was defending himself
uh-huh
bye
our discussions about the care of the elderly
thats right
thats right
what do you think is important
if you were
i dont know how old you are
but if you had parents say or grandparents whatever it is who were ready who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for
my dads almost $unc$ninety
and he lives by himself
and hes in good shape
yeah
but some friends of mine have gone through this
i think id look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive and where there were caring and compassionate people operating it
yeah
do you have any experience with this yourself
my wifes grandmother is in a nursing home in $unc$minnesota
uh-huh
and we go there once a year
we tend to see her there cause were in $unc$boston
so were pretty far away
when we visit $unc$minnesota though we go to see her
uh-huh
and it seems
the environment there i dont know too much about it
but it seems nice enough
its hard
at least half of the residents i would say are not mentally sound
so its hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity
from the lack of stimulation you mean
yeah
i dont know
we also my wife and i volunteer to go to a nursing home thats just a mile from our house
she goes more often than i
we used to go once every $unc$two months to visit some of the patients there
and we have a $unc$two year old son
and so sometimes wed take him with us
and there i would say its the same thing
its a relatively nice environment
but again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on
its must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really dont know where they are
do you think that in the case of the $unc$one that youve actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what youd perceive of as genuine concern
i think yeah
i think theyre relatively respectful and concerned in as much as they can be
ive noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively but things that are not reasonable
uh-huh
and so at some level the
yeah
im sure that the staff learn whats normal for this person
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this persons needs is really because this person is just in a state where they dont really need what they think they need
yeah
its possible
i was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to peoples needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
yeah
yeah
ill tell you $unc$one thing though that i saw that was really nice
we saw a husband and wife
we used to see a husband and wife in there together
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
but these $unc$two were
uh-huh
and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house
uh-huh
so it gives them a sense of identity
and so
yeah
you walked in there
and it didnt look like how you walk into some rooms
and its completely generic
theres nothing maybe a picture or $unc$two that belongs to that person
and thats it
but this room on the other hand they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that
and they had all their stuff from their house
and it looked like it must have been
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them
and it must also give them a sense of security and s-
yeah
i think part of what youre saying matches what i have read
i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities physical or mental that they couldnt take care of themselves
yeah
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide a lot of social activities
yeah
$unc$one of my friends parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation
and
temporary
i
thats new to me
i
i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
and i feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there
right
right
and theres so much
okay
i guess youre probably in the same situation were in
were kind of past having to provide child care
our kids are grown up
we dont have any grandchildren yet
but theyre
uh-huh
how old are your children
ones $unc$twenty-six
and the other is $unc$twenty-one
uh-huh
so theyre getting there
theyre going to be getting there
theres no prospects right away for anything to happen
yeah
uh-huh
i see
but
i have $unc$five children
i have a $unc$eighteen year old son
the rest of my girls are $unc$twenty-three $unc$twenty-six $unc$twenty-eight and $unc$twenty-nine
uh-huh
and i have $unc$three granddaughters right now
oh
and i
ones in $unc$iowa
uh-huh
and shes a teacher
and what she does is she teaches at a preschool
okay
and so she kind of
and they let her bring her little daughter in for free
uh-huh
so
but she just works part-time
uh-huh
then i have another daughter in $unc$bountiful $unc$utah
and she has to work full-time
and its just tearing her apart
she has a private baby-sitter
yeah
and the baby just screams
the baby is $unc$seventeen months
and she just screams
uh-huh
even if she knows that theyre fixing to get ready to go over there
theyre not even there yet
uh-huh
yeah
its hard
we
and then i have a $unc$seven month old granddaughter
and her mother stays home
and they live with us as $unc$orange $unc$county is really expensive
uh-huh
uh-huh
they live with us
and so of course we love it because we get to see this cute little baby all the time
but she just
she used to work in the preschool and child care
and she says after working in there
and here she was a provider
but theres only so much $unc$one person can do
yeah
she said its so awful
she said shell never put her child in a preschool
uh-huh
im sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
huh
but its really very difficult
and
yeah
what did you do when your kids were growing up
were you
when
the first $unc$ten or $unc$twelve years i stayed home
uh-huh
and then after that i went to work
uh-huh
and a couple of times i just
then i had $unc$one job
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job
and then later i tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter
supposed to be good recommended person from the church
and i knew her personally
she had $unc$two kids of her own and everything
but i quit my job because i couldnt stand how she was taking care of my child
uh-huh
first of all her children were sick all the time
so when my son stayed over there he got sick
he got sick
yeah
same thing that her kids had
right
right
and so we didnt take her over there until about $unc$eleven oclock
then shed take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten
but s-
that day i was saying now hes sick
and she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have
thats what he got
goes okay
so its not like hes going to infect her kids
but then what happened is i said he just threw up
and kindergarten starts at $unc$eleven $unc$thirty
so she said shell keep him home
and hell probably just sleep anyway
you know what
that woman sent him to kindergarten
she sent him to kindergarten
as soon as he went there the teacher took $unc$one look at him
and he threw up again
and they put him in the nurses office
guess so
yeah
and then what happened is they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter
called her
and they said that hes sick
she wasnt home
all her kids were sick
but she wasnt home
and her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
why didnt she keep him home with her
no
she didnt do that
so it got to the point where hes supposed to get out of kindergarten about $unc$two $unc$thirty
and i had to leave work
it was $unc$five oclock in the evening
and i found out he was still there at school
and they were calling me
and they said somebodys got to pick him up
and i kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives $unc$two blocks away from the school
i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff
and he had a $unc$hundred and $unc$four fever
they couldnt give him anything because theyre not allowed to at school and everything
right
i was so furious
i quit that job
and i stayed home for awhile longer
then i went and got a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
yeah
a little more flexibility
you can come and go
yeah
but i havent had any really very good experience with child care
yeah
when our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house
we in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to keep track of daily finances
way back what $unc$twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and checkbooks and all this kind of thing
and we kept that going for about a month
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it
uh-huh
that sounds about right
so the only thing that we do now is i keep a little spread sheet of what i call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth
and i only update that i dont know maybe once every quarter or so every $unc$three months just basically when the statements come in just to see whether or not were getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
uh-huh
right
thats really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that were doing
its kind of difficult for me because right now like most teachers im laid off
and
oh dear thats terrible
so i spend most
i substitute a lot
uh-huh
so its very hard on a nonfixed income because i dont know how many days im going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances
uh-huh
but i know how much i have to bring in a month
and thats about it
thats about as far as we go
and then anything extra is more or less split up between all of us and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day
uh-huh
i see
are you married
are you living with people that youre sharing expenses
no
im a single mother
i have $unc$three children
i see
uh-huh
so right now we get aid from the state at this point because theres no other way to do it
and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesnt pay child support
oh dear
so right now i know what im getting from the state
and i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible any time they call me in
uh-huh
but i still have to figure out
if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid
and if i dont work enough days then i dont get enough to meet the bills
and its like a juggling act every single month
uh-huh
this week ive been just holding my breath and hoping theyll call me in
but they probably wont because next week the kids have school vacation
i see
so the $unc$four days before they only have a $unc$four day week
uh-huh
and they usually dont need subs because everybodys pretty good about coming in
i see
they dont like to be absent before a vacation
sure
but im shopping around as far as trying thats why im doing this to get some extra money and getting pledge sheets for the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
uh-huh
my kids are in $unc$boy $unc$scouts
so trying to get pledge sheets for the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
because every penny i bring in is $unc$ten percent to me
so its sort of helps defray the costs a little bit
but we do a lot of robbing $unc$peter to pay $unc$paul
i guess were in the situation that a lot of middle-class $unc$americans are in
uh-huh
yeah
youre the first
my next door neighbor just lost his job in $unc$one of these
my $unc$lord
his company went bankrupt
it was a subsidiary of an outfit called $unc$u $unc$s $unc$shoe or something
it was a computer subsidiary
i dont know what a shoe companys doing running a computer company
really
but they just folded it up and told him to
they took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office
uh-huh
and everybody else was sent packing
oh
hang on $unc$one second
ive got
sure
somebody was knocking on my door here
it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present
it sounds terrible to say
but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be in terms of keeping score of input and output
right
uh-huh
definitely
do you have a computer at home
or
yes
we do
and we try to
uh-huh
i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in
uh-huh
every single day im at the computer
i see
and its like what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasnt come in yet
uh-huh
yeah
do you use a standard spread sheet
or
hi
hi
i should say something
uh-huh
that im the least informed
this is totally accidental that i have to talk about this topic
but im the least informed person in the whole $unc$united $unc$states
this has not been determined yet
but ive never read a newspaper in my entire life
and i never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless im just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off
but
any particular reason
no
ive explored that with lots of people
theyve tried to lock me up and things like that
but im basically not interested
and i also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and off the
what am i trying to say
i do learn about things largely from friends
uh-huh
and i occasionally will read something like the $unc$new $unc$york $unc$review of $unc$books
someone will write a book about something
and then ill learn all about this thing that was in the news $unc$two years earlier
uh-huh
but it
and somehow
and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i dont have much confidence in it
but i dont think its just that im lazy
i really dont
i like to refer to this as sort of $unc$consumer $unc$report phenomenon which is everybody that i know reads $unc$consumer $unc$reports so the people who do feel that $unc$consumer $unc$reports does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i guess you could explain it $unc$two ways
and the cynical view is these things arent doing a very good job at all
and the view that i would rather take is that theres a different amount of information you need when youre particularly interested in a topic or particularly interested in buying something as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things
uh-huh
right
yeah
and i think the same thing is true with news
if you want to just have an idea as to whats going on most papers and especially the better papers the $unc$times the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal the $unc$washington $unc$post give you a reasonable idea
uh-huh
yeah
if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want theyre not printing because the average person doesnt need or want to know that much
right
doesnt want
let me ask by the way just for the record
i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
im not being elitist in that sense i hope
theres a reasonable question as to whether its worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things
yeah
what
and most people think it is
and i can accept that some people think its not and can find better ways to use it
yeah
by the way when you say most people think it is
i think its like $unc$ninety-nine point $unc$ninety-nine think it is percent
i dont think its that high
you dont
i know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but dont spend the time to actually read a newspaper
right
and i think theyre saying if somethings really important ill at least find out that it happened
yeah
and thats is a reasonable start
and for awhile i didnt read a newspaper when i came out here because i didnt find one that i liked
and if something important happened it was covered on t v
and i could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about
uh-huh
and i imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened youd find out from friends or other channels
yeah
i did on the $unc$supreme $unc$court hearings for the whole business of
i actually have a
$unc$clarence $unc$thomas or
yeah
the $unc$thomas and $unc$anita $unc$hill business
right
thats the closest thing
i deeply cared about that
uh-huh
and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more
and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on
but even then i didnt end up doing it on my own
yeah
i stayed as far away from those as i could
uh-huh
i decided i didnt want to waste the time
i had i guess $unc$five years ago now wasted that kind of time with $unc$oliver $unc$north hearings and afterwards decided that what i had gotten out of it just wasnt worth the time i put in and that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out
right
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
do you ever read
what sort of company do you work for
do you work for a big or a little place
i work for $unc$georgia $unc$tech
yes sir
i work for the research facility
and its kind of small in a sense
but it does have about i guess $unc$two $unc$thousand civil employees
uh-huh
and on a scale i guess its still considered small
it just have a lot of different laboratories
uh-huh
the area i work in it primarily have maybe a $unc$hundred people or so
uh-huh
so thats make up most of the laboratory
so from that standpoint its pretty small
uh-huh
what about yourself
huh
i work for actually probably similar kind of place
i work for $unc$lincoln $unc$laboratory
okay
yeah
we actually do some work with some people down at $unc$georgia $unc$tech
okay
i see
and
so were actually part of $unc$m $unc$i $unc$t
so its very much the same kind of place the technical institution
okay
right
while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what things were important besides salary and a job i guess list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the challenge of the work and the working conditions things like that
uh-huh
right
i dont know
what sorts of things would you consider important
those and probably the security aspect of it
uh-huh
because a lot of time nowadays even though youre working youre treated
and it may not be true in every place
in a lot of cases i think youre treated more like a number instead of a person
uh-huh
because when it come down to layoff they dont really consider people and their well being as far as how their next dollar going to come in
how they going to pay their bills
they just lay them off
yeah
and i was reading this book $unc$one time about this guy that had
i think the company still exists
what they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off
uh-huh
that way that $unc$one person wouldnt get $unc$one big blunt blow at $unc$one time
uh-huh
and i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than something like
unemployment is good
but the company as a whole
because you as an employee even the company is making money
they paying you a salary
but you are responsible for that company growth
youre responsible also for helping that company get to the point that its at at making profits
so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that
uh-huh
because its not a persons fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time
i dont see how $unc$one or $unc$two people maybe more $unc$one or $unc$two but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation
how do you mean that
i know it
in a sense that say how do you make a conclusion that youre going to lay off these $unc$ten people for the bad times of the company
uh-huh
what about the work effort those $unc$ten people did when the company was doing well
uh-huh
in that standpoint
you think its better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company
or
yes
i do
uh-huh
i really do
i think itd be better that way
and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that there are problems
uh-huh
and there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at $unc$one time
yeah
uh-huh
thats my views
yeah
ive heard of a couple of companies that have done that
i think back about a few years ago when things were tough $unc$hewlett-packard did that for awhile
they went to a $unc$four and a half day work week rather than just cut everybody back $unc$ten percent and have to give everybody a half day a week off
right
right
right
and i think you can do that for a little while
but im
at least that would give a person a chance to look because the way it is a person really dont have a chance
yeah
okay
how are you
you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget
yes
yeah
i feel like i am from $unc$mars
im $unc$fifty years old
and ive been divorced for $unc$eighteen years
but ive $unc$two kids and all
but ive never had a budget
and i dont do any planning
and i dont know
i dont have a long-term financial plan
i dont try to control my expenses
but im glad youre a stranger
that sounds kind of like me
but really im curious how other people live
so maybe we should start with you
what do you do
about the same thing
really
yeah
oh
maybe theyre going to arrest us both
im even in worse shape because i have $unc$eight children
and we live from hand to mouth
we hope that theres enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if theres not then we due for the next month
wow
a couple of times weve tried some things
and they worked
but im not disciplined enough to keep doing it
uh-huh
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
yeah
and when the envelope was empty then you didnt have any more money to spend in that area
uh-huh
and that worked out real well cause we didnt have to keep writing down what wed spent
uh-huh
it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
and we did that pretty successfully for about $unc$three months
and then we started borrowing from $unc$one envelope to put it in the other envelope
and in about $unc$two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
the
i had a part-time job around gosh $unc$fifteen years ago $unc$seventy-six
and this was a sort of a career shift at the time
and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that
and i actually did
my bank account would
i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month
but i had miscalculated
i didnt keep a balance
its $unc$one of the problems
i never had to in the past
i always kept plenty of money in my checking account
but when youre only earning half the salary even though i wasnt spending much money i sometimes would just
things would get to tight
and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
and every time i spent money cash mostly i would write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i would forget to write the things down
and i dont know if i ever went as far as $unc$three months or not in keeping that kind of data
i certainly havent done that in $unc$sixteen years or whatever
i even find now with the automatic tellers ill go take money out of that
yeah
and then i forget to take that out of my checking account
uh-huh
and
yeah
so i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that whats really there
uh-huh
and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
uh-huh
the
i have to say that
lets see at this point on i dont run out of money
and it
and i dont
someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i dont have
and i think my strategy if i may is to not spend money
i dont have expensive tastes
i dont go out
i buy a car
the last car i got rid of id had
it was $unc$nineteen years old
yeah
people were embarrassed for me
it was a good car
and
but it was still running
it was great
my mechanics loved it because it was a $unc$sixty-five $unc$buick
and it just wouldnt stop
and it
i just didnt feel the need for a new car
it isnt like i couldnt afford $unc$one
uh-huh
and now i dont
i tend to eat expensive food
i dont mind buying a good steak
but for me i only do that every week or maybe once a month
yeah
you buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous $unc$twelve dollars a pound
you buy less than half a pound so its $unc$six or $unc$seven dollars
to me i realize if you have $unc$eight kids youre not going to run out and do that
not very often
but im just saying as a single person thats a drop in the bucket
and so if youre extravagant on how you buy food it doesnt add up if youre not going to super expensive restaurants which i dont care to go to
thats right
so thats i think $unc$one of the reasons i dont need to budget is that i dont have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i cant afford it because im not interested in that expensive thing
a lot of
you want to go first
no
you can start
okay
$unc$one of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision
uh-huh
and i really dont agree with that
i think that the trial by jury is better having a unanimous decision rather than to have $unc$one person be responsible
i dont think that they could be objective in every case every time
right
you know what i mean
right
this topic is kind of mute
yeah
theres no way
we couldnt survive in a trial system without a jury
right
$unc$one man $unc$one woman can never be objectionable in every case
thats it
every person has their opinions
and thats why jury selection is often very difficult
i feel the other thing too
they were saying what new ways could it change the system
i really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught point blank in the crime theres no question
right
its beyond a reasonable doubt
all these things
weve gone through this over and over again
right
they shouldnt allow an appeal
and it can go on for $unc$ten $unc$twenty years
yep
i think this is a little ridiculous
uh-huh
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
thats right
i work for a law firm
im serious
and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today with plea bargaining
right
if someone is ill
plea bargaining is a different story
plea bargaining is something completely different
that actually prevents trials or at least speeds them up
i know
thats what im saying
but i think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard
people who commit crimes that they
i dont know how it works exactly
but they get lesser sentences
right
and i understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something
right
but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
you know what im saying
that a lot of states dont have capital punishment
right
and i think they should
we do
and i think if a person is guilty of taking someones life and like you say theres no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people
and all
right
theyre caught dead to rights
i just think that theyve taken a life
and they should pay for it with their life
right
when youre saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned
yeah
we just have the case
im sure youve probably heard of $unc$marion $unc$berry
uh-huh
his last appeal was denied $unc$two days before his sentence was up
really
so his appeal was denied
and $unc$two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession
it
yeah
but that was absurd
there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a $unc$six month sentence
i know that
uh-huh
and i dont know
what would you do to change it to make it better
the only i wa-
the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of
like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence thats absurd
theres no way that could work
yeah
i dont agree with that at all
but
imagine the guilt that person would have
burned out
exactly
theres no possible way that you could feel good about yourself
exactly
right
if you had to do something like that day after day
no one would want the job
no
not really
and like i said everyone has their opinions about every case
do you think people should have a trial is theyre caught dead to rights like
yeah
i feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury
that right s-
supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you
were there witnesses
in other words youre saying that you have to find out whether its premeditated or what the circumstances were
right
right
that you cant remove the jury regardless of the case
yeah
you could have $unc$fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
yeah
and theres still mitigating circumstances
i
okay
ill let you start i guess
yeah
im employed by a company that does do random drug testing
and ive got some very definite opinions about it which havent changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it but developed a little more i guess but havent changed that much
what about you
are you involved at all
no
im not
my employer does not do that although i had an ex-employer that
the previous job i used to have they
i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
yes
i dont know
my feeling is that when theres immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs id be willing to support that
for example train engineers
yeah
because there was an incident several years ago where an $unc$amtrak engineer
right
he crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana
and i guess air traffic controllers i wouldnt want them to be on drugs and airplane pilots
but in that regard where its not an immediate threat to life and limb or property i would seriously question it
yeah
so
yeah
yeah
thats mine
it
i go back
to me no matter how much our company claims its not a constitutional issue that because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government
its not
the $unc$constitution doesnt apply
but it seems to me that it still should
our companys doing it because theyre a government contractor
and so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts
so its the government thats mandating it to a certain extent
okay
and our company has taken that and gone all the way
say
okay
first off we dont have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they werent
so well just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even
and
yeah
i-
then
and they
so its a complete random testing
its random in the sense that you dont know when
it is not random in the sense that they have said that within $unc$three years everyone in the company will be tested
and i sit at a terminal and write software all day
it certainly has no life threatening capabilities in my job
right
and
and yes
i agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening
and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper
i-
yeah
yeah
i agree
theres also the issue of
out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results
or i shouldnt say high
i mean several percent
yeah
that i will give credit to our company for in that i think theres a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs
and essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some
its not quite that simple
but its fairly simple
kind of a coarse kind of test
coarse kind of test
and then theres a much more refined test spectrography or whatever its called the chemotography to determine exactly what the things are
is that done
right
and
now let me ask you this
at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any
no
ive been with this company for $unc$sixteen years now
okay
so this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
and
no
and it has
they did that $unc$three or $unc$four years before they did it with everybody
and at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you dont know
but on the other hand someone new coming in that knows theyre going to have a test
with regard to jury trials i really feel as though whatever system has been used historically in particular jurisdiction is really the only kinds of things that you can use because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law
and if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases that would be handled differently were they judged by todays standards
so i really dont think they can really do much of anything to change it
what do you think
i dont think so
possibly in the jury selection would be the only
just for example what were seeing in $unc$california i guess
it makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome
wont
maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
but then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
uh-huh
and the other $unc$two guys sat in the car
thats bad
uh-huh
and they didnt get beat up
no
it
$unc$rodney got beat up because he involved himself in some self-destructive behavior
uh-huh
and just like the burning and looting is self-destruct
uh-huh
everybody says this is the nineties
yes
and theyre going to rebuild
and itll be even better
hey what do you think
some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area
thats right
with everybody with that mind set that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto
theyre only going to suffer
and you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site
theyre only going to suffer
theyve defeated themselves with their looting and violence
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that arent black or dont live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the tape
and
everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
and were going to reexamine this thing
hey the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed
theyre a bunch of animals
how can you really deal with an environment where youre going to lose everything
$unc$forty deaths
there are $unc$forty people that are dead as a result of that
i know
yeah
its really ridiculous
and im just trying to determine how you weigh $unc$rodney getting the hell beat out of him against $unc$forty deaths
against $unc$forty other people being
yeah
and theres no other
im not exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths
and im very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because im interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
those deaths
uh-huh
is it a looter that got shot by a store owner
i
no tears
or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what
yeah
but i suspect a number of them
you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street
or beaten
and my reaction is i would have run over $unc$fifty people rather than stop
and there would have been just nothing but carnage after if id been at the wheel
no one would have stopped me
right
thats exactly how i feel too
they wouldnt have stopped my car for anything had i seen them coming
but i was just wondering since youre back east and a little closer to the bigger cities than we are in $unc$idaho here
right
im inside the beltway
oh
how they always say inside the beltway they think thus
and i say wait a minute
im inside the beltway
and i dont think like that
uh-huh
im a government employee
oh
in what section of the government do you work
im with the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i
oh
thats interesting
yes
and the reason im doing this whole thing is because $unc$rick whos another government employee wanted segments of my speech that were done a year ago
uh-huh
and he wanted another collection a year later
oh
and so this is my seventh call
a year ago i did $unc$eleven calls
i see
and so thats why im religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique situation here in that if i dont participate
around here we have a program where we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
and we keep the newspapers in a
theyre collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin thats picked up and sorted out into a truck
so they actually have about $unc$three passes at this collection $unc$one for the regular trash $unc$one for the bottles and cans and $unc$one for the newspapers no they do that on the truck they separate them as they dump them and $unc$one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there and i think theyre running out of the sanitary landfill i think is running out of course you being from $unc$new $unc$mexico youve probably been to $unc$washington especially if youre your present location you must have come to $unc$washington at least once
sounds
but i gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
uh-huh
yes
yes
i know
not only have i come to $unc$washington but i find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar
that is we also have blue bins
we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here
and in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by
my youve got a lot of nothing out there
a-
they got
theres got to be a crevice between $unc$two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill
ah
but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
what unique things you think that you can do about it in $unc$los $unc$alamos
yes
other than nuking it
in fact $unc$los $unc$alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general
it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
thats pretty upscale trash situation
i dont think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals
and the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special polymers that have the ability to make certain actinide elements adhere to them
theyve looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and $unc$e $unc$s and $unc$h considerations that people are worrying about i think much more than they should
ive been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable
we-
back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center
and in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper
thats certainly getting into the swim of things
i think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy
everybody gets $unc$five pounds of garbage that they can throw away
but more than that every week youve got to pay by the pound
i think theyd be very careful about how they bought stuff
i think thats a wonderful idea
the only alternative i would see is and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybodys garbage would be a real pain if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
uh-huh
and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more
yeah
uh-huh
and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
of course those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
my exercise program consists of
its a opportunity to stay alive really instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth
im
and what i like to do is i like to stretch out
and i like to run m-
i like to run get my heartbeat up
i like to run about $unc$two and a half miles
and then i like to work out on the $unc$bailey $unc$life $unc$cycle machines up here at the $unc$holiday $unc$spa
and i think that
ive had a regiment now for about $unc$ten $unc$fifteen years of doing that
and i kind of think its a lot of work
but i think its a lot of work
but i think its the amount of effort thats required to stay healthy
i have a sedentary job
and unless you do something like that youre going to get sick
right
yeah
i need to get
im pretty bad about that
im lazy
i should i know
i always say that i need to start running
and im going to try and do that this summer
because i never have time
i always put it off
by the time i get back from classes its late at night
and i dont feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever
because im getting a gut here
i got to get back into shape
$unc$two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
and ive got
i figured itll go away
ive had to reduce my program
and ive gained $unc$fifteen pounds
and so its e-
i need to get back into swimming instead of running
i cant run i should be able to swim
im such a terrible swimmer
and i really feel i can dedicate about an hour and $unc$fifteen minutes to this effort
but if it gets longer than that i start not doing anything
yeah
so i got a real problem in that regard
it
do
you obviously are not an exercise buff or else youd be out there doing it
yeah
i do it i guess
im going to do it because i want to get in shape
its not something i really enjoy all that much that ill probably
once i get into it and if i get into better shape then it wont be as much of a chore to me
its always a chore
i started doing this when i was about $unc$thirty-five
yeah
and now im $unc$fifty-five
yeah
and i just know that im going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense
some health related thing is going to blow me away
thats the same way
i got too much weight on right now
i need to lose $unc$fifty pounds
right
i need to lose at least $unc$twenty
but its just im busy
im doing a lot of traveling
and it creates a problem when youre on the road
what other programs other than say running
have you ever done anything at all
yeah
i have
sit-ups
or also last summer i was doing $unc$nautilus
or last year im belong to a club right here
uh-huh
that was a little bit too much money
but doing a mix of $unc$nautilus and free weights i like that
what club are you with
im sorry
what club were you with
its called oh what was it called $unc$city $unc$sports downtown $unc$washington
okay
so youre downtown
yeah
i go to $unc$george $unc$washington $unc$university
okay
yeah
youre down there on twentieth and eighteenth and $unc$f $unc$g
yeah
its $unc$plaza
oh
id
theres a $unc$holiday $unc$spa down there on $unc$k street i think something like that
but i go to the $unc$holiday $unc$spa here in $unc$alexandria
and thats pretty good
but evening time it gets pretty busy
but generally i can get in and get a program
right
but i need to rededicate myself to doing this
and i got a problem ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it
ive been doing this for $unc$fifteen $unc$twenty years
yeah
and i know its going to bite me in the ass
and so i really dont want to back off on it
yeah
its something
i think im young
i should get started getting into shape
i dont want to
i want
at $unc$one point its going to be too late to do it
no
when youre young you can abuse all your systems
and you can recover
yeah
when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye
and so the object
your turn
i start
okay
we keep a budget to an extent
and we were really forced into keeping a budget because im paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid
about yourself
i have to say i really dont have a budget
both my wife and i grew up in families of rather modest means
and our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say
and were both so frugal that we really dont need a budget
we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing
yeah
i guess that really is sort of keeping a budget
you stay within your means
we stay within our means
but we dont do it by conscious effort
it just sort of happens automatically
yeah
we just moved to $unc$california
and the cost of living here in $unc$california is i would say rather pathological
yes
housing prices are from $unc$four to $unc$ten times more expensive than they were where i came from in $unc$dallas
you moved from $unc$dallas to $unc$san $unc$francisco
yeah
so that presents a real shock
that is a hugh difference
yeah
actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since weve moved to $unc$california
but
but you have good sour dough
and its a beautiful place to live
yeah
its gods country
yeah
and $unc$one way you know that is that only $unc$god can afford it
so budget is not a problem for us
at least it hasnt been
it may be at this point
but up until this point it really hasnt been
when i was in undergraduate school a long long time ago i noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers in my discipline was like $unc$six $unc$hundred $unc$ten dollars a month or something like that
and i noted at that point that if thats what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever
so i stopped worrying about money
yeah
and it
never have worried about money since then
thats a system too
sometimes its a bit of a problem because i guess i dont really manage my money the way i should
but i suppose ive lost money on not taking good advantage of investments
but
then again you said you are able to take trips
and you do obviously have enough to live on
so i guess youre indirectly budgeting just bye-bye the fact that you said youre both very frugal in spending the money
uh-huh
so thats a form of budgeting i would think
its kind of a strange topic for $unc$two people who dont really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
i guess were both lucky in that regard then
yeah
how big is your family
we have $unc$one on the way
i see
my wife
and then were having $unc$one on the way in $unc$september
how
once you get $unc$ten children though you may have
no
i think its just going to be $unc$one
all right
how about yourself
i have $unc$two kids
$unc$one $unc$nine and $unc$one $unc$thirteen
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point
do they budget at all
do you have them on an allowance
i give them an allowance
and they
i basically give my son $unc$ten dollars a week
and i put half of it in the bank
and i give him the other half in cold cash
yeah
and he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank
but at least it isnt burning a hole in his pocket
yeah
if he wants to use it he has to go get it
and that usually
capital punishment i guess out in $unc$california has had a lot of discourse in the paper
apparently they havent executed anybody since $unc$nineteen $unc$sixty-seven i believe
yeah
thats as far back as i can remember
thats before my time actually
yeah
they
we lived in $unc$redwood $unc$city when we were out there
uh-huh
and we found that it was a very liberal kind of community
but i really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars
and then these lawyer groups get together
and they i think extend beyond the normal appeal process and just drag his ultimate demise out for $unc$ten or $unc$fifteen years
and i think that theres something that has to be changed in the system to do that
i think capital punishment was probably stringent enough
but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
uh-huh
do you feel as though there should be was more you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment
i think that currently the way the law stands isnt so much that the laws are enforceable or not
its more theyre not enforcing the death penalty itself
its at that point where theyre saying here youre going on death row
but youll stay there for $unc$twenty years
uh-huh
and nothing is being done about it
the laws exist and are frequently upheld in $unc$appeals $unc$court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find
and its really getting out of hand in many states
the term technicality
the law enforcement community has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous acts are done to get somebody into a situation where theyre going to be guilty of a crime
and whether the rights of that individual have been impuned
or whether a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it
but the merits of the case in terms of the guy was a law breaker as being supportive
im at this juncture
im not sure what constitutes a technicality
thats what all these hearings are about
and thats what all these court cases are about
our glorious mayor here in $unc$washington is $unc$six days away from getting out of the can
and he tried to appeal his conviction
and it didnt work
but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry
in the old days and say round about times of battle of $unc$hastings the villages if you were a transgressor they either drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody
and you were his slave
and if he didnt like what you did he killed you
and thats pretty effective
its not good for civil rights i guess
but its pretty effective in that youve got to get along in the community
and if you dont youll perish either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods
as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially murder cases and that sort of thing
it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didnt the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off
for instance theres a case a few years back where someone whos was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that the arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights
uh-huh
and where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
a lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users
uh-huh
and i know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government
uh-huh
and i quite frankly dont see anything wrong with it
i guess im not a good civil libertarian
and i feel that if youre a drug user you have a hidden agenda thats difficult unless you really go into a deep background
of course were
being involved in my organization we have deep background checks
but sometimes drug use can escape that
sure
sure
and i have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to figure out who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy to break this activity
uh-huh
of course if hes fallen in love with drugs
and there isnt anything
but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope
yeah
whats your feeling
i guess im probably a little more toward the other direction
i guess mainly because i
theres $unc$two sides to it i guess
$unc$one is that if youre coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever even if its smoking inhibits your ability to function then i think that i dont have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot
but i guess i feel more like whatever youre doing in your own private life is your own private business
and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go
we had prohibition for awhile
and then we didnt have prohibition
weve had i guess laws against various other forms of drugs for the last what $unc$sixty or $unc$seventy years i guess
uh-huh
maybe a little longer
i think the first morphine laws were like or $unc$nineteen $unc$ten or $unc$nineteen $unc$five something like that
yeah
$unc$eighty years or so
yeah
yeah
so i
its hard i guess for me to justify what seems like basically a breach of the freedom from search and seizure on something that may or may not stand as a law $unc$fifty years from now or even $unc$twenty or $unc$ten
who knows
the thing of it is that is in many respects just i think an over simplification
prohibition certainly didnt last
i think theres so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits
but you got to look at prohibition though
you had the same problems there right
yeah
they support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that
yeah
yeah
sure
it goes back to that again
if you look at prohibition because its illegal it costs more
if it was legal
face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what $unc$ten or $unc$twenty dollars an ounce
i must admit that
and clearly if youre into coke and all you want to do is snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap
and youd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
yeah
but yeah
get
yeah
i must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society
yeah
yeah
thats why theres people dealing it because theres money in it
theres ridiculous amounts of money
but i think that being in law enforcement i probably have a kind of a draconian philistine attitude toward it
but i really feel as though the interdiction effort is
as soon as you get rid of $unc$one goon thats involved in drugs and tha-
yeah
interdictions hopeless
yeah
and then another $unc$one will jump up
theres no way youre ever going to win that
but we see
the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is
thats a losing fight
yeah
as soon as we wind up for
if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand
but people want to get stoned
yeah
yeah
and i dont see that
yeah
it goes back to what can society impose on people
can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen
yeah
i dont think you can
was raised with being a very strong $unc$bible work ethic
so im $unc$one of these $unc$ten $unc$twelve $unc$fifteen $unc$twenty hour a day type people
uh-huh
so yeah
i can really relate to
yeah
everybody ought to do their own share
i dont have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because theyre too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
uh-huh
but
when youre with a big company or a big organization a lot of times the benefits are good
and the pay is regular
but sometimes you dont get tuned in to whats going on
and i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know whats going on
and maybe thats probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do
whats your feeling about benefits
what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company
since im kind of on the older side i just feel like when i start talking about benefits im concerned about medical benefits
my husband works for $unc$mcdonald $unc$douglas
and so his medical benefits are so excellent
thats really great
uh-huh
i work for a bank $unc$western $unc$financial
uh-huh
and they dont let me know really about anything thats going on
even some of the immediate things that i need to know i dont know it until the next hour
and all of a sudden we know weve got changes made
were changing departments
were changing policies
were changing doing other kinds of things which to me is disturbing
i feel like if i dont necessarily need to be involved since im pretty much on a low level
you are right there
im pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned
but i do kind of like to know whats going on and whats happening
and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if i had a little bit more information along that line
th-
i work for the government
and actually i work for the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i
my gosh
and so theres lots of things that we dont get told for good reason
but basically theres lots of things that we should know about projects
im an engineer
uh-huh
im a cotr
and sometim-
and i worked in the same lab with a guy
and we didnt really know that much about each others projects for $unc$two years
and we should have
were now collaborating
and
and it
for $unc$two years we didnt which was kind of stupid
but our organization is doing something else on $unc$monday
for all unclassified programs were having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways
and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting but that sort of thing
yeah
that is interesting
but i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand whats going on
exactly
but of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know
and if you dont really count if youre not part of the program you might not get told for months
or you might if it doesnt impact you directly or if your management doesnt think that
but regard to benefits most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing
in the private sector i would think that $unc$one of the major situations especially when you reach the mid-fifties is keeping a job until you retire
a-
right
and engineers are baggage as they get older to most companies
and its very much like the military
it windows out
you think boy im getting more money
and im getting more responsibility
im doing this
but as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
uh-huh
and pretty soon somebody falls off
ive fallen off twice in the private sector
and i can get up
i know
it seems to be kind of scary because you think of
my sons $unc$eighteen right now
and he wants to go into engineering
and the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open
and hes interested in basically $unc$three different areas
but its difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that
he needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows whats going to happen in another $unc$thirty years
uh-huh
yeah
and in $unc$thirty years it becomes pretty critical
my brother-in-law hes $unc$sixty
hes not ready to retire
but his company is closing up
uh-huh
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on hes getting cut back
and hes not ready to retire
yeah
he may be retired
budgeting activity in our household is kind of an informal kind of situation
we put
actually what happens is my check gets automatically deposited
i dont even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore
it just gets deposited
and my wife looks at all those bills that come in
and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them
and so our budgeting
we really dont have a formal budgeting situation
every time ive ever tried $unc$one ive just got wrapped in my inertia
and ive just decided not to pursue it
whats your budget situation
actually ive had a couple of different situations
my current $unc$one has been the most successful
at a certain point in life
an- my ex-husband was an alcoholic
and we got divorced back in the mid-seventies
and that left me with $unc$three teenagers
actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets isnt it
it certainly is
but at any rate what happened was that i just absolutely put away all the credit cards
i didnt rip them up
i didnt send them back
nothing
i just put them away
because there was $unc$one that it was really handy to have
if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it
uh-huh
but mostly we just spent cash whatever we had
and if we didnt have it we absolutely didnt spend it
but then as things improved
once i got them all through college it came to the point where
my parents came through the depression
im not sure how old you are
my parents too
you were born in the late thirties or early forties
but my
late thirties
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house
and thats kind of the way i was raised
and so im not a very demanding person in that aspect
for quite a period of time i just flat didnt spend any money
meanwhile i had a building bank balance
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there and not ever have to spend any money on interest
uh-huh
thats good
and thats the way ive operated ever since then
it
and if something goes on sale and i dont have the money i still dont buy it
we buy what
we just got through buying a $unc$twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
my
and we put $unc$twenty-eight $unc$hundred dollars on the charge along with my trip to $unc$japan which was $unc$fourteen or $unc$fifteen $unc$hundred dollars
my!
my
right
we got a monster bill coming in
but we also have $unc$zero interest being paid
and we pay it off as it goes
uh-huh
and thats the way i do my credit cards now
yeah
so we never really get that much over extended
yeah
i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards
but its the fact that i have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full
yeah
were doing that
we have
this is our big
we did redecorating
$unc$two new pieces in the family room and new carpet
weve just been spending spending spending
my
im envious
i
but we havent really done anything for a long time because weve had $unc$two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year
uh-huh
we dont have that
its time for you to do these things then right
yeah
its about time that we did that
and it all looks still pretty good to me
why we need to replace it
but unfortunately my wife really feels as though its just been an inappropriate thing to
that rug is $unc$thirteen years old
why not replace it
i say it might go for another $unc$thirteen
but too late well never find that out
this is so funny
thats wonderful
but youre lucky to have her because if youre like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it
and
certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not
i dont spend that much money
we just sort of have had too many obligations to
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school
and that was the major decade of expenses
so we feel as
but as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate
when we want to go out to eat we go out to eat
we never really have to program money for that or make choices
but we dont have that uproarious a lifestyle
after all were
okay
go ahead
i think public service is a worthy thing
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as $unc$peace $unc$corps that promote that
uh-huh
probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
i know that because my son is a scout now and is thinking about his $unc$eagle
and in order to get $unc$eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
right
and you have to do a public service project in which leadership is the key element
uh-huh
i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because its talking about a requirement for public service
uh-huh
and of course the $unc$peace $unc$corps the $unc$boy $unc$scouts is a voluntary activity
right
i think that might be referring to something kind of alternative to the draft
either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years
right
of course military service falls under the category of a public service
right
right
and so $unc$one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
right
right
but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended
there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of
i-
uh-huh
right
but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either
more of a voluntary kind of thing
yeah
or
yeah
yeah
i-
for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school
uh-huh
kind of in lieu of the draft for people who are conscientious objectors or dont otherwise want to be in the military
okay
you can go into the military
or you can do this other thing for $unc$one or $unc$two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things
and its interesting because im not a particular fan of the military
but i have seen a lot of young guys go in that dont have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and arent terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do
and they come out
and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline
and in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can see that if i do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot
and its a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they dont need to be cowboys
they dont need to be out there constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
and for some young men thats good
for me it would have been lousy idea because i did have the personal discipline
why
and i went to college for $unc$four years and got out
why is that
but for some people thats good
i dont particular like the fact that its the military
and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as an instrument of $unc$u $unc$s policy
no
no
no
its to defend the nation against external evils
thats $unc$one view
and thats another debate
but its
it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military
uh-huh
right
right
and it seems pretty aggressive oriented
you look at the last military action which was in the $unc$persian $unc$gulf and wasnt anywhere near the $unc$united $unc$states
and it was definitely a projection of $unc$u $unc$s power on the other side of the globe
so at any rate this is getting off the topic
but i-
my point was that for people who dont want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the $unc$boy $unc$scouts
ive been involved in electronics a long time in computers
and i have really resisted the impulse to get $unc$one for the home up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago
yeah
i got $unc$one for my son a $unc$macintosh $unc$l $unc$c
uh-huh
its a real easy to use color computer
and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it
and he uses it for his school work
uh-huh
im currently in school
so ive had an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m clone i guess for a couple of years now which ive been continually upgrading i guess
and ive found that i pretty much become addicted to it
and i cant really
ive found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis
so
huh
its very essential for me
schools have them
but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school
its much more convenient to have $unc$one at home
where you going to school
at $unc$georgia $unc$tech
i see
yeah
so
in engineering
yes actually
so that explains all the computer assignments
yeah
it
do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work
sure
i have some games of course which i play on there
and i have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank
so i can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby
so it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on
so do you have a computer for yourself at home
no
no
i just have $unc$one for my son
and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing
yeah
yeah
tha-
at work im a technologist
and i in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming
but now i find myself using the computer
even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
do you use $unc$email and like that
yes
emil probably pulls down a third of all my time
yeah
its
i have modem night computer
so i can log into the network at $unc$georgia $unc$tech and access my account through there which can be useful
but yeah
that and word processing is
while i tend to
obviously i do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether its term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
uh-huh
so its i dont know really become my mainstay i guess
i cant even remember
i dont think ive ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a basic computer $unc$t $unc$r $unc$s $unc$eighty when they first came out
uh-huh
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high
so
im a old-timer
i did my masters thesis on a typewriter
yeah
i rented an $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m $unc$selectric
oh
and it was a pretty big deal
yeah
it must have been tough
its a little bit strange for me
i did my masters thesis last year
and i did that on a computer
and it seems like
i just cant imagine how people did it before
it must have been just so much work
yeah
it was just a completely different world then
yeah
so you used your sons $unc$macintosh then
do you like that kind of computer
i like it
yeah
i like it from a distance really
i see the packages on it that are available
and its nice
i really dont use it myself
uh-huh
when i come home from work i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
yeah
huh
so i let my son do it
and of course theres an intellectual evolution taking place where
yeah
its sort of a joke
but its really true
the old-timers even the people who are technologists dont know how to operate these electronic things like v c r and whatnot
and the kids they just take to it like candy
yeah
if the interface is there so that its fun to use and the challenge
regarding taxes i
taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society
but really people get upset at taxes because its more efficient to do things yourself
right
and so as a result its a trade-off for the common good for the benefit of others
how much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others
have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really dont deserve it
yeah
i know its a lot that i feel just like you said that theres just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you dont need the money for
but theyre giving it to other people that dont really need it either
but yet they accept it
the thing of it is if i wanted to just permanently become a book reader i guess i could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me
like so many people do
uh-huh
and probably a good woman
right
right
just con somebody to take care of me
and then you dont have to be on the tax roll
right
but taxes are very difficult kind of thing
and everybody really hates it
it was very timely
i always over pay my deductions
so i wind up getting money back from my withholding
uh-huh
thats always a smile
but of course ive paid it in
and i should calculate it better
right
you are you in business for yourself
no
i work for the $unc$f $unc$b $unc$i
so im a federal employee
right
yeah
guess i dont sound like it
i th-
no
i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else unless you work for $unc$internal $unc$revenue
yeah
i belong
ive got all $unc$four feet in the trough being a federal employee
yeah
but i can understand who gets benefits
every time there is a bond issue i vote no on every $unc$one of them
uh-huh
right
i
but this is not tax revolt country
theres too many
most of us have all $unc$four feet in the trough plus our snout right up to our ears
yeah
so its not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation
right
but the local taxes here in this particular area i think i pay about $unc$thirty-five $unc$hundred for taxes on my $unc$four bedroom house which is a lot of money
right
and so as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing
uh-huh
and theyre building old peoples homes at tax expense
i think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where its cheaper
at $unc$thirty-three $unc$hundred dollars or $unc$thirty-five $unc$hundred dollars im paying in taxes
i could go down to $unc$bulverde and probably rent a house for that
right
yeah
thats right
instead its the taxes here
so
yeah
course i dont know whether i want to go to $unc$bulverde or not or $unc$seguin or someplace like that
yeah
yeah
but theres certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer
and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer
if youre not going to use them then you want to be in environment
thats a strategy i think that the people have to take is how to be able to lessen their cost of living
im $unc$five or $unc$six years before im eligible to retire
and im saying i really cant stay here as a retiree
after you retire
yeah
its too expensive
yeah
im going to have go out in $unc$east $unc$fork someplace and do my thing
right
my parents are in the same situation
their home is paid for
but still their taxes are so high that my father doesnt feel like he can retire because they couldnt pay their taxes
and they have no children in school or anything now
they dont use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards
right
they redecorated in $unc$nineteen $unc$seventy-five
yeah
and theyre not doing it again
yeah
so its certainly
you must be a $unc$t $unc$i employee
you must be what
you must be a $unc$t $unc$i employee
no
im not
youre not a $unc$t $unc$i
who do you work for
i dont work
im a student
i go to school
im in nursing school
youre
okay
generally i get most of my news in the weekly magazines like $unc$time $unc$newsweek and $unc$u $unc$s $unc$news and $unc$world $unc$report with occasional smatterings of the $unc$wall $unc$street $unc$journal and of course the local paper
uh-huh
but my only complaint is i really dont enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper exhaust the details
so thats why i concentrate on weekly magazines
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as youd like
yes
i dont think i have the time to really become a student in every article
uh-huh
and so i like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of whats going on
uh-huh
but many times the local news kind of suffers
but here i am cheek by jowl with our nations capital
and
thats right
youre very close actually
its almost a bedroom community for the capital
yeah
yes
exactly
when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway im saying to myself hey guys im inside the beltway
but it turns out that the $unc$c $unc$n $unc$n i think is great and for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
uh-huh
but generally theyre more sound bitish kind of thing
and i dont really feel as though ive a gotten sufficient dose of news that way
yeah
a lot of my information comes from several sources
probably pretty high up on the list is $unc$national $unc$public $unc$radio which i like
uh-huh
yes
i think its fairly objective
and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative
and while theres an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read i always figure its a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side
thats potential indication of balance
and generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced
i also read $unc$time magazine
and we get $unc$one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section
and
the $unc$mercury and the $unc$chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there
oh
you st-
did you use to live around here
$unc$redwood $unc$city
i use to work at $unc$anteks
okay
yeah
okay
i know exactly where that is
$unc$anteks $unc$amdahl and places like that
yeah
we get the $unc$mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
yeah
a-
the newspaper i really been impressed with it when ive read it at times the $unc$los $unc$angeles $unc$times which ive found to be a very good quality newspaper
uh-huh
and i like a lot of the articles there
we dont have cable t v the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called $unc$c $unc$span
yes
i enjoy
we have both $unc$c $unc$spans here
but really on the public t v $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer is an hours program that i always
both
uh-huh
if i watch any news program it will be $unc$macneil $unc$lehrer and occasionally $unc$c $unc$span
uh-huh
i saw the tapes that were run of $unc$marion berrys drug bust
the whole thing was run on that
and also they have the parliaments question and answer period
i never say that
that would have been interesting
it
yeah
i think thats always fascinating
i wish we had something
when it first tuned in on that i
its $unc$one thats
i think it was somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person
and i
and everybody was making noise in the background
but its usually the $unc$prime $unc$minister
right
heres this dude in a wig
$unc$thatcher
$unc$major
and i said to myself its another $unc$monty $unc$python that i didnt know about
and then up jumps $unc$margaret $unc$thatcher off her green bench
and i said its $unc$parliament
which could be another of $unc$monty $unc$python
yeah
so i thought to myself i cant wait
im going over to $unc$britain in $unc$mid-may
im going to approach my
this is how i discovered the $unc$prime ministers question and answer period
p-
i have seen that
and aside from the level of wit which is much higher than generally in $unc$american politics which i really enjoy i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard real questions i think
and its unlike the fairly controlled press conferences that $unc$presidents of the $unc$united $unc$states have here where they always seem
yeah
i dont think im in the majority in $unc$texas
i dont think i agree with
really
no
you dont believe in it
i wouldnt say that
i think i would have said that a few years ago
when i was younger i thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didnt have capital punishment
but maybe slowly changing my opinion
yeah
im not thoroughly opposed to it
i still think its sort of true that a more civilized society wouldnt have to use capital punishment
but im beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought
you sound a lot like a friend of mine a girl i hang out with
uh-huh
she has very black and white opinions
theres no gray in her opinions
she probably would agree more with you
but i dont know
i think i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again
ive never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
uh-huh
but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what theyve done
yeah
and we see that more and more
in our state right now theres a $unc$fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a $unc$seven year old girl
uh-huh
thats $unc$fourteen years old
whats he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
yeah
i certainly dont advocate turning people like that loose
yeah
im not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail
but
no
it doesnt
but it costs less
yeah
thats a factor
and yeah
to me it is
i work and i pay my taxes
and i lived out in $unc$texas for a little while
and theyre
and thats a pretty heavy state compared to $unc$georgia
you guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in $unc$georgia
right
but even in $unc$georgia thats the attitude for the most part
if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and wed get along just fine
uh-huh
yeah
but when ive got to work to pay my dues and your dues then i dont like you very much anymore
yeah
yeah
i
the cost is something
but i think its relatively unimportant compared to whats the most effective way of dealing with crime
and i guess i would like
i dont know
the $unc$european countries certainly none of them have capital punishment
and they dont have a crime problem either
really
no
you cant
they dont execute anybody in $unc$britain or $unc$france
and i dont believe they do in $unc$germany or $unc$italy either
and they dont have the crime problems we do
i dont really think that there is too much of a relationship between the $unc$two
yeah
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is when i see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing
and that bothers me
you might be right
but it
but
id hate to be the person to pull the switch
i would never in a $unc$million years want that job
huh
but i do believe its necessary
and i
yeah
on the $unc$one hand i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i couldnt stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
huh
and i couldnt pull the switch
but
i wha-
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i dont really think its a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else
i think it just becomes a symbolic im tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians
so
yeah
i would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed
right
like i said some years ago i think i would have said theres no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country
uh-huh
now im not so sure of that
i wouldnt vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
whats making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
i guess im
my view of
my
im beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that costs and other factors justify executing people
yeah
maybe its more a symbolic gesture than anything else
and ive also never been a victim although i have $unc$two friends whose wives were murdered
and i can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
gosh
yes
if it ever touched my fam-
i dont know what you drive now
what do you drive now
i have a $unc$ford pickup
and the family car is a $unc$dodge $unc$caravan because we have $unc$three kids and theyre under $unc$thirteen
okay
so
throw them in the back
they sort of fit our requirement
yeah
i have $unc$one of those pickups with a seat in the back
cab
yeah
and so they just fit in there
when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work
yeah
right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room
and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back
there you go
and i kind of like having a pickup truck
yeah
yo-
i think of it as a car thatll last
right
yeah
i know
i like the way trucks are built
and i dont care about comfort
so im pretty happy
yeah
youre looking at
i got a $unc$toyota $unc$four $unc$runner
i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too
so i got a $unc$four $unc$runner
so i wouldnt hesitate to get another one
i never buy new
so i wouldnt hesitate to get another used truck
youre just like me
ive never bought a new vehicle in my life
and yeah
i dont need to pay for the glitz
ill let somebody else have the showroom shine
no
and ill pay for the rest of it
let somebody else break it in
right
right
and the van were sor-
we might go again on a van
we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
im not sure
yeah
well have to face it in a couple of years
but i guess we had a small $unc$toyota wagon
right
and we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance
right
and it certainly had that
we didnt do much to it at all
yeah
yeah
my
pretty much the same
i got $unc$one of those $unc$toyota $unc$four $unc$runners
uh-huh
and it pretty much does everything i need it to
itll tow $unc$three $unc$thousand pounds
so i can tow everything
and it
i can throw
ive had $unc$eleven people in it before believe it or not
uh-huh
and its real reliable
belie-
ive had it for almost $unc$four years now
and up until say $unc$two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
uh-huh
and then of course $unc$two weeks ago it decided
i dont know
its the strangest weirdest thing in the world
but it blew a head gasket
uh-oh
didnt do any damage to it
i caught it real early
how
at how many miles
$unc$ninety-seven $unc$thousand
huh
so its not real early
you didnt overheat it
no
never overheated it
i smelled the coolant
uh-huh
went out and looked
saw where it was coming from
drove it right to the shop and left it off
huh
that was
and that was it
because i have that
and then i have a $unc$kawasaki motorcycle which is usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and its not raining
uh-huh
yeah
thats sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle
its a
i dont know
people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves
i have $unc$one colleague that commutes to work on one when its not raining
and hes a
its
hes pretty conservative guy
i dont think its much of a sport for him i guess
i know
but i bet you he really enjoys riding it
im sure he does
yeah
yeah
so yo-
h-
when was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving
yeah
no
and i go out twice a week on the bike at least just for the enjoyment
yeah
yeah
but yeah
the only thing i think i might get not necessarily a new car but another car
i would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one ive got just because theres a lot of times i wished i had just an open bed to throw stuff in
right
im sure that thats very
you got $unc$one
thats really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
and
if i only had some place that i could store the camper top i would have it off most of the time
right
i really leave it on there just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty
to have it out of the way
right
but theyre solid
trucks are built
i think they last a lot longer than anything else
theyre the only things $unc$americans still know how to build
and
yeah
yeah
the trucks do
even though the little $unc$jap trucks are good there too
but so are the
though i think the $unc$chevies
i dont think the $unc$che-
i dont like the $unc$chevies as much as i like the $unc$fords
yeah
i think the $unc$fords tend to last a little longer at least until recently
right
i kind of like mine
yeah
so mines a $unc$ford
a friend of mine just bought a year ago its a really nice truck
i dont like $unc$dodges at all
but $unc$one of the $unc$dodges they have out now has the $unc$cummins turbo diesel on it
i heard about that
yes
its beautiful
yeah
that thing will last forever
thats a serious truck
yeah
that things
its got a boat engine in it
right
this
i know a contractor who just got $unc$one of those
uh-huh
hes pleased with it
i havent had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care
when my $unc$two year old was in $unc$new $unc$orleans she got bit on the cheek
but thats about the extent of it
but when
i really am concerned that so many of these child care places are coming under investigation for child molestation
uh-huh
and im saying to myself you dump your little turnip off to this child care place
and they dont pay very much
and why would they be interested in your little turnip unless $unc$one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is thats somebody to molest
uh-huh
and thats a terrible kind of thing
and i dont think my children have ever been subject to that
but my wife didnt work
and so we really didnt have that much exposure to it
uh-huh
i am a working mother
i have $unc$three children
and my children since they were very young
ive had various different alternatives child care arrangements
and like most working mothers im really not defensive about it
i personally feel in our particular situation im a much better mother when i work out of the home
and my kids i think are very secure well raised children
my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities
huh
so i e-
it is a problem
but as you pointed out i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities
and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford
when our children were very young we had a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful
huh
and then as they got older they went to i preferred to call them schools
and they were really all day preschools
and they were wonderful
and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
thats interesting
but we really truly did pay a fortune
we were paying at $unc$one point about $unc$five $unc$hundred dollars a week for $unc$two children
my $unc$god
you must have just $unc$one hero ace professional job to support something like that
i mus-
im a physician as is my husband
yeah
and i felt very good about working
im a pediatrician
uh-huh
but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
and we all know the kind of things that youre supposed to look for i think
not all of us
the kind of things youre supposed to look for
im an engineer
and
i think its real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that theyre always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
and we had a really wonderful arrangement
im with the university
uh-huh
and they had a wonderful program that started at age $unc$three
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work
and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing
and they had wonderful
they had things like gardens and lots of pets
and they had a $unc$four to $unc$one teacher student ratio
yeah
so that sort of an
most of the teachers had degrees
$unc$five $unc$hundred dollars a week for $unc$two kids
yeah
thats incredible
it was incredible
but it was good
it
at that time there were $unc$two children
and they were in special programs
and each one was a little over $unc$two $unc$hundred a week
and then in addition i paid a little bit extra
but the kids were
they really had some great opportunities
but tha-
w-
what you were alluding to earlier is women who work for minimal wage and really feel they have to put their children
yeah
sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying situations
they could
somebody will have a job at $unc$three $unc$hundred a week to get off welfare
and thats a good starting wage
uh-huh
but boy $unc$three $unc$hundred dollars a week doesnt go very far on child care
uh-huh
no
even that really i think i dont
its been awhile since ive looked at
my youngest child is $unc$eight
so its been a little while since ive looked into daycare centers
but they are
huh
the good ones do cost maybe $unc$sixty dollars a week since
we used to pay $unc$fifty cents an hour to baby-sit
but mine are $unc$twenty-two $unc$twenty-three and $unc$twenty-seven
so that
uh-huh
i guess baby-sitters now are up at what $unc$five dollars an hour
something like that
my
but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children
it has been a real
there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences
and i think they have captured a certain market
again the
but then there are baby-sitting groups
as a pediatrician $unc$one of the things weve been real concerned about is the infections
uh-huh
as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around
yeah
i
in this modern day and age it seems like we have more and more leisure time because we have so many appliances and whatnot
we dont even have to cook dinner anymore
yes
yeah
really
but i dont know this for a fact but ive heard that a lot of families really dont spend a great deal of time together
the kids maybe on the average get something like $unc$thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
thats what ive heard too
it seems bizarre to me
i dont quite understand it although i think probably the worst thing thats happening at least the modern world today is television
yeah
not so much because its bad $unc$per $unc$se although there is some pretty crappy programming
and theres also some i think poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time
right
its so darned easy to turn the thing on
i know it
i tell myself sometimes just sit down after work
so i refuse to have $unc$one in the house
really
yeah
good for you
good for you
i talk to a lot of people about that
and ive thought about it myself
and i though about it a lot
uh-huh
but i still havent done it yet
thats good
ill tell you
television sure makes child rearing easy on you
the kids can be a real pest
and turning the t v on is almost like magic
its like sticking an electrode into their pleasure center
and you dont have to worry about them
thats true
ive noticed that
but i dont think its too good
i dont think so either
so i dont know
i take advantage
i dont have a great deal of time to spend with the kids
but i take advantage of dinner time
we always eat together
and whenever youre with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them
do you keep your kids active in sports or anything
or
i guess our big outlet is music
okay
our $unc$thirteen year old son plays violin
and our $unc$nine year old daughter plays cello
okay
and when our son started playing violin i took up violin
and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello
so theres plenty of interactive time in practicing although neither kid likes to practice
i guess thats not a big surprise
no
not for kids
but i imagine with infants most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them although
yeah
i try and read to them
and i take them to the park and stuff
reading is so good
i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
yeah
they get to that stage
but i read
theres this $unc$doctor $unc$seuss sleep book
have you ever seen that yet
sleep book
no
yeah
its called a sleep book
and you ought to get it
i tell you i read that book to my kids so many times i almost have the thing memorized
weve got quite a few of $unc$doctor seuss books
yeah
i think his sleep book is my favorite
really
uh-huh
yeah
i like to do it
and they enjoy reading
i never read a lot growing up
and i never read until a few years ago
i just started picking up books
and so ive found that its really important to me to get to read
i like to get away in a book
uh-huh
uh-huh
and so ive put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and
uh-huh
so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day
i probably spend an hour or $unc$two
thats great
my wife works at night
so she does $unc$tupperware
so shes gone a lot at nights
and so i spend a lot of time with them
i see
how old are your kids again
theyre $unc$two and $unc$one
$unc$two and $unc$one
uh-huh
yeah
so you have your hands full with them
thats for sure
yeah
i try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair
that is really a sore spot with me
i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving
but $unc$ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least $unc$u $unc$s automobiles was pretty dismal
and not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
uh-huh
and it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
yeah
but i
so do you have a car
pardon
do you have a car
at that time i had a $unc$volkswagen $unc$rabbit
uh-huh
and it was a real lemon
subsequently i got a $unc$buick $unc$century
and it wasnt as bad
uh-huh
but last year i bought a $unc$honda $unc$accord
and i take it in once every $unc$seventy-five $unc$hundred miles for its periodic maintenance
and that is it
and its wonderful
yeah
we used to have a $unc$honda $unc$accord
and theyre good
theyre really good cars
every time i get taken to an auto repair place every time i go i get taken
bad
woman goes in
and they go all right we got a sucker
lets see how much money we can get out of her
thats what happens every time
so
what do you have
i have a $unc$pontiac $unc$six $unc$thousand
all the more reason to have a $unc$honda
yeah
but our $unc$honda just got old and just wore out
it was lets see $unc$eleven years old
and it just out of it
so you bought a $unc$pontiac
huh-uh
my ex-husbands
this just happened a couple of weeks ago
hes my ex-husband
but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car
and everything is wrong with it
the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks
now thi-
how old is the car
$unc$eighty-seven
and he just doesnt take care of things
but i was awarded the car
so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic
and i can trust him
so he is trying to get things fixed on it
but its just leak leak leak everywhere
but i hate to go into a repair place because theyll tell me something is wrong with it and its not and charge me twice as much
the last time i took it into a repair shop
the man told me i needed a master cylinder
so i said okay
and he charged me a $unc$hundred and $unc$thirty something dollars
and then about a month later a man was looking at my car
and he asked me
not a repair man but just a friend
and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on
and he looked at
and he said thats not a new master cylinder
and i didnt even know what one was
and he showed it to me
and it was old rusty just awful
it was no more new than nothing
so apparently it was the same $unc$one that was on there
more than likely
probably filled the brake fluid up
and that was it
that was it probably
it was ve-
i was so irritated
and thats happened to me more than once or twice just about every time ive went in somewhere
so whats the solution to that i guess find a reputable service
and you can hardly find $unc$one
the guy thats doing most of my car now goes to my church
and thats the only reason i go to him because i know him
uh-huh
and i know he will tell me the truth
because he doesnt even charge me for doing it
so hes not going to take me
right
i just pay for the parts
and he does it so
thats wonderful
yeah
youre lucky
yeah
i am
so i dont know
i dont know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car theyre usually the worst $unc$one of all
we took our $unc$honda to the $unc$honda dealership
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
really
yeah
and so idiots as we were neither $unc$one of us knew much about cars
they told us we just had to have $unc$one
and we bought $unc$one
we didnt no more need no new engine
give me break
so it was not good
and
i think im fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation
and for me theres absolutely no question whats the most important benefit i think its health care
right
its what
i think everybody would say that
and if you try to get it outside of your corporation youre going to pay an arm and a leg
right
belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
right
the
sometimes i think its more important than salary
do you also get dental
yes
and i dont know if i would rank that second
but since i have $unc$three boys it can turn out to be important
yeah
i know
in a given year dental expenses can really kill you
my husband is with $unc$northwest $unc$airlines
and he gets the full health and dental
and we have $unc$four children
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
right
and i dont know how people that dont have it can afford it
right
its
or maybe they dont
right
and then if the cleaning doesnt get you the orthodony will
thats right
thats right
i guess that would be up there
im not sure how i would rank that compared to retirement
or pretax savings was another thing that i think is a great benefit
uh-huh
right
and i think its really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how were not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like $unc$four percent in this country and $unc$fifteen percent in $unc$germany and $unc$japan
right
its a lot easier to save it when you dont get your hands on it first
right
when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldnt otherwise do
right
and
what about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation
for example
leave
yeah
do they have father leaves or anything like that
i dont think so yet
they may have just plain parental leave which either one can take
uh-huh
i know their maternity leave is on the order of $unc$six weeks which i think is too short
i do too
i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
i think its just a crying shame for a mother to have to go back to work at $unc$six weeks
right
and
she isnt recovered
and the infant needs her desperately at that point and time
there
there ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time
uh-huh
right
i agree
its so important to families then
and yet anybody whos gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
sure
especially in this day and age
that
you dont want to start over again anywhere
yeah
youre right
i think youve put your finger on the $unc$one benefit that i would most like to see changed the parental leave
i think theyve come a long way at least some companies some of them my girlfriend in particular that works for a rental car agency
right
and as manager they have a very very poor leave policy
and i just dont know how women do it
particularly single parents who dont have the support at the other end
right
they do it by shortchanging their kids
theres no other way unless theyre part of some extended family which is unlikely
thats right
thats exactly right
right
people moving as much
and its just a terrible choice
you shouldnt have to make it
uh-huh
youre right
and
$unc$one of the benefits we get of course is travel
right
boy
would i like to have that
its wonderful
yeah
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
but you cant afford to stay once you get there
listen i have friends in a lot of different cities
if you just fly me there
ill take care of that
thats right
you have to have an awful lot of fun
just getting there has to be half the fun
right
and i guess the
and you say you have some strong feelings about the issue
yes
i do as far as immigration as a whole goes
uh-huh
i think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
uh-huh
i
there just is not going to be room for all of us
we dont have jobs now
i think when we come to a time of recession that its particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
i hope youre $unc$one of the employed right now
uh-huh
i am $unc$one of the unemployed right now
i was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company
and i applied for $unc$one set of jobs with a company here in $unc$dallas that they had $unc$two $unc$hundred openings
but they had $unc$two $unc$thousand applications
yeah
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work
uh-huh
and of course im not perfectly happy about not having a job
right
how do you feel
im a little bit ambivalent
and i think $unc$one of the problems with immigration policy like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it
theyre not willing to tell the truth the same way with issues of race and things like that
right now i believe there are $unc$two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration $unc$three actually
$unc$one is at the high end
they always want to be able to do some brain draining
they always like to be able to attract the $unc$einsteins or the $unc$professor $unc$chou
or
right
theyd like to be able to get the top people in any field
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
at the bottom end they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
those are $unc$two things that i think are going on although i dont think the politicians would tell you that
okay
and i think youre right in both cases
and then the third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in $unc$mexico
they cannot close off the mexican border not because its physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in $unc$mexico would spill over to this country
so they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam
and i think probably its pretty important right there
how do you feel about haitian immigration
thats $unc$one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with $unc$pat $unc$buchanan
i think theyre a very difficult group to integrate into society
theyre very difficult group to find jobs and places for
and so i dont deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that theyre pretty miserable where they are
but im not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of $unc$haitians in
i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
yeah
and it would have nothing to do with political situations
it would have to do with poverty
right
but if you let them in a $unc$million at a time it wouldnt make that big a bulge in the population but politically and economically
my gosh
have you been to southern $unc$florida
yeah
i know about it
it is now with $unc$haitians the way it was with $unc$cubans $unc$twenty years ago
and the $unc$two of them together
we can
its just as well
its hardly $unc$america anymore
on the other hand the ironic thing about this is that theres nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant
so theres a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
but theres some differences in the immigrants that were getting now
i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
right
sure
i think probably a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
right
but the majority of the illegal immigration were getting now they do not come here to blend into $unc$america
they dont bother to learn our language
and first of all they
i really feel strongly about this
uh-huh
we send a lot of money to $unc$mexico
uh-huh
why dont you start
i dont know
i refinished a couple of old dressers that were handed down
its nice tongue and groove construction
ive been pretty successful with that
things you already owned or things that youve picked up just to do that
what
are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing
no
ive done some other things too
yeah
ive done both
yeah
my wife has picked up a couple of things saying if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture
and weve done it a couple of times
i guess that weve been fairly successful with those
yeah
thats a kind of low risk sort of project isnt it i guess
yeah
thats a good way to get started
i have a really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated it after a fire
uh-huh
and we stripped it all the way down and refinished it
and it turned out to be a nice desk maple top i think or something of that sort
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i put together a rolltop desk from scratch
really
a kit
im jealous
yeah
still had to cut it and everything
but it was fun
uh-huh
yeah
i do things that might be too crude to be called woodworking
ive built my own deck and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
ive done the same like the trim around the house the baseboards and things like that
and i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too
i picked up a bunch of $unc$craftsman tools from the forties that my wifes father owned when he was alive
uh-huh
and so i do have a band saw and a router and things like that out in the garage
but i cant say i use them very often
yeah
im looking at trying to get a router right now
they come in handy at the most unusual times
putting doors in is the time when im
i bought myself a template for making mortices and doors
and thats a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
ill bet
but ive also used them for rabbeting because rabbeting on my radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
uh-huh
so i got $unc$one for $unc$christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first $unc$eight months i had it
and now i use it twice a year maybe
yeah
my brothers used it a lot for making drawers
i dont know
the big
whats your opinion of what a good router is like
i
i guess it
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in arent all that great
theyve plastic parts and stuff
the ones that what
that you dial in on the side
i have never even looked at $unc$one closely
the little use that ive gotten from my router i would spend my money on the bits
uh-huh
uh-huh
i have id guess youd call a medium quality $unc$craftsman router
and the
how strong is it
its strong enough for any job where you dont try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time
but the problem is that as with
any time you buy as a package the bits that they give you are low end
dont they
uh-huh
uh-huh
so a good set of bits is probably going to run you a $unc$hundred dollars
and if youre going to use for a lifetime i suppose its worth it
because e-
i imagine if i go and sharpen them myself they wont last
and ive never had the bits sharpened
so thats a thing to consider is to
uh-huh
they really get hot dont they
yeah
and they dull after awhile
especially i did some cabinets in ash and oak
uh-huh
and that wears a bit down
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
uh-huh
right
and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of $unc$one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth
and routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
so
yeah
ive cut some $unc$one by $unc$eight oak before
boy was that fun
right
thats
big solid pieces of oak are just tough
and then you take the blade to get sharpened right
that was with a circular saw
uh-huh
my gosh
right
is this going to be fun
yeah
ive used mine on treated wood
and now all my blades need sharpening because treated wood will also chew them up
yeah
treated wood can really make you sick too
what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
i dont know
what do you think
i dont know
i had a little bit more time to think about it
i was thinking of
i dont know
i started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that have who knows how much stuff about all the purchases that youve made and everything kept tract somewhere
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i dont know
i dont know what they actually have in there
but i know they sell those
what about required drug testing as a condition of employment
yeah
that was the other one i was thinking of
i think thats
i know drugs are illegal
it thing actually
i have worked at $unc$texas $unc$instruments
uh-huh
and they instituted a drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees
uh-huh
and to tell you the truth i really did not think much about it
i hadnt
it really didnt relate to me
but there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have
uh-huh
and also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity
and yet a lot of these large corporations such as $unc$texas $unc$instruments although they dont admit to it a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
uh-huh
so what that means is to me that really its the government thats requiring this
although they dont actually execute it themselves its really the government that
so in that sense at least philosophically its really borderline legal
uh-huh
i think that a persons competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior
and if theyre on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them
i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a chemical
what about this aids epidemic now
where you find that certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others
these people that are carriers and that dont reveal it
yeah
and of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesnt
it destroys their libido
yeah that would be kind of an extreme
if they ever
ive heard of things like marking them somehow or something like that or putting them all someplace like in a kind of
so what about that as an invasion of privacy
yeah
i guess it kind of borders on what do you value more the invasion of the persons privacy or the possible danger to other people
so really
it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society
yeah
i guess thats been the big role of government i guess generally
its supposed to have been
yeah
yeah
thats kind of a difficult one to go into
i mean that particular case
no
it
because theres a lot of people that they could require obligatory aids testing for everyone because theres a huge part of the population
not a huge part but a
a growing part
the aids population i guess that have it that dont know they do are spreading it
uh-huh
but again to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things
i dont know
i dont know how exactly i feel about that
maybe chop their weenies off
yeah
i guess its an easy one for me
i think theres something seriously wrong
yeah
what is it that you are particularly upset about
i think theyve lost their compass
and im not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore
but i voted with my feet
and my kids go to parochial school
uh-huh
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldnt get in the public school system
$unc$one $unc$hundred percent of the customers care
thats $unc$one thing
everybody cares about the education the kids are getting
and they take an relatively active part
if youre sending $unc$two $unc$thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate
and you can influence the way things are
so youre saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes
and consequently theyre not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way theyd like to see them happen
yeah
the immediacy just isnt there
uh-huh
and i also think that $unc$one of the problems
and i think this is a cultural problem
the problem with public education is really a problem with the culture
and i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like $unc$california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school
and you cant get a tax levy passed
people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because they dont have kids in the schools
right
i think thats a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasnt our kids
i think thats the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem
and theres an immediate problem
right
it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at the national level
right
yeah
it means that youve got to be informed
and youve got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision
yeah
i believe that the original idea of public education in the $unc$united $unc$states which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution
it barely made it
i think it was added afterwards
i think the principal was education for civic participation
right
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter
and you couldnt pull the wool over their eyes
right
it has taken on a more profound
and youd think wed notice it economic thrust
yeah
thats exactly what i was going to say
now there seem to be really $unc$three reasons for education
$unc$one is education for civic duty
$unc$one is education for economic reasons
and $unc$one is education for civilization
and i think that one
im glad that you added that one
yeah
i think that ones significant
thats what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor
and then i quit and got disabused of that notion
but the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs
and im not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is
and im really sad to say this
i never thought i would have
but i really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem
and thats why i guess im sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs
right
i agree with everything that youve said so far
and the only that id want to add is that im a little more in contact i think with public school teachers than perhaps you are except as a parent of your child
and the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing
and they are the $unc$three things that you mentioned
but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related
right
thats what
like consumer
kids too
yeah
you laugh
how many
what ages
$unc$twenty-seven up
and we had $unc$five
youve been through the fun part
yeah
and how about yourself
i have a $unc$four and a half and a $unc$three
oh
so its
im sure theres a lot of differences in the way its done now and then
yeah
when mine were growing up i did some traveling but not that extensively
but i always just made it a point to spend about $unc$ten minutes with each $unc$one of them
yeah
so it was an hour
yeah
but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
what was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest
$unc$six years
so they were all real close
yeah
thats tough
thats a lot of time
yeah
we look back and wonder how we did it
did you both work your wife too
no
she never did
qualify that
she worked at home im sure
yeah
yeah
but thats
both my husband and i work
and sometimes i feel like by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening
yeah
maybe $unc$thirty minutes max
thats plenty though
and he spends a lot of time with them while im cooking
and then i spend time with them while hes doing other stuff
and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend
theres a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it
but its neat
its straight
and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids
yeah
right
with kids youre not going to have a neat house
ive accepted that too
and its tough to find time especially with both of them working
thats true
it is
yeah
thats true
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it
thats true
and we do a lot of that on the weekends
we try to spend $unc$saturdays together
right
if my husband golfs hell do it during nap time things like that where theyre not really missing the presence
right
and we do a lot of family things together
were kind of going the other direction this weekend
were planning a trip just he and i
this is the first time weve gone anywhere without the kids since she was born $unc$four and a half years ago
thats good too
yeah
thats good that way too
i decided that you need that once in awhile that you need to plan the quality time
and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you dont have to be there $unc$twenty-four hours a day
yeah
they say all it takes is about $unc$five $unc$ten minutes a day
yeah
and as the kids got older i made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too or whatever
sure
sure
and
and they think thats a family activity
yeah
yeah
thats great fun
and yeah
if
my daughters like $unc$mommy can i help you with the laundry
of course you can
yeah
just keep them talking that way
absolutely
yeah
but another thing we used to do is have family councils every $unc$sunday night
uh-huh
and what would you do
what
discuss everything that didnt agree with them
and wed take turns being president
oh
and everyone would get $unc$one vote
and i always thought wed get outvoted $unc$five to $unc$two
yeah
but it never worked that way
so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
yeah
and we could bring up stuff too
and then
oh
and that was always good time
we really got to know the kids well
i imagine
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
yeah
in fact they were all in over the weekend for $unc$easter
i
thats wonderful
i was raised in that type of family where you dont disobey me you mind me
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it
we did too
yeah
and i remember the $unc$one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
uh-huh
and she said i dont make fun of your friends
so why make fun of mine
kind of hit us between the eyes
yeah
yeah
you dont think of it that way do you
no
but that was always good quality time for us
now thats good
i like that idea
and then never attend
but if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
whatever was voted on
yeah
and boy theyd show up
i think thats great
and wed usually take notes
yeah
and the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at $unc$one time or another
yeah
but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us
and they loved it
i think thats true
i can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment
yeah
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done
yeah
so i do think its right that theyre harder on themselves
yeah
but boy i feel for you and your husband
why is that
$unc$two of my
how do you feel about it
i dont see any problem with testing for random drugs
yeah
i myself almost am in favor of it
i work at $unc$honeywell
and i dont know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i was brought on
uh-huh
i think thats pretty standard
at least at $unc$honeywell it is
i think its important to insure the quality and i dont know almost the goodness of character that kind of thing
yeah
where do you work
im a graduate student right now at $unc$carnegie $unc$mellon
okay
okay
and i just came from $unc$saint $unc$paul interviewing with $unc$three $unc$m
great
and they have a policy for testing
if they make you an offer then theyll test you right before you start
right
and i guess the only drawback i can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
uh-huh
yeah
but i-
yeah
and that definitely happens
the drug tests sure theyre accurate
but theres always that margin of error
yeah
and thats something to be aware of
another thing is a lot of times they arent that accurate
they arent that sensitive
if youre on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that
yeah
i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for $unc$honeywell
and i know they didnt catch that or else they would have said something
im sure they screen for just a particular few types
although the literature they give with you says we do this
and then they list about $unc$five $unc$thousand drugs they try to test for
right
i dont know
what program are you in over at $unc$carnegie $unc$mellon
electrical engineering
okay
great
yeah
im a graduate student at $unc$u $unc$c $unc$f in $unc$florida $unc$university of $unc$central $unc$florida
wow
and this is actually an internship up here
but even for interns they do or the whole drug testing thing
so
they test you before you start or before you even interview
right
or
they essentially
no
i sure dont
they essentially made me the offer and then did the drug testing thing after that
so it was $unc$one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests
and then they essentially give you the offer
uh-huh
and then at that point theyll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
oh
so theres some noise on this end
im actually in a mall calling
so
oh
you probably wondered
but
yeah
what happens if you were to fail
then do they give you $unc$one more chance or $unc$two more chances
yes
thats a good question
i believe from what i remember of the literature if you fail i believe they give you $unc$one more chance
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
uh-huh
but once again those things are not that accurate
so theres undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail
but wha-
are you working right now anywhere
or
no
okay
im just about to finish my masters in $unc$may and just interviewing with companies right now
okay
great
yeah
that was the first time id ever gotten any kind of drug screening was going to $unc$honeywell
a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there
uh-huh
and hes doing an internship with $unc$i $unc$b $unc$m
oh
and they basically did the same exact thing
we both got our internships at the same time
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time
so $unc$one of those things where we went through kind of an identical process
but
do they test you right now at work too
no
no
thats $unc$one thing they dont do is drug testing while youre on the job
okay
i think the unwritten rule is expect it
but they dont do it
oh
so thats good i guess
i dont know
i have gone to a couple of parties since that time
and while i dont do any drugs myself ive seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever
uh-huh
and thats the kind of thing that would definitely come up
but no
they dont really do that
so
wow
is it formal policy that they said they might test
yeah
how do you feel about the crime in your city
is it
$unc$minneapolis isnt too bad
i know that theres been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
uh-huh
thats kind of gone up in scale and some other things
i personally had a little experience the other day
somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck
really
but when you look at $unc$minneapolis as compared to where i used to live its really quite a bit better because i came from $unc$florida
uh-huh
and in $unc$orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever
so
yeah
what part of $unc$california are you from
$unc$san $unc$jose $unc$california
really
i have a good friend there
here the real problems are the gangs
yeah
a lot of murders just in general the whole
weve only been here a couple of years
before that we lived in $unc$colorado
but in comparison to $unc$colorado its real noticeable
yeah
uh-huh
i can just sense
i wont go to the grocery store at night
yeah
yeah
thats
you know
and its that kind of thing
and
thats really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like
yeah
we have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort
sure
do you have that where you live
or
interestingly enough right before i moved up here
im an intern
and then i go back down in $unc$may
uh-huh
but in $unc$orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it
weve been broken into in my apartment about $unc$four times in like $unc$two and a half weeks
no
and $unc$one of the things that i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there
uh-huh
because they were just
its $unc$one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work
uh-huh
and then the houses were left unguarded
but yeah
i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it
thats a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch
yeah
also ive heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time theyre home like on the weekends
is that right
a high percentage of free time
i think its like $unc$fifty percent of most peoples free time is spent doing yard work outdoors
oh
so they wait while youre outdoors
they know the house is unlocked
and then they just slip in slip in slip out
thats amazing
they know exactly what theyre going for
yeah
so ive heard thats really on the rise as far as a new type of crime
yeah
it almost seems like theyre getting quite a bit smarter
yeah
really
unfortunately yes
yeah
unfortunately its starting to really look at peoples habits and where they are at particular points of the day
uh-huh
yeah
$unc$one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at $unc$minneapolis because hes from $unc$detroit
uh-huh
and the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced
uh-huh
but yeah
i guess
i think weve got a neighborhood watch program here in $unc$minneapolis
im not real sure
yeah
it helps to know your neighbors
they give you
youre supposed to make lists of cars
i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car thats unfamiliar we have a list
is that what you did in your program where you have a list of license plates
pretty much
yeah
yeah
i was basically involved in that in the organization of it
uh-huh
and then i left right in the middle of it
im not sure where we went from there
uh-huh
but
yeah
yeah
that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that sure
uh-huh
you hate to be paranoid
but there are really only so many things you can do
you can have the house alarm neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night
yeah
yeah
you can do that which is what i choose to do
yeah
$unc$one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
yeah
even if you know that the threat is there its against the law to set traps
uh-huh
its against the law to do a lot of things
they could basically
when i was getting robbed down in $unc$florida i was really considering electrifying doors things like that like
uh-huh
thats
uh-huh
they did in $unc$miami that time
but its not
if you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home its considered self-defense though
thats not always true
it isnt
no
there was a case about $unc$two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed
uh-huh
and essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home
uh-huh
the guy came in while he was home
and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned
he didnt die
but he was severely burned
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
really
yeah
so that makes you think
yeah
its like your hands are very much tied
yeah
i think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasnt premeditated you had a handgun its the middle of the night someones down-
ive had $unc$three boys through i guess some child care each one of them
and now theyre in school
so its all over
but i guess i would say its not easy to find what most parents would want
i can profit by this because im due with my first in about $unc$three months
is that right
i guess the only rule i can think of is that i like to look for places with good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that
if theyre associated with a college or a university theyre usually a pretty good bet
i think its sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something
youd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
i guess not
usu-
i suppose youre absolutely right there
yeah
for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully
uh-huh
but when my kids were young i was teaching at a university
and the child care center associated with our university was quite good
so i felt confident that theyd do right
uh-huh
of
dont everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their pet theories or some such thing
yes
but yeah
i suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that theyre pushing $unc$one form of education or another
i guess thats true
but i never had bad experience in that respect
of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents
and they
pretty good people
the thing i really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about
uh-huh
and youd just feel awful if something like that happened
yeah
i never really worry very much about it
i tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public
so i never really worried too much about that the case with my boys
uh-huh
oh
i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them
but
uh-huh
i dont think its as common as the newspapers would make you believe
uh-huh
and another thing is cost
yeah
i mean that
i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now
and in some cases theyre finding its just not worth it to work because its all going out in daycare
right
in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school
and im really happy we did it although it was very very difficult
and i think it was the right thing to do
and we just decided that we would do it
and we went ahead
but not everybody can make that choice
and even though my wife wasnt working we did have $unc$one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on
so we did look around
i think my wife is much better than i am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not
so i would always trust her judgment on that
im just thanking heaven
my husband just got a new job
his last company he was only working $unc$four days a week
uh-huh
so its
and he just got a new job
hes getting lots of overtime
he got a pay raise
and so im just grateful that we dont have to worry so much about my working or not
theres absolutely no question that youre going to be the best child care provider for that kid
so do it as long you can
i suppose
but i think you have to look through a place
and you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the main thing is that you have to determine that theyre perfectly open that youre welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth
and if theyre at all queasy about that then id look elsewhere
you have to start wondering if they dont want you
yes
right
you have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care
i have $unc$one
but i havent really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
uh-huh
but i really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems
uh-huh
i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
this is true
yeah
current affair can get several shows child cases
uh-huh
why dont you go ahead and start
okay
i think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury is good
but a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which i dont think is all the time good because sometimes its hard to get all the facts and to prove a person guilty if you dont really know or you dont really have an eyewitness
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me
i dont know
so you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
i think so
i attended a trial in $unc$germany when i was a student
and thats the sort of system they have
uh-huh
the trials are held by a panel of $unc$three or $unc$four judges who are
theyre lawyers i guess
theyre experts in the law
right
and there really isnt a jury
and they do the questioning also
the judges do the questioning
and they
uh-huh
i-
i think its a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury
but im not sure i like that
i think i prefer the jury system myself
you think you prefer the jury
you think your chances are better
i think in most criminal cases it wouldnt make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury
what i worry about is cases where its the government against the individual
thats where you really need a jury of peers because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens
thats true
i think thats really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is there ought to be a
i guess i dont think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time
uh-huh
i think maybe a judge is a better judge of that
or
sometimes the sentencing is not fair
the jury i guess they do decide that
but im like you
in a case like that most of the time its
i dont know
maybe im too conservative when it comes to that
the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases
yeah
if you drag $unc$twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someones guilty or innocent
thats usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
right
but people who dont have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for $unc$one case on $unc$one person based on what they see i think that is maybe a little bit naive
yeah
in $unc$texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
uh-huh
its kind of a hanging jury atmosphere
right
but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way
but i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it
some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
really
i kind of like that system
yeah
yeah
thats not a bad system
but i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
yeah
but the thing is too maybe they need i dont know more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick $unc$joe $unc$blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in
yeah
right
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
exactly
i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
right
exactly
insurance cases and things like that
yeah
where
and there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of peoples heart strings and making them cry and feel like theyre doing somebody good by giving them $unc$two $unc$million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
uh-huh
exactly
exactly
so i think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government
but
have you had that experience recently
i cant really say recently
but i think about a year ago i bought a product from some company down in $unc$atlanta $unc$georgia
i believe it was $unc$one of these mixers these juice machines
and the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked perfectly okay
yeah
but i found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after
oh
even despite diligent washing it got rusty after about $unc$three weeks of use
and i dont think it was my fault because i had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it
but it was
i had to send it back after the third week because i realized it was not
something was very very wrong with the blade
what about you
i dont have so much trouble with products as service
uh-huh
i dont feel like thats as big a problem
ive had a few answering machines over the last $unc$two years just because ive had a lot of trouble with them working correctly
uh-huh
and im not convinced that any of them work a $unc$hundred percent
uh-huh
the $unc$one i have now is okay most of the time
uh-huh
but thats it
but thats probably the worst
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her thats guaranteed $unc$james $unc$avery
i dont know if you have that up there
but its a very good company that sells sterling silver things
uh-huh
and she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
and when she stood up it caught and broke
and we took it back
and they said this was just obviously yanked
uh-huh
this was yanked
they were so rude about it
right
and so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said its not guaranteed
and i said put it on because apparently nothings guaranteed
so do it anyway
uh-huh
so we got the kind we wanted
and i was really disappointed with that
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
uh-huh
and i happened to need a birthday present for $unc$one of her friends
and i called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice
and i said my goodness
i said youve been very nice whats your name
and she told me
and i said i really appreciate it
i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
so
right
so i felt kind of good about that
i didnt even know the persons name that had given me the hard time or anything
uh-huh
right
but i just felt like at least i did something
maybe theyll fix it
they might work on that
right
right
but i find attitudes are more of a problem
service is more of a problem
i find
up here in the northeast we have these mail order companies like $unc$l $unc$l $unc$bean
and they are famous for i guess having really top-notch service
theyve got
really
i have friends and family who order from them because you can ive heard stories where you can literally buy something from them $unc$one year wear it for a year and a half
and even after like $unc$eighteen months of reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition
and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you dont want it anymore
theyll actually do things like this
they bend over backwards service wise for you
ive found also a lot of companies nowadays they have $unc$eight $unc$hundred numbers you can call
thats really great
i guess you can call up any $unc$eight $unc$hundred number directory assistance you can get the $unc$eight $unc$hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies
and ive tried that with a few companies lately
and most of them have been pretty good
but i was
$unc$one reason why i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that if you buy through $unc$bean or though
i guess $unc$one of beans big competitors is lands $unc$end out in i guess its $unc$wisconsin somewhere
theyre very good about insur-
huh
the customer is always right
and no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding
and they make sure things are set properly if youre any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
thats really good
it use to be like that
uh-huh
but
i dont think most places are like that anymore
nowadays with the economy the way it is i guess
there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are
things are getting rough out there
theres a lot of
the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn
the question was talking about the juries
and $unc$one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again
so that a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day right
right
i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed
i think that in some cases thats considered to prejudice the current case
right
so a judge youre right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there
uh-huh
and if theyre judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing
yeah
i agree with you
$unc$one thing i heard was this where instead of going to the regular court they have a mock court
its supposed to be all legal and everything
you go
and you present your case
the other side presents their case
and youre done with it
its almost like the night court we see on t v
uh-huh
but its not that we have such
it didnt backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending
so i
that was $unc$one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
in other words not
there would be some types of crimes for which youre not guaranteed a jury trial
yes
now
i dont
theres a point on which we dont agree
uh-huh
i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime $unc$one of the parties wants $unc$one
uh-huh
and usually it is the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
sure
so im not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that
that would require a change in the $unc$bill of $unc$rights i believe
and so
and i didnt mean that
okay
i didnt mean that no
because gee whiz if i didnt have that right not to have a jury that
yes i would feel youre right that my civil rights had been violated
but i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes were going to have a judge here
were not going to have a jury
lets get it over with
sort of like car accidents
right
i think thats all ready possible
yeah
i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial
yeah
right
so i agree that that should be encouraged
uh-huh
people should know that thats an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial
but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if its a civil case giving higher awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the award
right
giving a different sentence
uh-huh
the take
right
yeah
and i suspect it in cases like
i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil
is that right
were at liberty to talk and meander as long as its all on the same theme
yeah
uh-huh
in the case of civil things i think maybe the use of the jury is very often to the lawyers advantage
and i think that may be where jury use is overdone
there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently
right
but the lawyers are really
its to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
so i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases
uh-huh
uh-huh
im not so sure im in favor of that
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases
so theres a difference of my view there for those $unc$two
right
right
yeah
you can tell i havent been in too many judges chambers or anything like that
have you ever had to serve jury duty
n-
i was called once when i was $unc$nineteen
uh-huh
but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me
and i was doing school and things like
they let me out
uh-huh
an- ive never had to it since
and that was almost $unc$twenty years ago
uh-huh
it isnt
sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in
that would have been about $unc$twenty years too
just last year
and the case i heard was a criminal case
and it seemed really trivial
it involved $unc$two bicycles
we didnt do the sentencing
the judge did
how interesting
we rendered a verdict
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that was here in $unc$wisconsin
so i dont know if that varies from state to state or if it
im $unc$nevin from $unc$sunnyvale $unc$california
hi
this is $unc$jim $unc$bliss from $unc$minneapolis $unc$minnesota
how you doing
pretty good
good
i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it
yep
im ready whenever you are
okay
what are your thoughts on the subject there
i definitely think decisions have to be unanimous
yeah
yeah
i think thats probably a good thing
its probably the safest thing
yeah
its to easy to get a quorum
yep
and simple majority wont do
no
and even two-thirds majority its
yeah
thats
yeah
quorums are to easy to get
yep
and theres always that chance that $unc$one or $unc$two people could be playing devils advocate for a good reason
so its
definitely
but i dont know
i couldnt believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
yeah
gives them a little too much power
yeah
tha-
i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently
but
plus you may be doing a guilty verdict
but it may be for technical reasons
yeah
about the only good thing i would say about that is that it would hurry the process up a bit
yeah
but even now i know weve got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
and thats what the trial by jury
i know
jeez if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances whose to say
yeah
it
there would be much more of that
yeah
no doubt
are you involved in the legal system at all
no
but i tend to follow it just to know whats going on
okay
yeah
yeah
ive got some friends that are lawyers
so
yeah
i do too
so
$unc$one of them just got his law degree
but to tell you the truth im not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now
no
i really havent studied it in depth
yeah
i know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases which is
yeah
its more in how you present it versus whos right
im sure of it
because a lot of those things its largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better
yep
its kind of weird
i dont know
i always think about watching the peoples court or something and how weird those cases get
its just
yeah
you say okay we cant bring up this point because then theyre going to
the opposition will say this this and this and
uh-huh
and its like boy the stuff that they can twist around is
yep
its pretty amazing
and its like the truth isnt really important anymore
its
yeah
its not
and then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because
yep
this friend of mines pretty obnoxious
and he really gets into suing people
and so hell sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case its wasting peoples time and the taxpayers money and everything else
but
but
yeah
but its for the more general
people dont want to take responsibility
yeah
its
and most of the time theyre looking to place blame and stuff
yep
youre from $unc$california
is that right
yeah
originally from $unc$chicago
but
okay
i was just thinking
i wonder how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and where i am in $unc$minneapolis
i really
from what i understand its all pretty the same except when you get to $unc$louisiana
and $unc$louisiana is completely different cause what is it its based on common law
and the rest of the country is not or something like that
yeah
pretty strange
but fortunately i never have had to go in even for jury duty
yeah
i havent either other than
but that friend of mines telling me that i might have to go in as a witness
he may subpoena me
so well see what happens
but
im not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better
yeah
its
there are too many big problems
theres such a backlog of court cases right now to try to get them all in a good time
i know
and we already have too many lawyers as it is
yeah
and if its criminal cases you cant put them in jail because theres no room left
yeah
yeah
thats true
and in fact theyre even letting some go
yeah
im originally from $unc$florida
and it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they dont have room for them
thats not a good solution either
not at all
im not real sure what the
what do you think about capital punishment
im kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
yeah
which crimes do you feel that
i think first degree murder probably warrants it
yeah
because of
so many times its so brutal and just recurrent
right
selling i think should also
exactly
recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
yeah
i originally come from the state that has the death penalty
i come from $unc$florida
uh-huh
and theyre pretty liberal on it
they tend to fry people left and right which
yeah
thats
go ahead
go ahead
$unc$texas is too
$unc$texas i saw on t v the other night has had $unc$forty-six in like the past several years
yeah
so theyre pretty hip on it too i guess
they do it by lethal injection at $unc$huntsville
yeah
okay
i think $unc$florida still uses electric chair
yeah
i dont know
in some ways i dont like it because its like theyre playing $unc$god
yeah
and thats not
i dont think thats right
but on the other hand theres a lot of advantages to it
yeah
i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
yeah
with $unc$florida thats a big problem because theres so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year
they
yeah
thats whats happening here
there is
thats
in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
uh-huh
sure
and thats a big problem
but theres not a whole lot you can do about it because theres only so many jails you can build
uh-huh
and it gets to be a big problem
yeah
go ahead
i wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesnt
right
be a little more
not being able to put it off for $unc$fifteen years
uh-huh
yeah
because a lot of these guys they get in
and they get off for good behavior
and i dont know
up in $unc$minnesota where i am now they dont have the death penalty
and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system because they figure sure i get $unc$thirty or $unc$forty years for maybe rape or something
but then for
if i elicit good behavior im out in maybe $unc$five or $unc$ten
really
sure
goodness
just because like we said before they dont have enough room in the jails theres a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
uh-huh
yeah
but if youve got the death penalty hanging over your head
i dont know
i think that may solve a lot of that
yeah
maybe not solve it
but i dont know
maybe
i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient
yeah
kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
uh-huh
what do you do $unc$georgeanne
im a graduate student at the $unc$university of $unc$texas in $unc$dallas
okay
great
what program you in
audiology
okay
fantastic
yeah
what do you do
im a doctoral student at the $unc$university of $unc$central $unc$florida
really
yeah
im doing an internship up at $unc$honeywell
oh really
yeah
neat
but i dont know
its an interesting issue
you say in $unc$texas theres been quite a few
and in $unc$florida in the last few years i think theres been a lot
i cant give you figures
but
yeah
i just
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in $unc$california
uh-huh
so i think it
the $unc$forty-sixth in the last $unc$twenty-five years i think is what
is that right
they gave a run down that $unc$texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
okay
yeah
kind of ive heard things about that
ive heard that they dont mess around very much
yeah
they dont get repealed as easily as they do
the guy in $unc$california got $unc$thir- twice before he went to the gas chamber
and then they said no
you dont have to go
and then they took him back
it just seemed a little inconsistent
jeez
thats a lot of repeals
and then you have $unc$two
you have these people who are serial killers that didnt even get the death sentence back when ever
uh-huh
yeah
i dont know
im trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
i guess
whats the policy now with treason
do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence
no
i dont think the military doesnt execute anymore
so
yeah
or death before the firing squad or whatever
yeah
so i think about the only one is rape
okay
im here
how do you feel about public schools
our public schools are really poor i feel
uh-huh
im not sure where $unc$georgia ranks in the nation
but were toward the bottom
yeah
and theres a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong that you would think it would be easy to correct
uh-huh
right
but the system doesnt allow for the corrections
uh-huh
how about you
thats interesting
i have a sister who used to live in $unc$kennesaw $unc$georgia
yes
and she has a young boy actually has $unc$two boys now but only had $unc$one when she was there
and she complained quite a bit about their school system there
yes
and
and $unc$cobb $unc$county is better than the county im in
right
she was in $unc$cobb $unc$county
right
im
i cant really say much about the schools up here
i really dont come from here
uh-huh
im only up here temporarily on an internship
but i live in $unc$orlando $unc$florida usually
okay
and the schools down there from what i know are not bad
theyre pretty good
thats great
but i know in a lot of rural areas theyre not that good
uh-huh
for example i have a brother in $unc$north $unc$carolina
and he says the schools there are just terrible
i feel that were way behind
i have a son that is in the fourth grade
and they have just now taken up division
wow
yeah
and
that is slow
i-
e-
my husband and i go to the store
and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things
and i feel like there are several areas that were just really really slow in
uh-huh
and i dont blame the teachers as much as i blame the system
it is
what do you thinks wrong to cause that
for $unc$one thing theres not enough money in the school system
and the money they do have they do not use it wisely
yeah
my sons teacher has $unc$twenty-seven students
uh-huh
and thats certainly is a lot of students for $unc$one person to deal with on an every day basis
yeah
perhaps
but more than that i dont think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
yeah
and when you have $unc$two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and youre not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principals office it can really be bad
yeah
yeah
thats $unc$one thing i worry about
also i think we have a lot of $unc$hispanics
there you go
uh-huh
and we have a lot of
the county im in the minorities are mostly hispanic
yeah
probably quite a few black people up there
and
no
were from the county they marched in
were in $unc$forsyth county
is that right
yes
and we
and theres very few blacks
okay
so thats
i hate to say
its not a problem because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
yeah
but its
you dont want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever
but then again
but it is a problem especially in the inner city
yeah
there is no denying that
sure
you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who dont understand especially if theres not a very well developed special education program at the school
and you cant put all the children in special education
thats right
you cant do that
and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
right
i grew up in $unc$nebraska
uh-huh
and the school that i went to there was fantastic
it
i really consider myself very lucky
we had a school that had classes probably about the same size youre talking $unc$twenty-seven $unc$thirty kids to a class
yeah
but
but your teacher had control
yeah
we zipped right along
i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
uh-huh
yeah
i believe i was too
uh-huh
but youre right
with all this dont hurt the kids and dont abuse their rights youve also taken something away from the discipline i think
uh-huh
it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
yeah
we just cannot afford it
right
i was going to ask you if that was an option
if
are you in the middle of anything
no
im not in the middle of anything
ive just
about the last thing i did
about maybe close to a year ago now i guess i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
so i guess that
the whole thing
yeah
that was fairly large undertaking
its a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on $unc$one side of the house
did the framing and all
we did it all except for the sheetrocking
that was the only thing we didnt putting the ceiling up and things like that
we werent sure how to do that
and
and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
yeah
thats the exact opposite
we put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up
we just didnt do any of the sheetrock wall work
and thats it because you have get those joints to go together
ye-
and whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that
yeah
we didnt know a thing about any of that
and so it looked very hard to do
my wife wishes i hadnt done that
so
we figured just
i didnt think we could do it and make it look professional
so we left it to somebody who does it for a living
but
i think it takes about $unc$three or $unc$four times before it gets easy yeah
probably so
and wed never done it
so we just left it alone
but thats
i guess im only $unc$twenty-one
so my vast experience of home owners knowledge is not very much
so its just what i have to do more or less around the house for my parents
so
you framed in new square footage
or was it stuff that was already enclosed
it was brand new
brand new
we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
so it was
and you knew how to do the framing
my dad knew how to do most of it
uh-huh
wed gotten a couple of books
and then he just started doing it
i dont know
he did all the flooring himself
he put the whole floor in
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there
and then we put not necessarily a garage but just a off the side of that
after we had the house part made we just decided wed carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less
its not enclosed
its just somewhere to drive another car to park
and its
do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
its off the ground
on the piers
uh-huh
its on about $unc$twenty-two inch piers something like that
did
you had those poured
or you did them yourself
no
those are
we did those ourselves
so
you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete
yeah
exactly
so its
the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of
yeah
those are
ive done $unc$one
i helped somebody do $unc$one of those before
those are
you can buy them in kits
but we didnt do that way
but its
no
i designed it from scratch and did a pretty good job
yeah
those are nice
theyre pretty forgiving
you can always tear stuff out and redo it
its a
yeah
yeah
thats not near like building a house or anything
but
yeah
those are nice
especially when you get done youve got something
i dont know
i like them
you just sit down on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue
yeah
i built it $unc$two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and a backrest and all that stuff
or
i
yeah
that sounds nice
all done by yourself
i had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
designed
so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm $unc$four by $unc$four posts
and then the rest of it i just did
yeah
a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work
but it was pretty
it was about $unc$four or $unc$five $unc$hundred square feet
the same size as the addition that i just put on
so
yeah
thats a good size deck
yeah
so yeah
thats
its not that expensive
i think it cost me $unc$three dollars a square foot and no less than that
yeah
thats not
cost me about $unc$six $unc$hundred dollars all together
yeah
thats good
thats not bad at all
didnt have to
yeah
the wood may
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is
to get good lumber it costs
i dont know about $unc$dallas but even in this little town its not cheap at all
i was surprised
id be surprised if it wasnt cheaper where you are
its probably more there
yeah
it probably comes from where you are
yeah
yeah
it probably does
most
im not sure
but
when i drive through that area thats all i see is pressure treated lumber yards
yeah
its nothing but woods down here
yeah
i havent
i used to live in $unc$dallas in $unc$arlington actually
but that was just when i was a kid
so i dont really know what the cost of living is even in $unc$dallas anymore
but i dont know were a college town
so that doesnt help us out any
right
$unc$east $unc$texas
we have
gas is a dollar $unc$twelve a gallon
so thats probably about what youre paying
so
yeah
my current project is a walkway which im building around the house and out to the backyard digging it out and laying sand and putting pavers on top of that
so
yeah
thats a lot easier
youve got something going all the time
go ahead
have you every been tested for a new job or anything
no
i havent
but in my job im a nurse and we are allowed to be
this is the rules that they can do this anytime
i dont know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested
so its just sort of
they can if they
they can if they choose to
okay
right
have you have you had any experience with it at all
not really
but ive always worked on a university level
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff
uh-huh
so what do you think about that
i dont think theyre very accurate
because i know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test
and i know they changed afterwards
right
right
i know of that too
and i also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off
and you cannot get a job because of it uh-huh
yeah
i had a friend
it didnt cause her any problems with her job
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen
but what it was was she had been in the jungle
and it was some malaria medication
and she tested positive for that
and so it really is a dangerous thing that way
because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didnt get the job
and they werent told why
but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing
or they would tell you
or this person never use any drugs
i always
i thought you got called back if you tested positive for more tests
you should
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something
i have real mixed feelings about it
i dont know
do you know how wrong they are
is there a margin of error
the accuracy
i dont know
i dont know
but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
yeah
and if you could show that
i interviewed for a job recently
and i was taking $unc$entex and my doctor gave me a prescription for it
uh-huh
and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you
and it didnt come up that i needed to do it
but this could happen to anybody
and if they would just say this persons drug test is positive we wont hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you didnt do anything
yeah
yeah
so i dont know
and im not so sure they are that needed ye-
yeah
im not sure either
the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it
because they say they can spot check
if youre using it while at a job i can see a problem
yeah
but the occasional person then its almost an infringement of your privacy
it sort of is
and this is it
this
im not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from $unc$two ways
as a health professional i wouldnt want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs
yeah
so as a patient i feel we probably should be protected
but on the other hand theres a lot of things i should be protected from that they dont test my patients for too
so i guess you have to have trust some place along the way
yeah
you cant go around testing everybody for everything
yeah
so i dont know
and i think it could be used to hassle somebody
if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this
they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess
i can see where it could become a problem
and it seems like now they have tests
i guess they can test your hair
and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
really maybe you shouldnt be held responsible for something you did several years ago
so
i know
thats the other thing
a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on
and i dont think they should really have to pay for that forever
yeah
theres a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldnt do as an adult
yeah
but you cant say it was wrong at the time
i think thats true
yeah
yeah
so that probably wouldnt be too good either
how many children do you have now
i have $unc$five
you have $unc$five
right
you do have a hard time finding time then dont you
$unc$four of them are grown
theyre in college or just out of college
so i really have just a $unc$thirteen year old at home
uh-huh
you sound so young
i work at it
all right
to have them
i try to fool everybody
i think youre doing a good job
i just have $unc$one child
uh-huh
and i dont think
theres not much i can do about it
my wife and i are in our forties
so
uh-huh
but its hard to raise $unc$one child without them thinking theyre the pivot point of the universe
i think you are right
because i was an only child too
and thats $unc$one reason i have so many because i enjoy the big family
yeah
and my $unc$thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
and so she is sort of like an only child
and its the same type of thing
uh-huh
i have a younger brother like that
im in my forties like i say
and i have a brother in his twenties
uh-huh
and i was the youngest
yeah
so i understand how that worked
and he was treated like he had $unc$five fathers or something
right
thats exactly how it is
shes got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her
when things dont go right she just calls one of them
yeah
but yeah
its a little bit difficult though
i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more
and
did you all do a lot of organized things like $unc$little $unc$league soccer
we really did not
my next oldest daughter thats in college in $unc$california is a world twirling champion
she twirls a baton
and we did a lot of things together
uh-huh
she and i did a lot of things together and flew
we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
uh-huh
and that was a lot of fun
but i guess you could consider that organized
there is a competition all the time
yeah
we were very heavy into that
other than that they were pretty much
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
i think thats probably true the
if you have $unc$one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities
uh-huh
and if you have a large number of children then you dont
you cant afford to
no
you ca-
and theres not enough time
right
my son is in $unc$little $unc$league this year
hes $unc$ten
and they practice $unc$three times a week
and they have a game
and its just if there were more than $unc$one child i dont know there would be no way to do it
right
thats right
$unc$one parent go $unc$one direction
and id have to go in the other
and we could only cover $unc$two at that
uh-huh
yeah
i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice
she had to go with me
uh-huh
so the $unc$three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing
and of course the competing itself really didnt matter what it was
it was making the friends and going all the places
and it was a really neat experience
but it took our total time
i did not work when i did this
now i do work full-time
uh-huh
and its just my $unc$thirteen year old and myself
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
so
i dont think although i think $unc$three children is probably the ideal to me
but im not sure i could afford $unc$three
i most certainly couldnt educate $unc$three
i dont know how my parents did it
yeah
there were $unc$five of us
and i dont recall wanting anything in particular
but i dont know how my father did it
he worked at a truck line
and he just didnt make that kind of money with $unc$five children
but we did okay
we had a house and a home and
but now my wife and i both work
and i dont believe we have as much as my parents did
and we only have $unc$one child
really
uh-huh
things cost a lot more
i dont know how it is in $unc$georgia
and i dont think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
$unc$atlanta is horrible
is it
yes
we have a lot of people moving here from $unc$boston and different areas
and from talking to them theyre shocked
really
wha-
and they
the housing is so cheap in comparison to $unc$boston that they jump on it
right
thats what ive heard
they sell their house
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here
and i work with a lot of them
they think they have really done something
then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to where they came from
yeah
the housing is cheaper
but thats about it
im surprised to hear that
ive heard very positive things about $unc$atlanta
so
okay
im not as ashamed to claim them this year as i have been so
it
lets put it this way
weve got the $unc$new $unc$england $unc$patriots up here
so
yeah
right
theyve had some serious problems in the past couple of years
really
yeah
why
partly due to ownership
$unc$victor $unc$kiam owned the $unc$patriots for a period of a number of years
uh-huh
and he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
and theyve had some financial problems with the team and so forth
and it recently was sold to some other people
so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the $unc$patriots in the $unc$new $unc$england area anyways
yeah
it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you
yeah
ive been to a few games before
uh-huh
now youre from $unc$texas
right
so youve got $unc$two football teams down there
it depends on where youre from in $unc$texas
i live right by $unc$dallas so we have $unc$one football team as far as were concerned
uh-huh
i see
thats how it is
theres that type of segregation
its divided
yeah
wow!
it really is
so weve got our $unc$cowboys here
and i dont think anybody roots differently
uh-huh
but i have a boyfriend that lives in $unc$fresno
do you
and he is for the $unc$raiders $unc$l a $unc$raiders
uh-huh
so
do you follow professional sports at all
i just started to this year because of these silly $unc$raiders that didnt do very well
but ive been trying more this year
i think i know a little more than i use to
yeah
i never knew very much at all
so im trying
its a good past time
yeah
particularly football
they say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field
and supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football
and they get together with a bunch of guys
and they have a good time and everything
and thats suppose to be some of the male bonding and the male instincts i guess or something about the
so i shouldnt even try to do it
no
its good in terms of a contest
yes
i think that
i personally like hockey better because its a contact sport
it has the speed
right
and the hand eye coordination
and it takes a certain skill to play hockey
not everybody can play hockey
yeah
so we
and
thats
were a big hockey area up here
i bet up here in $unc$new $unc$england as well as in the $unc$minnesota area
really
but
i dont even think we have that in $unc$texas
what hockey
we might
do we
no
you probably know
i dont know
no
theres no hockey
theres no
nobody talks about it
so i dont think we do
theres no professional hockey teams in $unc$texas
no
uh-huh
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes
we dont even have that very much
so
yeah
i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now
uh-huh
they have this $unc$world $unc$football $unc$league
you see we have the $unc$n $unc$f $unc$l that $unc$dallas and $unc$houston are in and $unc$new $unc$england $unc$patriots and $unc$l $unc$a $unc$raiders and those teams
yeah
there are those teams that play in $unc$national $unc$football $unc$league
but now they have whats called the $unc$world $unc$football $unc$league
and they have all these teams from
theres a team in $unc$london
and theres other european teams
oh
and theres teams in the $unc$united $unc$states
and theyre playing now during the summer months
and its really overkill
yeah
and theres only so much football you can watch
yeah
i like to do
i dont like to watch
yeah
thats good
i dont like to watch anything
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff
i think its an excuse to do nothing
and i can see what youre saying about the male bonding
and the guys get together
yeah
and thats kind of cool
thats fun
uh-huh
but it can get really overdone
have you ever been to a professional football game
yeah
i have
have you
yeah
yeah
i have
did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
no
no
thats what you got to do
we talked our
ive done that for college football
yeah
yeah
yeah
you the
the same thing
yeah
we talked our wives
theres about $unc$six or $unc$eight guys that we use to go out for these games
and we talked our wives into going with us $unc$one time
and they had a real good time
and it was basically for the social atmosphere
right
and thats the thing
you go $unc$three or $unc$four hours before the game
you go set up
we set a table up
we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the $unc$patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more
yeah
but that whole
its not so much the contest itself and the game itself i-
yeah
that you miss sitting home in your parlor with a $unc$six pack of beer and some potato chips
thats right
you miss that
yeah
thats right
and any professional sport i think you miss that
uh-huh
the atmosphere of being there
yeah
in high school i went to every football game
and i twirled
yep
and i didnt
i still dont know that much about football obviously
but i still had a good time
well foot-
think about this
do you have children in school
i do
i have $unc$two that are now just about ready to graduate from college
but i also have $unc$two that are just entering school i think theyre just pushing them entirely to fast
so you see a big difference then in before and now do you
or
a lot of testing
it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
uh-huh
my son leaves the house at $unc$seven $unc$thirty and doesnt get home until $unc$three oclock
uh-huh
and i think thats such a long day for a kindergartner
i do too
i think thats awful
and i have a preschooler
i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten
and i thought how mature do you have to be
i know
whats the new criteria
and there is a
do you have the standardized testing now
we have all kinds of testing
and its over and over
its $unc$i $unc$t $unc$b $unc$s and just everything
yeah
and they test test test
i live in $unc$plano actually
and i dont know if youve heard of $unc$plano
but its a very transient community
no
a lot of people from everywhere
its just north of $unc$dallas
uh-huh
and its grown in leaps and bounds
we must have maybe a $unc$hundred and $unc$fifty $unc$thousand people now
oh
and most of them from other places
yeah
$unc$j $unc$c penneys come down from $unc$new $unc$york and of course $unc$t $unc$i and $unc$xerox from $unc$rochester
and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in
yeah
and its a very wealthy community
not that i am
but other people seem to be
and i would love to know why
but they do
they have
you would like to know what theyre doing right
i would
i really would
they just have beautiful beautiful homes
and they have everything
the kids only wear name brand things to school
and its $unc$one of these things
me
that makes it hard for you doesnt it
it does
it really does because im a single mom and i have a $unc$thirteen year old now
and it does
me
we do it to a point
but not to where she feels different
yeah
but some of them are very rich
its hard to explain to them why you cant
and so we just kind of have everything here
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
right
and so i dont know how much of it is us and how much of it is $unc$texas
but the kids are expected to excel in everything
dear
and its almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody cant be first
and theyre expected to be
right
their parents expect it
the teachers expect it
$unc$texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
right
and if you read national surveys theyre far from it
and so theres just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests
how about the kids
how are they coping with it
not very well
they bring home notes that say they have to get a good nights sleep and eat right in the morning before tests
they make a big deal
to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day
and say just do this
right
i just feel they do better that way
yeah
rather than anticipating
and
yeah
and i have older children too that now are out of high school
and theyve always done this here
its always been the same
but its getting worse and worse
is more pressure for everything
and i just think its really awful
and im with you on that
you dont hear too many people say this
but i think its a very long day
it is
and my feeling is that youre only a kid once and you dont want to spend your whole life in school
thats right
my son came home
and he said $unc$mom all we do is work
uh-huh
uh-huh
we hardly ever play
and
and i dont think thats right
i think we should do what $unc$europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
likewise
i dont think i should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano
right
i would like to see those things included in our school system because i think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids
wouldnt that be great
uh-huh
right
and so i just find this a real problem
i think if theyre going to be there all day they should find time
$unc$one of my daughters once was out of school with $unc$mono in her junior year i think it was
and she had a home teacher for like $unc$four hours a week
and when she went back in $unc$six weeks she was ahead
so what does that tell you
is that right
it tells you theres a whole lot of wasted time
my gosh
my gosh
and they could be using this time better
for example in my sons kindergarten theyre really finished at lunch time
after lunch they have some
im trying to think if they have recess after lunch
and then they have naps or rest period
uh-huh
and i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting
thats a very long day for kindergartners
i agree
but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this
i wouldnt be surprised
because they dont want to send them to daycare
i doubt if they would say it was too long
thats why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day
do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care
we have them at $unc$one school
what do you think
i cant be terribly authoritative on what life was like $unc$thirty years ago because im not that old yet
uh-huh
i can be
but go ahead
i know that
obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change
you didnt have video games
you didnt have home computers
you didnt have xerox machines
right
you try to
you go into a business today
and you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper
and its almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live
right
we fax everything
and
yeah
we dont even wait for the mail anymore
uh-huh
right
yeah
a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
and you had to do something
this was concerning the $unc$s $unc$e $unc$c
and so if they had business to do they had to finish it $unc$three days in advance so they could get it through the mail because you can get it there in a matter of minutes through a fax machine
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
right
because youre expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
youre expected to
exactly
and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse
it should be less because we have a microwave
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
and we can throw them in a microwave for $unc$two minutes
but the more conveniences we have the more thats expected of us
uh-huh
and we have no down time
we dont stop and wait for things to happen because we dont have to
yeah
so we keep moving
we dont stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen
we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing
so we have no relaxation time in between
uh-huh
so they say thats really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things
uh-huh
so thats good
thats an interesting point
but i just think our family lives have changed drastically
and i think thats ju-
of course a part of it is technology
our kids where would they be without $unc$nintendo and their t v shows
and no-
some of that is really bad i think
but we have all single families
so many single families now
a lot of working
both parents are working
so theres a whole big effect on our kids
and not very many of my daughters friends really are on their original mother and father
im wondering what this is going to do in $unc$ten and $unc$twenty years
theres that
and theres the fact that nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen
the $unc$u $unc$s would be actually declining in population slightly if it werent for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
youre probably right
and im an $unc$o $unc$b nurse
and thats never really occurred to me but thats interesting
i never really thought about it that way
yeah
yeah
i saw the numbers on that awhile back
and i was uh-huh
so
yeah
yeah
thats true
when is this good or not good
in terms of the long term effect on $unc$america in terms of the culture and everything i dont know
we dont know that yet
in an extremely large part of the next generation is going to be second generation from immigrant parents
yeah
i dont know either
thats true
and theyre going to be really struggling
and i dont think that $unc$america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good
right
right
its no longer the accomplishment that it once was
and not that many people are really trying i dont think
yeah
yeah
thats kind of scary
thats true
but i
its just very different
and i guess every $unc$ten years its just been very different
yeah
and i dont know whats going to happen
i know what im seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that theyre establishing careers
yeah
tha-
and theyve got their homes
and theyve got
okay $unc$randall
do you have any special interest in space flight
yeah
ever since i was a young and used to watch the old $unc$apollo missions going off in classroom t v
uh-huh
i suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off
uh-huh
very exciting
yeah
the
ive always wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that and to meet and to see it actually happen
uh-huh
of course ive really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
uh-huh
but that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
what do you do now
computer programmer
oh
unfortunately that can be done from the ground
yeah
to bad
yeah
made the wrong career choice to get up into space
the
i used to think when i was younger that by this time wed have lots more stuff in space than we do now
uh-huh
uh-huh
frustrating at times
uh-huh
i dont know what you think about all that
im kind of young
im only $unc$twenty-two
and so im not
theres a lot thats happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties
uh-huh
although i have a and whatnot
yeah yeah
it would be great if we could find some way to use that to boost the economy
the
ive always felt that $unc$one of the long-term solutions would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up
uh-huh
because thats a singularly renewable resource that doesnt require any particularly nasty environment impact
exactly
and you can just get as much power as you need up there
uh-huh
its just a matter of how big you build it
uh-huh
and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing
so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good very very good for everyone in the long run is some of the other things id like to see happen would happen also
so im
right
yeah
it seems like theres
so youre talking about positive side effects then
yeah
right
okay
i understand
right
sure
that makes a lot of sense
right
the only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
uh-huh
yeah
and they want to do the research
and theyre all nor-
yeah
the only commitments that theyre interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to $unc$mars which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
right
exactly
but the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth
uh-huh
it would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for
uh-huh
we should eventually send people to $unc$mars but not just because its glitzy to do so
right
we should do it for the return we get for it
uh-huh
and unfortunately thats not what i thinks happened
exactly
least not
i would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the
but
yeah
the downside of that is after you do $unc$one of those people say we did it
right
now were done
now were done
no need to play around with this space stuff anymore
thats what happened with $unc$apollo but id give almost anything to get into space
yeah
i think youre right
i would too
id
was it $unc$john $unc$denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle
i guess by what you said you dont feel your privacy has been invaded anytime recently
no
not really
the only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls
uh-huh
thats the only thing that bothers me
thats not really invading my privacy
right
do you feel that yours is invaded
no
i wouldnt call it invading my privacy by any means
i would
theres a lot of times though you get those calls when youre sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot
and next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that
and its real hard to tell them that youre not interested
or you do tell them youre not interested
and they still keep asking you and keep badgering you about it
and that aggravates me
but i dont know that you could call that invading my privacy
because if we dont want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look i want my name unlisted or want my
but that doesnt work
it doesnt
no
because a lot of times they dial sequentially
they get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything
uh-huh
you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something
you put your phone number on there
they pass your phone number on to another company
oh
or you
or the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff
the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
and while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they
uh-huh
you call me one more time im going to stop subscribing
and the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list
and yeah
you call up during regular hours
they have a special department
theyll take your numbers out of their lists
uh-huh
but the $unc$orlando paper they refused to take it off of the lists
and they call every month
and when you have more than $unc$one phone number you get a call on each number you have
good grief
let me ask you about this
heres something that has been kind of concerning me lately
my fiance received a bill from a $unc$lord and $unc$taylor company
theyre a department store
uh-huh
she received a bill from them that she had visited some sto-
and i think it was there in $unc$florida
maybe it was in $unc$miami
that she had visited a store there
and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over $unc$two $unc$hundred dollars worth of merchandise
uh-huh
and the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in $unc$denver with me for $unc$thanksgiving
uh-huh
and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
uh-huh
and ive heard recently that this is a common occurrence where people are using s-
they use $unc$joe blows social security number and can potentially ruin someones credit
uh-huh
if you know a persons social security number and their mailing address and their mothers maiden name you can basically become that person
if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
uh-huh
and since it wasnt shipped to her address she could prove that it wasnt her
if it was some coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document
yeah
and wh-
the signature
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature
and if they cant provide a signature theyll have to eat the charge
yeah
y-
but if the pers- has her social security number id be real concerned that shes not blacklist on what is it its $unc$telecredit or something
yeah
because she wont be able to cash checks because most places verify through there
she probably wont be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
yeah
we got it cleared up eventually
what happened
not very good
its not been a good day
i turned mine in about $unc$twelve hours early at noon
i dont know
i finished mine up about $unc$eleven and left it here with $unc$carolyn
so i hope shes turned it in
are you eating
i ju-
go ahead
ill stop eating
i just barely got home from the university
no its
say what
i just barely got home from the university
tell you what we can do is i can punch the $unc$one
and then after $unc$five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want
okay
go ahead
fire away
i love the irony of talking about this subject on $unc$april the fifteenth
but im afraid im probably in the minority
i actually dont think that we pay too much in this country particularly in this part of the country w-
i agree with you
i guess i do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed
i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an $unc$eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
and the sales tax cant
i think thats regressive
and its kind of dumb
i hate the $unc$eight and a half percent sales tax
but on the other hand i dont mind that its only on things that arent like groceries and that
its not on that
nobody taxes groceries
yeah
they do
where
in $unc$arizona
is that right
uh-huh
but we have a pretty low tax rate here
i think the sales tax they just got to do something about it
right
but thats the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
right
but i guess when i see the comparison between the $unc$united $unc$states and any other western country their rates are $unc$forty-one $unc$forty-two and ours are $unc$thirty-six $unc$thirty-seven
if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well
theres no other country that is taxed as low as we are
and i still think that having lived in $unc$europe for awhile difference in living conditions are certainly well worth what we pay for it
yeah
uh-huh
im not sure i understand what you mean
i think
i was in $unc$germany for several years
right
and id a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
you mean lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes
yeah
higher taxes
yeah
i suppose thats true
yeah
probably less so now than it was $unc$ten years ago or whatever
but
stills that way to some extent
yeah
i think the other problem is its easy to complain about taxes because theres something you theoretically can do something about
right
but i look for example
and youre not quite in the same situation
but school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world
right
i wish i didnt have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes
right
yeah
yeah
since i send my kids to parochial school that
yeah
thats probably a little tougher on you
its not quite the bargain that
but i pay them gladly
thats a decision
i think its a dumb decision on our part because countries like $unc$canada and $unc$england and $unc$germany do perfectly well with a $unc$two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money
but thats the way $unc$americans want to interpret it
i guess thats all right
but
yeah
i
and if i were
when i was single and again when im retired i will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good
thats always been a high priority
no
i think thats just you though
i do
yeah
thats true
i think in places like $unc$california people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they cant get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
yeah
and there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they cant get anything done
that seems like a cultural lapse
people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools
they
of course i think with the graying of $unc$america were going to see that problem in lots of places
right
yeah
people would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them
but i think its sad selfish and shortsighted
or build roads
yeah
