    "It is  common to use one-hot representation as input in Natural Language Processing tasks. In Keras, the Embedding layer takes an index as an input and convert it to one-hot vector with the length of the vocabulary size. Then multiplies these vectors by a normal weight matrix. But there is no way to only get a one-hot vector as the output of a layer in Keras. To solve this we use Lambda() layer and a function that creates the one-hot layer. "

    "The model is taking longer to reach the same training accuracy as the earlier one, this may be becaseu it has more parameters to train. We can combat this by training the model for longer. We would also expect to see the model suffer more from overfitting because there are more parameters but no additional data. Overfitting can be defended against by introducing dropout layers to the model or by increasing the number of samples in our dataset. "
